The AWFF 2016 TNT festival is being hosted by The Caribbean Travelling Film School and the UWI Film Program. The AWFF is dedicated to films from or about Africa and African diaspora or films from producers or directors from the same locales. Pretty much films from everywhere. The 28 films being screened have been selected from 24 different countries so there is a very wide selection in terms of origin as well as genre. Most people may think of documentaries as boring talking heads type of films, but nothing can be further from the truth. Modern documentaries run the gamut from serious drama to light comedy. They only have one thing in common. They are real stories about real people or events, but they are told in all the varying ways that modern narrative films have encompassed. Directors such as Michael Moore, who made many popular documentaries such as Bowling for Columbine, Sicko and of course Fahrenheit 9/11, have made the genre into a mainstream format, so much so that there are documentary categories at the Oscars, in recognition of the quality of these films. The AWFF is actually a travelling film festival and it is screened in the USA, the Caribbean, Africa and the UK, so it''s quite fitting that it is being hosted by the Caribbean Travelling Film School. In addition, the curator of the festival, Dr. ''Niyi Coker Jr., is a lecturer at the film school and has taught the directing workshops both in Barbados and in Trinidad. Professor Coker is the E. Desmond Lee Distinguished Professor of Theatre and Media Studies at the University of Missouri, Saint Louis. He has directed over fifty major stage productions around the world. His narrative feature “Pennies for the Boatman”, won Best Screenplay at the 2012 Madrid International Film Festival and was a finalist for Best Director and Best Film. His latest documentary film “Ota Benga: Human at the Zoo” has already won the award for Best Scientific & Educational film as well as the Best Director of a Documentary award at the prestigious. London International Film Festival The Caribbean Travelling Film School is the English Caribbean''s first and only institution dedicated entirely and only to teaching film fundamentals. It was established seven years ago by three Caribbean film makers as a way to train prospective crew members in the different islands, to help jump start the fledgling film industry in the Caribbean. Through workshop programs in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, the school has brought film making to the masses and trained dozens of potential film producers in the art and science of film production. The school''s headquarters and studio are at 23 Gordon St, in Port of Spain in the middle of the district that houses the major learning institutions in Port of Spain. St Mary''s College, Bishop Anstey''s, St Joseph Convent, COSTATT and UTT NAPA are all within two blocks of the film school. This year''s edition of the festival is being screened at both the film school''s studio and at the much more spacious screening facility of the UWI Film Program. The festival starts on Wednesday 16th March and runs through Saturday 19th March with three screenings at 2 pm, 5 pm and 8 pm daily. The screenings are repeated at the UWI venue at the same times on the following days, starting on Thursday 17th March. All screenings are free and as they say, open to the public. The 8 pm screening on Wednesday 16th at the film school will be preceded by a cocktail launch and is by invitation only. The festival is sponsored by the lead sponsor HADCO and its brands Obikwa Wines of South Africa and Emborg and by the Cocoa Pod Chocolate Shop and Alternative and Biologic Solutions, distributor of Mosquito Dunks.', 1),

He further stated that he at one time accompanied other officers to the small red-brick house in which Naipaul-Coolman was allegedly killed and found a pool table.However, forensic examinations carried out on those items did not provide anything of evidential value. Maers is one of the States final witnesses before it closes its case against the 12 men accused of murdering Naipaul-Coolman. There are just about four more witnesses to testify before it does so in the trial which has been ongoing since March 24 last year. The prosecution has called close to 70 witnesses so far.It is contending that the Chaguanas businesswoman was kept in the red-brick house for several days following her kidnapping from her Lange Park home, before she was shot once to the chest while sitting on a pool table after which her body was dismembered with an electric saw and disposed of at an unknown location.The trial is expected to resume tomorrow.', 1),

I took notice as parents with children in hand and in tow, went from shop to shop buying school supplies. For me, the scenes were instructive.\n\nFirst, it demonstrates that education is still important to Jamaicans. As hard as life is for the majority of Jamaicans, I have noticed that most parents make every effort to send their children to school even those labelled as "bad parents".\n\nMy own organisation, Hear The Children''s Cry, can attest to that fact. Weeks ago, parents began asking for assistance with their children''s book lists. Some of the parents who called me simply wanted help with portions of the lists, pointing out that they could find the rest of the money. That type of interest and action is not indicative of bad parents.\n\nOur parents by and large understand how important it is for their children to have the required books for school, even when some of them, like my own mother, didn''t know or understand the contents of the books. As a little girl, I was always intrigued and sometimes amused that my mother would shout, "Betty, go tek up you book," without any knowledge of what was written inside them. My mother, who was semi-literate, epitomised that status and station, as well as the aspirations of many parents in her generation they weren''t educated, but they understood the value of education and they wanted their children to have a better life than they had.\n\nThat sentiment has not changed, despite the significant shifts in the socio-economic and cultural life of the country. The parents of today still want to see their children achieve a better life than theirs, and the buoyancy of the "back to school" activities is a testament to that fact.\n\nI''m told that one of the biggest sellers in the wholesale markets and on the streets is spray starch, and the school uniforms tell the tale. Monday morning "back to school" is a sight to behold new shoes, perfectly starched and pleated skirts and crisp khaki uniforms adorn the educational landscape new book bags laden with books, and children bustling and hustling to school, filled with the innate hope and optimism characteristic of childhood.\n\nMany of the parents I have worked with, as well as my mother, would tell me constantly that they wished they had had certain educational opportunities as children. My mother was the eldest of 12 children and because of her mother''s untimely death was forced to drop out of school to care for her siblings. As my mother grew older she would reflect on her childhood deficits, and though she became a self-taught adult, the opportunities she lost in primary and secondary education were difficult to recover. That is the story of many parents in Jamaica, and the baseline for parenting intervention strategies.\n\nWhat Jamaican families need is an enabling environment in which their children and themselves can gain economic independence and the self-esteem and self-respect that comes with it. Employment is a key factor. Parents who are employed feel better about themselves and by extension their children. Employed parents are better able to "employ" good parenting practices. My own motto is: "Employ Parents Empower Families".\n\nBut while the entire national focus over the next few weeks will be centred on the back-to-school environment, attention must also be placed on the thousands of young people who are not going back to school. Chief among them are those who left high school without any type of certification.\n\nOver the last few weeks there has been a widespread hue and cry about this year''s poor CSEC results, especially in English language, and clearly the situation is cause for concern.\n\nBut as poor as the CSEC results were, it is not the worst story. Even more alarming is the large number of children, perhaps as many as 20,000, who were not able to sit the CSEC exams because they did not meet the required standard. It is that cohort, by and large, which helps sustain the inter-generational cycle of poverty and dependency.\n\nAdd to those numbers the large percentage of high school and tertiary graduates who, even with certification and higher educational qualifications, are unable to find employment or opportunities, or both, for furthering their education. We live in a society in which financial institutions provide loans for virtually all the material things available even, dispensing loans, I''m told, to cover season tickets for certain social events, but provide little or nothing for people wanting to educate themselves.', 1),

Or some athletic young men, putting aside their preoccupation with babes, bling and gang warfare (not necessarily in that order) and channelling all that pent-up energy and anger on the makeshift basketball court.\n\nWhatever it is, these anonymous occasions of loosely organised athletic activity seem to be much closer to the fundamental essence of sport than some of the global mega-events that preoccupy the attention of hundreds of millions of fans around the planet whose list of priorities is topped by the need to ensure that the cable TV bill is paid promptly and that a fraction of the monthly budget is set aside for the must-see pay-per-view events that crop up every now and then.\n\nMore and more, we''re seeing that the competition is not in the event itself, but the duel of television executives and broadcasting companies to reinvent, rebrand and aggressively market variations from the traditional fare, or at least present the old stuff as something different, just to ensure that the target audience, which has so many options to choose from, stays interested.\n\nYou look at a lot of international football and wonder what all the fuss is about. Mediocrity and boring predictability, even with enhanced crowd sound effects and an excitable commentator, is still mediocrity and boring predictability. Former national player Carlton Franco, back home for the launch of the Veteran Footballers Foundation two Sundays ago, wasn''t as harsh as that but essentially said the same thing when comparing the systems and regimented structure of the modern game with the improvisation (critics will say disorganisation) and intuitive thinking that was demanded in the days when he played in front of the Grandstand.\n\nPete Sampras, still the holder of the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles at 14, was last week lamenting the growing one-dimensional nature of men''s tennis with the vast majority of players on the professional circuit Roger Federer is the one notable exception preferring to stay on the baseline and exchange booming groundstrokes and passing shots with their opponents, thanks in no small measure to advanced technology that gives the modern exponent more power of shot than even the champions of previous eras ever managed off their racquet strings.\n\nIn the face of such repetitiveness, somebody with enough influence always comes up with a bright made-for-TV idea, like last year''s three-match series between Federer and Sampras or the one-off event that pitted Federer against Rafael Nadal, with one side of the court being carpet and the other clay. And let us not forget that Sir Allen Stanford''s "20/20 for Twenty" is just another manifestation of the attempt to cash in on the rising tide of popularity in this newest and shortest form of international cricket to the extent that it threatens the viability, if not the existence, of the traditional variety.\n\nSuch gimmickry and artificiality fly in the face of what a sporting contest should really be about, but as long as there are enough people prepared to pay enough money for such glorified non-events, they will continue to prosper.\n\nWhich is why Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao met in the ring in Las Vegas on Saturday night for a non-title event that was typical of the stage-managed sideshow that professional boxing has become.\n\nThis latest so-called "Superfight" ended after the eighth round with the 29-year-old Filipino, generally regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter today, dominating the American from start to premature finish. De la Hoya, stopped for only the second time in his 16-year professional career, hardly mustered a serious challenge and later conceded that he didn''t have what it takes anymore, physically, to be competitive with the very best in the business.\n\nGet caught up with news from the news leader\nSubscribe now and get access to the Trinidad Express E-paper\nYet his lack of energy would be no surprise to those familiar with the challenges of a heavier fighter losing a considerable amount of weight to make the 147lb welterweight category, a division that de la Hoya hadn''t fought at for seven years. Indeed, it was speculated that, in the time between the weigh-in the previous day and the opening bell on Saturday night, de la Hoya would have been back up almost to 160lbs, all of which would have taken a serious toll on his effectiveness when it really mattered in the ring.\n\nOn the other hand, Pacquiao had to move up two weight classes to compete as a welterweight, a task the medical experts say would not have been as challenging and physically taxing as the weight-loss that de la Hoya had to undergo to meet the requirements of the fight.\n\nSo why go through all of that for a manufactured contest in which there was no title at stake We all know what the answer is of course: money. Pacquiao earned US$11 million, his biggest purse ever. But hear this. Despite enduring the beating of his life, de la Hoya is expected to collect almost twice that amount by the time the revenue from the pay-per-view audience is assessed.\n\nNot even the old saying about the victor taking home the spoils holds true anymore in this upside-down, wheeling-and-dealing world of contemporary professional sport.\n\nAt least there''s always the Savannah.', 1),

Wray & Nephew Limited, a subsidiary of the Campari Group, a major player in the global branded beverage industry, said it had taken the decision because of the ongoing economic losses occasioned by the combined effect of escalating operational costs and the declining cost of sugar.\n“This doesn’t in any way, shape, or form signal any exiting from sugar.

Several companies dealing with environment protection supported the event, some using display booths like Carib Glassworks, Piranha International and Nigel Khan Bookstore.\n\nThis year, Allum has been involved with the mobile exhibition launched at the Savannah Terrace of the Hilton Trinidad and Conference Centre on Sunday October 3 themed "The Environment is You".\n\nThe aim of this year''s event is to sustain the effort initiated last year where the target group was schoolchildren. The exhibition is a concerted effort by a group of concerned citizens determined to make the management of the environment a priority and includes top Carnival bandleader Brian McFarlane with additional support coming from bpTT, Piranha International and Green Cyclone Inc.\n\nThe theme encapsulates a continuing intent to sensitise not only children but every citizen to caring for the environment. While corporations and government play a critical role, everyone can contribute to ''keeping a clean scene'' through little efforts that can make a large difference every day.\n\nGiving a few examples which cause environmental damage and their consequences, Allum listed the following: *The seemingly small action of throwing a cigarette butt through the window of a moving car can result in huge losses via a tragic fire. *Surface vegetation loss causes extensive erosion and during heavy rains assists voluminous unchecked flows of water into low lying areas creating havoc with life and property. *The reckless and irresponsible dumping of waste into our waterways has left many families without homes, children struggling to get to school and crops totally decimated and where no insurance coverage for this type of risk is available.\n\nSo not only lives, but livelihoods are affected in so many ways. Most importantly many of our hard working citizens are stripped of their dignity as the most affected must seek assistance from friends, strangers and the State.\n\nThis year''s project seeks to inform, educate and sensitise the wider public to small conscious actions that can have a strong and sustainable impact on securing the health of our environment, for our present and future generations.\nWhile last year the group focused primarily on youth, this year the efforts embrace the wider public, encouraging small changes in behaviour that could impact the environment in very significant ways.\n\nThe travelling exhibition comprises graphic photos which juxtapose irresponsible behaviour with the images of the pristine beauty. Such beauty we can achieve if only minds and destructive attitudes are altered.\n\nThe concept of the travelling exhibition is the first of its kind, in that it will be moved from location to location taking its message throughout Trinidad and Tobago. The exhibit will be placed at Better Value at Gulf View Link Road, San Fernando this weekend.', 1),

Your heart goes out to the people who have lost their lives. The incident has to be seen in its historical context. There has always been migration of people in the world, and they have lost their lives fleeing untenable conditions. It happens in many parts of the world, and this is close to home so we are more ­affected and impacted.\n“Such a situation is quite intolerable. It is heartbreaking.

Now I think Trinidad and Tobago might wish to take an initiative in stages to ­prevent things like that from happening again.\n\n“It also tells us about the need for urgency. It should be not just seen as news... as just a sea tragedy, but as heart-wrenching incidents that stir us into finding another solution and ­another way of looking at things.”\n\nDookeran also said: “East Indian immigration happened about 150 years ago, and in contemporary times, we should not see it as a ­natural course. It will continue. There should be a step-by-step solution. It is about engaging all the parties, including the (Nicolas) Maduro regime and the Opposition (Juan Guaido).

Bartholomew was speaking at a press conference held Monday at the MRF''s offices at Queen''s Park East, Port of Spain. He said it was a disgrace that the Foundation could not even afford to attend and present research papers at annual international HIV conferences abroad, because of a lack of funding. MRF financial resource manager Natasha Singh revealed that the Foundation currently owes in excess of $117,000 in rent and more than half a million dollars to various creditors. Bartholomew said for the past several years, the MRF has submitted yearly audited financial reports to the Ministry of Health, justifying the need for certain sums of money, without success. To add insult to injury, he said, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Colin Furlonge requested in a letter dated March 18 to the HIV/AIDS Co-ordinating Unit that the MRF and all other treatment centres provide a detailed report for the last ten years of HIV services provided including the number of new and repeat patients on a monthly basis. Bartholomew said this would be an exhausting procedure as the MRF is being asked to submit invoices for every single thing, including tissue paper. He said this move would further delay the disbursement of funds. Bartholomew said the lack of funds was affecting the delivery of services to patients as well as research efforts. Other issues raised by MRF staff was a shortage of essential HIV/AIDS drugs and CD4 kits as well as equipment that was more than a decade old. As a result of the shortage, patients have been switched to other drugs said Ingrid Marcelline, MRF chief pharmacist. And while patients would normally receive a three-month supply of medication, now they can only get a two-week supply, she said. Marcelline said the medication must be taken every day or the patient runs the risk of becoming resistant to the treatment. The shortage, she said, was putting lives at risk.

The energy deal is the result of months of positive and relationship-building discussions between Shell and the Government.” Natural gas was once considered so useless, it was flared. Oil, after all, was the black gold. But T&T, having monetised the nuisance by-product to create an enviable industrial estate and the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in 1995, is challenged with the now, more-favoured commodity. DESPITE BPTT’s recent announcement that the infill drilling programme has not secured enough gas to satisfy its obligations to Atlantic’s Train 1 which could result in the mothballing of the plant at the end of 2019, its parent company, energy giant BP, says it remains excited about prospects in Trinidad and Tobago.

CSEC students will not have to rewrite last month’s Mathematics examination. That’s word from the Barbados-based Caribbean Examination Council (CXC), following an investigation into a cheating incident in Trinidad. The Ministry of Education fired three invigilators and several exam supervisors, after a video emerged of students of the Tranquility Government Secondary school using their cellphones and copying from each other during the May 15 CSEC Math exam. The fiasco resulted in thousands of students from across the region signing a petition calling for a resit of the exam. However, in a statement yesterday, CXC’s Registrar made it clear that this will not happen. It said after receiving written reports, examining other material and following due diligence, it appeared that there was no breach of examination papers before or during the time of the exams. “However, it is clear that there was lapse supervision in some examination centres. That has been addressed,” CXC assured. “Any irregularities in any centre will be addressed as is done after every examination. As such there will be no re-sit of any CXC examination which has already been taken,” it stated. “The Registrar wishes to give the assurance that the principle of fairness will be paramount in our dealings with these unfortunate incidents,” the statement went on. According to CXC guidelines, exam candidates are not allowed to bring any unauthorized material or devices into the examination room, communicate in any way with each other or indulge in any other form of unfair or dishonest practice. Penalties for breaching these rules include cancellation of a candidate’s exam papers, disqualification or a ban from writing future exams offered by CXC.

Dr Winford James The Keith Rowley administration last Friday tabled a bill on local government reform without setting a date when the debate would start, and that has immediately caused UNC political leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar’s hackles to rise. She is suspicious that the administration wants to postpone the local government elections which are due later this year. The bill is called The Miscellaneous Provisions (Local Government Reform) Bill and it seeks to extend the tenure of councillors by a fourth year. Ms Persad-Bissessar thinks it is “now a backdoor way” to postpone the elections to 2021 when the latter are due by November 29 this year but, in typical Trinbagonian style, she blustered, “(W)henever they call it, it’s licks like peas! (I)t’s licks, licks, licks! Is blows, blows, blows!” She argues — tongue in cheek, no doubt — that since the Prime Minister decides when to call a general election but that since incumbent, Dr Rowley, must do so by November 20, 2020, in keeping with the law, he might be planning to hold both local and general elections on the same date in order to “create chaos”. I find Ms Persad-Bissessar’s statements consistent with her record of both condemning postponements of local government elections (by the PNM) and holding them when they were due on her watch as prime minister. But I also find her to be self-righteous in holding that the PNM wants to postpone the elections since they don’t have enough time to take the recently tabled bill through Parliament and hold the elections by November 29 this year. Let’s do a brief history of her consistency and self-righteousness — using the testimony of her own words in a post-Cabinet press conference in August 2013. First, the merest of backgrounds. The life of the municipalities had come to an end on July 26, 2013 and she had decided that her government would not postpone the local elections, which would be held on October 21 that same year, but would be preceded by a bill to reform the local government system. Which therefore gave her just under three months in which to table the bill, have it debated in the Parliament, and hold the elections — less time than the PNM have. Not unexpectedly, she was accused by the PNM of wanting to postpone the elections, which accusation turned out to be wrong. And now to what she said in the press conference. She opens her statement with the headline: “People’s Partnership government does not propose to postpone local government elections and also proposes to lay in Parliament a Bill to amend the Municipal Corporations Act, 1990.” Then she goes on to divide the statement into the following headings: • Local Government Elections will be held on time • Postponement of the Local Government elections by the PNM • The Value of the Right to Vote • Manifesto promise • Patron of the Local Government Forum of the Commonwealth • The Admitted Need for Local Government Reform • Municipal Corporations Act over 20 years old • Proportional Representation – Principles of Fairness Group. Under the heading “Local Government Elections will be held on time”, she declared: “Today I confirm to you that although it remains open to the Government to pass legislation to postpone any elections, the local government elections shall not be postponed.” She explained that, following a meeting of the National Executive Council of the UNC, she had told the nation that former UNC councillors had proposed that the local elections “should be postponed in order to facilitate the implementation of this Government’s proposal for local government reform.” So then it was a proposal by UNC people which she was rejecting; she had no intention of postponing the elections, and actually did not postpone them. Under “Postponement of the Local Government Elections by the PNM”, she noted that she was “on record as having condemned the former PNM regime —(Manning’s) —for suppressing the voice of the people by postponing local government elections for over four years during the period 2006-2010.” She also observed that during the period 1962-1968 and 1974-1977, the PNM had also postponed local elections on three occasions. Under “The Value of the Right to Vote”, she suggested that “[t]he postponement of any election which is constitutionally due must only be countenanced in the most exceptional and extreme circumstances’ (such as war and famine).” Under “Manifesto Promise”, she averred that her “entire political career ha[d] been based on respect for the voice of the people” and that she was “not about to change that now”. The 2010 manifesto had declared their commitment to “a genuine participatory democracy.” Under “Patron of the Local Government Forum of the Commonwealth”, she declared that postponement of local government elections was “alien to the concept of people-centred development” and that as a patron of the Forum she was “at the forefront of the international movement for the reform and strengthening of local government to give greater power to the people.” Under “The Admitted Need for Local Government”, she listed attempts at local government from 1965 to 2006 to show the need for local government reform. Under “Municipal Corporations Act over 20 years old”, she emphasised the need to revisit the 1990 Act to address the needs of the 21st century environment. And under “Proportional Representation — Principles of Fairness Group”, she promoted proportional representation as a fair basis for framing reform. So from the facts of her statement, the matter is clear. Kamla Persad-Bissessar has been against postponement of local government elections, and her fear of a PNM postponement of this year’s elections is not unreasonable given the PNM’s record. NELSON Mandela said education is the most powerful weapon to change the world. From the start of this administration, I called for a “special focus” on underperforming schools, a major contributor to the dangerous social decay in this country. THERE are many issues other than the NAR’s bungling of the aftermath of the 1990 attempted coup with which I would like to engage. THE Government should not place too much confidence in its own statistics regarding the number of Venezuelan refugees in this country.

Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Samsung is among the few companies that are primed for a hyper-connected, intelligent future. Through SmartThings solutions, Samsung’s vision is to provide an open and seamless IoT experience with fewer boundaries. To that end, Samsung will enhance its ecosystem by opening its SmartThings Cloud to global partners, providing developers with easy-to-use SDKs, and expanding the availability of SmartThings to more devices. While the phrase the Fourth Industrial Revolution has yet to fully catch on with the general public, if you have been paying attention to consumer electronics news you likely have come across the excitement being generated by up-and-coming technologies, like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI). Industry pundits say 5G and AI are quintessential to ushering in Industry 4.0, which will fundamentally alter how people live and work. The future of hyper-connectedness, automation, and artificial intelligence, however, is not something that is light years away. People are already living this vision. Just look beneath the hood of your smart device. Smartphones nowadays are equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU) - an advanced microprocessor, dedicated to on-device AI-related tasks. This has led to improvements in the performance of smartphones with increased CPU/ GPU speeds, enhanced data security and battery life, among other things. Smart TVs are getting smarter, too. For instance, take Samsung’s Quantum Processor 8K, the industry’s first AI-powered picture processing engine, which can upscale content to appear in 8K quality regardless of the original source or format. Of course, to fully tap into the potential of 5G and AI, you need more than cuttingedge hardware; advancements in software and network solutions are equally critical. Samsung can attest to the importance of versatility. Samsung is uniquely positioned, with its diverse product portfolio and business scale to bring to life a truly connected. A Day for Telecommunication World Telecommunication Day (WTD) has been celebrated annually on 17 May since 1969. The date marks the anniversary of the founding of ITU on 17 May 1865, when the first International Telegraph Convention was signed in Paris. With the growth in importance of information technology alongside telecommunications – especially the Internet – it was recognised that the topic also needed to be brought to public attention. The aim of this day is to focus on the importance of these technologies and the wide range of related social and economic issues. When you combine the half-a-billion devices that Samsung sells every year and its leadership in semiconductors, displays, TVs and home appliances, the 50-year-old electronics giant says it has a deeper understanding and insight over how consumers interact with its devices. Combining its multiple consumer touchpoints, it has an opportunity to truly enrich peoples’ experiences and interactions with technology. May 17, 2019. Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.

Sources told the Sun­day Guardian that the Ja­maican man in his ear­ly 20s had ar­rived in Trinidad aboard a Caribbean Air­lines flight from Kingston, Ja­maica, on Fri­day night. The man who has sev­er­al pend­ing drug-re­lat­ed mat­ters in Ja­maica had at­tempt­ed to en­ter Trinidad three times be­fore, but was stopped and placed on a flight back to Ja­maica. Sources said the man—who once lived here and has chil­dren re­sid­ing here—again tried to reen­ter the coun­try. Sun­day Guardian was in­formed that the man was stopped by im­mi­gra­tion au­thor­i­ties and lat­er placed in an im­mi­gra­tion de­ten­tion hold­ing room at the air­port. "They were plan­ning to send him back on a Sat­ur­day flight to Kingston," a source ex­plained. How­ev­er, when im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers went to check on the man around 3:30 am on Sat­ur­day, he could not be found. The of­fi­cers lat­er dis­cov­ered that the man had re­moved a ceil­ing tile in the roof of the room and climbed in­side the area. Sources said they be­lieve the man crawled through the air ducts and was able to gain ac­cess to a pub­lic area where he lat­er jumped down and es­caped from the air­port. Im­mi­gra­tion au­thor­i­ties swept the air­port for sev­er­al hours look­ing for the run­away sus­pect but he could not be found.

I love all the chil­dren, but some­times, there’s a spe­cial some­thing that is un­ex­plain­able. His mom de­scribes him as a ‘light’ and hon­est­ly, I think that’s the most ac­cu­rate word to de­scribe him. I have had the plea­sure of hear­ing him sing one of my favourite gospel songs ‘Break Every Chain’ and with such in­ten­si­ty, and I am cer­tain his chains will be bro­ken. JBF talks had the plea­sure of chat­ting with his mom, and her love for him shone as bright as the sun, the ul­ti­mate light. Em­brac­ing Moth­er­hood Moth­er­hood is not some­thing I took light­ly. In the be­gin­ning, I was very ex­cit­ed to be a moth­er; I al­ways want­ed a child. I wasn’t very close with my moth­er grow­ing up. It wasn’t that we didn’t talk but, we were al­ways far apart be­cause I stayed by my oth­er fam­i­ly a lot. Even though we were not very close, I still learned some­thing from my par­ents. I felt such a dis­con­nect from my moth­er grow­ing up and thus, I nev­er want­ed my chil­dren to feel that way with me. I told my­self that I would make sure that my chil­dren al­ways felt my pres­ence, even if I was not around: “Mom­my is just a phone call away.” Al­though Ash­ton would have tak­en up a lot of my at­ten­tion, I al­ways tried to make time for my oth­er chil­dren. Ash­ton is every­thing I dreamed of, he is a light in my life and we have a spe­cial bond. There is not a day that I wake up, with­out thank­ing God for my son. Even when I am go­ing through stress, he puts a smile on my face—re­gard­less of how bad it may seem. We un­doubt­ed­ly have a spe­cial con­nec­tion. It was very chal­leng­ing when he be­came sick, but I still couldn’t be away from him. One night, his fa­ther stayed with him and I felt like I was miss­ing a piece of my­self. We have such a strong bond that when we are apart, I can­not func­tion, and he can­not func­tion. Once, his teacher called me say­ing, “Ash­ton said he can­not do work be­cause his mom­my is not here to do work with him and that he miss­es you.” And Then There Were Two His sis­ter, Kay­la, got an ear in­fec­tion while Ash­ton was in the hos­pi­tal. Kay­la had to go through six surg­eries and many months in the hos­pi­tal, but still, they be­lieve there was a 50 per cent chance she would be able to hear. Now, I have two of my chil­dren that need my con­stant at­ten­tion. It was hard for me be­cause I was dev­as­tat­ed when Ash­ton got can­cer and now, my daugh­ter was sick. There was not enough of mom­my to go around then, I had to de­cide who I spent more time with. Ash­ton’s can­cer was more se­ri­ous, so I stayed with him more. How­ev­er, I al­ways re­mind­ed Kay­la and my youngest, Ash­lyn, that mom­my is al­ways there for them and loves them. Kay­la’s ill­ness af­fect­ed her fa­ther more than me be­cause they have a bond like Ash­ton and me. Two years ago, there was a fire that oc­curred at our home; my fam­i­ly lost every­thing; my chil­dren had noth­ing but the clothes on their backs. We are still try­ing to fig­ure out if my daugh­ter’s ear in­fec­tion is due to the fire. Re­la­tion­ship with my chil­dren I had to talk to my kids about Ash­ton be­ing sick and what that means; I ex­plained to them that mom­my will have to take care of their broth­er. The kids would al­ways ask who I love more. Kay­la feels a bit jeal­ous be­cause she does not un­der­stand why Ash­ton gets more at­ten­tion even though she is sick too. How­ev­er, Ash­lyn un­der­stands and is al­ways ex­plain­ing to Kay­la why mom­my can­not be around. Even though I could not al­ways be there phys­i­cal­ly, I would try to call them every day to main­tain an emo­tion­al con­nec­tion. I sleep with the kids every night. Every­one needs to be at­tached to mom­my in some way; Kay­la is on my bel­ly, Ash­ton in my hand and Ash­lyn on my chest. This is our time when I try to con­nect with them. My chil­dren know that they have to go to church no mat­ter what—an­oth­er time we get to be all to­geth­er. When we go to our church, Cun­jal Open Bible, we sing and praise the Lord to­geth­er and it brings us clos­er. Re­la­tion­ship with my hus­band My re­la­tion­ship with my hus­band changed when Ash­ton got sick. We be­gan to ar­gue a great deal but, we al­ways knew we had each oth­er. My hus­band is the bread­win­ner in our fam­i­ly. Hav­ing to be away from work was hard for him, but we need­ed him at home too. I need­ed his sup­port and our chil­dren need­ed him. It is al­ways a prob­lem when he has to take time off. Sup­port As a moth­er of three, I don’t get much time to my­self. Like I said, I sleep with my kids so that means even in my sleep I’m not alone. When I have a minute to my­self I use it to pray for my chil­dren and my fam­i­ly. Fam­i­ly is very im­por­tant to me and it hurts that we aren’t that close. I get sup­port from my in-laws and I’m very thank­ful. When you’re clos­er to your fam­i­ly, you feel like you have the abil­i­ty to move for­ward in life with a great sup­port sys­tem at your side. I thank God for our church too. They are my sup­port sys­tem and like a sec­ond fam­i­ly. Mem­bers of the church are al­ways pray­ing for us and they call me al­most every day to see if I’m in need of any­thing. Fu­ture for Ash­ton I be­lieve that by the grace of God Ash­ton will get bet­ter and be able to grow up and have a life away from the hos­pi­tal. I know that I raised him in the church and he will con­tin­ue to have his morals and be dri­ven by his faith. Even though he is sick, he stil­ll grabs the mic to sing on the stage. In those mo­ments, I am proud of how I raised him. He is strong, I am con­fi­dent that he al­ready knows what is right and wrong at this young age. Then Esau looked up and saw the women and chil­dren. “Who are these with you?” he asked. Ja­cob an­swered, “They are the chil­dren God has gra­cious­ly giv­en your ser­vant.” Gen­e­sis 33:5 (NIV) ', NULL),

It’s my moth­er, this is my way to show her how much I love her, right? Dis­re­gard­ing whichev­er jus­ti­fi­ca­tions oth­ers can come up with, there is ab­solute­ly noth­ing wrong in be­ing paid to care for a loved one. Al­low me to paint a typ­i­cal care­giv­ing sce­nario for you; you’ve left your job, you have util­i­ty bills to pay, you have to shop for gro­ceries, spe­cif­ic meal plans to fol­low, med­ica­tion, adult di­a­pers and spe­cial oint­ments to pur­chase, doc­tor vis­its to pay for and pos­si­bly phys­i­cal ther­a­py twice a week. You may be at the fi­nal stage of your mort­gage, have school or uni­ver­si­ty fees, have your own home, a loan and a ve­hi­cle to main­tain—this is just a drop in the buck­et for some. Let’s go a step fur­ther, you are al­so di­a­bet­ic so you need your meds, high blood pres­sure, your doc­tor vis­its, have house, ve­hi­cle, med­ical and life in­sur­ance to pay and pos­si­bly have your own home which you no longer live in full time. These cir­cum­stances can have a per­son feel­ing like his or her en­tire world is crash­ing down. Then, there’s the fam­i­ly dis­cus­sion. Your sib­lings want to hire a care­giv­er. In your head, all you can say is, “WHAT!” You just took ear­ly re­tire­ment or were pos­si­bly think­ing about tak­ing it to care for your loved one full-time, so what do you do? Well, why not sug­gest to be paid? You have bills to pay so, why not make sure that you are meet­ing your com­mit­ments by treat­ing it as a job? With this arrange­ment, both your loved one and you will ben­e­fit. One thing I al­ways preach to any care­giv­er is to write every­thing down. As a fam­i­ly care­giv­er, we are ac­count­able to log in­for­ma­tion in a book—this helps us to in­form the doc­tor of any changes in our ca­ree. Log­ging your ca­ree’s dai­ly rou­tine and any­thing else you deem rel­e­vant will en­able you to in­form the ca­ree’s fam­i­ly so that they un­der­stand that you know what you are do­ing and are work­ing close­ly with their doc­tors. You need to sell your­self to fam­i­ly mem­bers. This gives them peace of mind and as­sur­ance. Know­ing that it is not a bur­den for you and that you have struc­ture and or­der can put any­one in op­po­si­tion at ease. If you have a sys­tem in place, you can go a step fur­ther and hire a care­giv­er, once fi­nances per­mit. You will be there to en­sure that: prop­er care is giv­en, the care plan is fol­lowed and tasks are per­formed dai­ly and cor­rect­ly. You can al­so mon­i­tor how they in­ter­act with the ca­ree and vice ver­sa. This does not take away from you be­ing paid, but you may re­alise that some­one is on­ly re­quired for a cer­tain pe­ri­od dur­ing the week. How much should I get paid to care for mom or dad? Care­givers can make be­tween $20 to $30 an hour de­pend­ing on their qual­i­fi­ca­tions. In the case of a fam­i­ly mem­ber, the fam­i­ly can de­cide on a fixed day rate of $250-$300, which cov­ers 24 hours. You can de­cide charge on­ly for week­days and take the week­ends un­paid or the op­po­site. There is flex­i­bil­i­ty with how dis­cus­sion and pay­ment can go. You can de­cide if out of what you are re­ceiv­ing, you’d like to pay some­one to come in and do the house­work or re­lieve you dur­ing the day. You have con­trol over how this works for you, but every de­ci­sion must be made in the best in­ter­est of the ca­ree. Now folks, don’t go rip­ping off your fam­i­ly mem­bers. I know you are do­ing the phys­i­cal car­ing, but put your­self out of the equa­tion. Re­mem­ber, this is a con­ver­sa­tion with the fam­i­ly. You can hear them out first, find out what they are able to af­ford and based on that, you can ne­go­ti­ate. There are many fam­i­ly care­givers that are stressed, not on­ly emo­tion­al­ly or phys­i­cal­ly, but fi­nan­cial­ly. They are try­ing to do every­thing from their life sav­ings (if any), par­ent’s pen­sion or their re­tire­ment fund. Why should it be like this? Well, I think it is be­cause many of us have failed to pre­pare and plan for old age, ill­ness and care and re­cov­ery. You may al­so be in a fam­i­ly where like me, you are the on­ly child. So, what is the plan for pay­ment? First­ly, con­tact the Di­vi­sion of Age­ing and in­quire, if mom or dad qual­i­fy for a pen­sion and if there are any dis­abil­i­ty grants that are ap­plic­a­ble to their con­di­tion. Care­givers, I beg you to stop let­ting your pride get in the way, these grants and pen­sion plans are meant to as­sist per­sons in need. No one be­sides the agency will know you are get­ting this un­less you go blab­bing to every­one. So, if you have a big ego or, as we say, ‘false pride’, qui­et­ly fill out and sub­mit your forms and with a great big smile on your face, col­lect your mon­ey at the end of each month. Any as­sis­tance you re­ceive, take it, as it is bet­ter to have some­thing rather than noth­ing at all. Re­mem­ber, this is a team ef­fort; all par­ties need to be in­volved and, as much as pos­si­ble, on the same page. En­sure you have the rel­e­vant ev­i­dence like your log book, to show that you are the best per­son for this po­si­tion and why it makes more sense to pay you, rather than a stranger.

Sev­er­al Venezue­lans in To­ba­go have been charged and ap­peared in court in the last two weeks for hav­ing the fraud­u­lent ex­ten­sion stamps on their pass­ports. The most re­cent de­vel­op­ment was last Fri­day. The rash of fraud­u­lent ex­ten­sion stamps sprung up in re­cent weeks as T&T has ex­pe­ri­enced an in­flux of Venezue­lans. Most have been com­ing to try and reg­is­ter in T&T''s amnesty ex­er­cise which con­tin­ues un­til June 14. Reg­is­tra­tion will al­low Venezue­lans who are here legal­ly and il­le­gal­ly to stay in T&T and work for a year. The ex­er­cise con­tin­ued at cen­tres in Port-of-Spain, Dun­can Vil­lage, south Trinidad, and Scar­bor­ough yes­ter­day. How­ev­er, last Fri­day at the Scar­bor­ough court a Venezue­lan na­tion­al ap­peared to face a charge of hav­ing a fraud­u­lent im­mi­gra­tion ex­ten­sion stamp in his pass­port, Im­mi­gra­tion and To­ba­go po­lice of­fi­cials con­firmed. He told the court he had "giv­en his pass­port to some­one" who had ob­tained the stamp for him. Of­fi­cials said he had no at­tor­ney and plead­ed guilty. The of­fence is seen as tam­per­ing with a le­gal in­stru­ment, they added. The man was fined $3,000 and stern­ly rep­ri­mand­ed by the mag­is­trate who said it was a very se­ri­ous of­fence to have such fraud­u­lent items in an of­fi­cial doc­u­ment and a strong mes­sage had to be sent to those who try to do it. Two weeks pri­or to that, To­ba­go po­lice said four Venezue­lan men al­so ap­peared in the To­ba­go court charged with hav­ing fraud­u­lent im­mi­gra­tion ex­ten­sion stamps on their doc­u­ments. One of the men said in his de­fence that the pe­ri­od he had been al­lowed to stay for had ex­pired pre­vi­ous­ly and Im­mi­gra­tion Di­vi­sion in Trinidad had re­fused to ex­tend his stay. He claimed that some­one had ap­proached him "on the street" and he had paid $2,000 TT for an ex­ten­sion stamp that seemed re­al. The men were charged $4,000 each by the mag­is­trate. The mag­is­trate in that case al­so rep­ri­mand­ed the men, adding such acts had to be dis­cour­aged. Im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cials have ex­plained that when a stamp is test­ed un­der a cer­tain light it shows up and if it does not show, it''s not re­al. Se­nior TTPS of­fi­cials in Trinidad said they had heard of the fraud­u­lent stamps is­sue which was be­ing fol­lowed. Po­lice are al­ready prob­ing sex slave traf­fick­ing prob­lems, in­clud­ing re­gard­ing Venezue­lans, al­leged­ly in­volv­ing po­lice and oth­er of­fi­cials. To­ba­go Im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cials not­ed that last year a San Fer­nan­do court jailed a Venezue­lan fa­ther for hav­ing a pass­port with an ex­ten­sion stamp which was not au­then­tic. They al­so said last year April, a young Venezue­lan stu­dent was fined $10,000 in San Fer­nan­do for hav­ing a pass­port where the ex­ten­sion stamp for her stay in T&T was al­so fraud­u­lent. She had en­tered T&T il­le­gal­ly. They said they had not­ed the stamp is­sue was now crop­ping up in To­ba­go. Yes­ter­day, act­ing Na­tion­al Se­cu­ri­ty Min­is­ter Fitzger­ald Hinds said briefly that he was not aware of the par­tic­u­lar mat­ters in the To­ba­go court but was con­fi­dent au­thor­i­ties would pur­sue any crime that had been com­mit­ted with ap­pro­pri­ate fol­low-up ac­tion. He not­ed there had been in­stances of peo­ple be­ing charged with ut­ter­ing forged/false doc­u­ments. He said an in­ci­dent where peo­ple might have pur­chased a false item from some­one on the street who ap­proached them, raised the pos­si­bil­i­ty of a man­u­fac­tured repli­ca. Last week, To­ba­go deputy chief sec­re­tary Joel Jack had said To­ba­go''s sit­u­a­tion with the Venezue­lan in­flux is not any­thing like Trinidad''s. "We''re work­ing with Na­tion­al Se­cu­ri­ty on re­in­forced bor­der se­cu­ri­ty," he said. Both To­ba­go Im­mi­gra­tion and po­lice said that in­creased se­cu­ri­ty mea­sures in the is­land in re­cent months in­clud­ed check­ing doc­u­ments es­pe­cial­ly as num­bers of Venezue­lans there were "slight­ly up". They said the ori­gin of the fraud­u­lent ex­ten­sion stamps had to be pur­sued par­tic­u­lar­ly since "not every Venezue­lan would have ap­plied for the one-year amnesty, or might have been able to". Mean­while, se­cu­ri­ty of­fi­cials not­ed 22 ki­los of mar­i­jua­na were found in ice cream con­tain­ers on the To­ba­go fer­ry on Wednes­day.

CHAMPIONS AGAIN: Queen’s Park Cricket Club celebrate with the Sunday League 50 overs trophy following their victory over First Citizens Clarke Road United in Sunday’s final at Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba. QUEEN’S PARK Cricket Club would have been looking for more of a challenge in the Premiership T20 final on Friday night but they are still pretty ecstatic after romping to their fifth title on Friday night. The stage was set for a “North versus South” final at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba and while the Penal-based First Citizens Clarke United were closer to home and had a few seasoned players in their ranks, they were no match for the giants of the North. Set a below par 131 to win, the Parkites cruised to an emphatic nine-wicket victory with 7.5 overs to spare, with skipper Justin Guillen delivering for the second night in a row with an unbeaten 57 and Tion Webster smashing 54. Queen’s Park coach David Furlonge was pleased with the season ending victory, given the way the domestic Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board season began.

Local government councillor Chris Hosein with a police officer holding some of the marijuana plants found at the school. A protest at the unfinished Reform Hindu School turned into a police investigation on Friday. Parents entered the compound overgrown with bushes and discovered several marijuana plants. Inside the classroom, parents found a makeshift bed, two chairs and a clothing line. Local government councillor Chris Hosein, who accompanied parents, said he was informed that a man claiming to be a security guard was seen on the compound. But he was uncertain who hired the security guard. There were pieces of clothing on the line and a small radio was on the bed. Hosein said no one was inside the building when they arrived. In another classroom, parents found a kitchen outfitted with stove and utensils. But parents were furious when they discovered several marijuana plants on the compound, he said. The Gasparillo police were contacted and the plants were uprooted. “This morning it is with a heavy heart that I join the understandably frustrated members of the PTA of the Reform Hindu School as yet again we are clamouring for the Government to complete the new Reform Hindu School which was started under the PP (People’s Partnership) government and abandoned by this Government,” he said. The new school was 95 per cent completed when the People’s National Movement (PNM) was elected to office in 2015, Hosein said. Hosein said pupils were currently cramped in small classrooms located on the compound of the Reform Shiva Mandir. He said it is clear the Government had no interest in looking after the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago “as our children continue to suffer”. Parents have held numerous protests in recent years. “After several protests and attempts of reaching out to the Minister of Education with nothing but broken promises, I am now calling on the Prime Minister to adjust his priorities and demand that the Reform Hindu School be completed and opened,” he said. And should no action be taken, Hosein said, parents were prepared to take further protest action. Minister in the Ministry of Education Dr Lovell Francis said he was not aware of the discovery. Francis was unable to confirm whether a security guard was stationed at the school. In a text message to the Express, Francis said, “Thanks for the update.

The three men were released by Justice Devan Rampersad at the Hall of Justice in Port of Spain this afternoon, after another judge ruled in a judicial review claim that the decision of the DPP’s Office to continue prosecuting them was unfair, unreasonable and improper. Those freed were: Chris Durham, Deon Calliste and Ian Salandy. They were accused of murdering Khenti Murai, Mubarak Calder and Kevon St Louis in April 2009. Last week, a team of attorneys representing the men, filed a claim for judicial review to have the indictments quashed after the prosecution disclosed to them that the State’s main witness had confessed he fabricated evidence against the men at the Magistrates’ Court and had the intention of again doing so when the matter goes to trial at the High Court. But in spite of this, the DPP’s Office decided it was moving ahead with the prosecution. At the San Fernando High Court this morning, Justice Avason Quinlan-Williams, who presided over the judicial review claim, ruled in favour of the men and quashed the indictments, clearing the way for them to be released.

A day in celebration of love and Commitment. Well a couple from our Central Kitchen really displayed these two pillars on their wedding day. In the planning stages of their wedding, they really wanted to include the distribution of meals to our Hungry on the Streets as part of their Special Day. However, it never seemed to pan out whether or not it would be disrespectful to the guests in attendance. It’s said that a dream is a wish your heart makes and this definitely had to a be a dream come true because what their heart wished for, it came to reality. Things just fell into place. It had to be some sort of Divine Intervention at play. Kudos to Crystal & Mike for their continued support to our Central Kitchen in being part of this Offering of Love, To Love, From Love and coincidentally on a day celebrating love. Last but not least, congrats to you both on your special day and may you be blessed to continue on this path of love & service”. In a telephone interview with Express on Monday, Thong-Kiaw said he and his bride held a small wedding and there was a surplus of food after the 70 guests had eaten and given take away boxes. “There was so much food and soup remaining and I hate to see food spoil and waste. We decided to go on the usual route where we would hand out the meals. It was after 12 in the night and the food finished in no time”, said Thong-Kiaw. “We enjoy helping people and we didn’t want to give anyone the task of giving out the food. It was our wedding and our food, so why not”. “The people receiving the food told my wife she looked so beautiful. They know us, but we just looked a little different”, the groom laughed. Thong-Kiaw said that he and his wife feel uplifted through their volunteer work. “The people are so grateful, so nice and many are very talented. I have no idea why people shun them. It is amazing as to how people treat them. When you build a relationship with them, and talk to them you realise that they are regular people who were trying to make an honest dollar but life dealt them some bad cards. Many of them do not even have a criminal record. Some made some bad choices, and some were not able to handle things too well and found themselves on the street”, he said. “Over the past year we saw how much these meals mean to them (street dwellers). They are so happy to know that people still care and people are willing to help them in whatever form or fashion. We didn’t know they were taking the photos, but if they help to inspire others to participate in helping that made it worthwhile”, said the groom.

I have found it interesting recently that the “big parties” seem to be following the smaller ones. For example, the Prime Minister’s recent comments concerning events surrounding the spate of decisions on the Freedom of Information Act are instructive. He is quoted as saying that “there should be more transparency regarding information to the public.” He is basically echoing the sentiments expressed by the political leader of the Congress of the People (COP) who called for certain Cabinet notes to be made public. It is interesting that after four years of secrecy regarding the closing of Petrotrin, the failed Sandals project, the Dragon Field deal and many others, the Prime Minister conveniently considers this a possibility. This is a little too late, Mr Prime Minister. In spite of your party’s bravado, it is unlikely the country will realise the reform you promised. The only parties that seem genuine about the governance issues seem to be the smaller ones. After the relaunch of the COP, the political leader asked for the parties to declare their unexplained wealth, and the Minister of Communication soon after declared that campaign finance reform will be tabled. To date, no such bill has been laid. Instead, the whistle-blower legislation failed. Transparency in governance remains an elusive dream under both major parties. The COP is also leading the opposition as well; the Opposition Leader on a radio programme spoke to the issue of climate change. It is instructive to note that the COP was the first party to declare that it would introduce a national sustainable development master plan which is apolitical and an act of Parliament which focuses on the social, economic and environmental issues. The party has declared that it has recognised the frequency of disasters and that the time has come for climate change to be a main focus of concern and be part of the economic indicators going forward. The Opposition Leader has now also come out with some sort of economic transformational master plan. With the recently formed Patriotic Front along with the Movement for Social Justice, the message of good governance and constitutional change seems front and centre while the major parties, funded by big business, avoid the issue altogether or, at the very least, pay lip service to these ideals. The COP has been the only party to declare a policy on party financing. It may be unto something here. It might just make sense to take a closer look, after all it seems to be emerging as the template that all others are following. Maybe it is time for the people to have their voices heard through this party. Maybe it is time to stand up to those big anonymous business interests that have been pulling the strings of governments past and present to the detriment of the citizens at large. Lastly, the COP has been having discussions about decentralisation via e-government services and shorter working hours and I have noticed that some of the chambers, inclusive of the American Chamber, are now hosting forum discussions on this too. I for one am looking and listening more carefully and will no longer be hoodwinked by smooth talk and empty promises.

They arrived half an hour after the Raj Sonnylal was brought ashore. A police report said that Sonnylal, 29, of Penal, was bathing with relatives in the bay when around 11.15 a.m. when they got into difficulties. His relatives made it out the water, but noticed that Sonnylal was not with them. Relatives went looking for lifeguards, but were told that they were engaged in strike action. One of Sonnylal’s relatives sought help from the Maracas police station, and returned with two officers. Sonnylal was seen floating near the shoreline around 11.35 a.m. and pulled out from the water. A team from the US Marines, including Dr Buffong, began cardio pulmonary resuscitation on Sonnylal, assisted by lifeguards of the las Cuevas lifeguard station. An Emergency Health Services ambulance took Sonnylal to the Port of Spain General Hospital where doctors attended to him. He is warded on the Intensive Care Unit. National Union of Government and Federated Workers (NUGFW) representative for the lifeguards Augustus Sylvester told Express that there are numerous health and safety issues at the facilities at the lifeguard quarters at Maracas, and lifeguards have opted to stay away. Sylvester said that under the current PNM administration, the lifeguard division was moved from the charge of the Ministry of Tourism, to the Ministry of National Security. Sylvester said that among the health and safety issues were the dead rats and bat droppings in the building, malfunctioning toilets, with one of them clogged and sewage flooding the toilet area, faulty water pump, and no air conditioning. The lifeguards, who are scheduled to work from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. instead sign the register, stay a few hours on the job and leave, Sylvester said. “The issues that were raised with the ministry of national security for some time now and no attempts have been made to deal with these issues. It is unsafe for the workers to operate from that building. For the last three weeks the lifeguards are going to sign the book and remain a short while then depart from the building”, said Sylvester. “Unfortunately there is a guy right now who is fighting for his life at hospital because there were no lifeguards on duty. Someone saw the incident and called one of the lifeguards in the area, and that is how the lifeguards from Las Cuevas responded. I was told that the man washed ashore and foreign military persons came and were doing CPR on him. The lifeguards from Las Cuevas came and operated on him until they took him to the hospital”, he said. “The ministry is not doing anything to settle these issues.

Taken to police station: A member of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, right, assists in the loading of items belonging to some Venezuelan migrants who were found in a camp in Santa Flora. BOATLOADS of Venezuelans continue to arrive in Trinidad seeking the chance to be registered, says Cedros councillor Shankar Teelucksingh. According to Teelucksingh, as soon as the boats dock along the various illegal ports of entry on Trinidad’s south western peninsula, migrants are being transported by buses to the San Fernando registration centre to be processed. Speaking to the Express yesterday, Teelucksingh said with the Cedros Security Complex no longer processing ferries transporting Venezuelans at the port, the desperate foreign nationals fleeing their homeland are arriving in large numbers hoping for the opportunity to be registered. The nearest centre for Venezuelans coming from south is at Achievors Banquet Hall in San Fernando. The registration process began on May 31 and will continue until June 14. The other centres are at Queen’s Park Oval in Port of Spain and at the Caroline Building in Tobago. “The port in Cedros remains closed for ferries being Venezuelans legally into Trinidad while the other illegal ports of entry remain open. There are no checks and balances from the authorities to stop these vessels coming to Icacos, Chatham, Bamboo Beach, St Ann’s Beach, the Granville Beach, Santa Flora, Erin and those areas remain open for the illegal Venezuelans. More and more Venezuelans are coming in by the boatloads throughout and the authorities are turning a blind eye,” he said. Teelucksingh said over the weekend police intercepted a 25-seater maxi taxi carrying the newly arrived Venezuelan nationals and when taken to the nearest Immigration office, he said the officials gave the Venezuelans the registration forms. There were approximately 150 Venezuelans who entered the country over the weekend, said Teelucksingh. He said: “What happened over the weekend was the police intercepted the maxi-taxi, took them down to Immigration and what happened next was Immigration just gave them these migrants the forms to go and get the work permit. And it is encouraging more of these illegals migrants to come in.” Teelucksingh said the entire system of monitoring the Venezuelans entering the country has gone unchecked and has reached a point where it is now uncontrolled. “Nobody is trying to put a stop to who is coming in or turning them back, or if there is a cut-off point. We are not hearing anything from the Ministry of National Security or Labour. Right now the whole system is unchecked and uncontrolled because of the amount of people coming in now from the South West peninsula,” he said. Teelucksingh expressed concern that there would be significant job loss for his constituents with the number of Venezuelans arriving. He said medications is already difficult for residents to collect. “For the average citizen who seek employment now have to compete with the Venezuelans and the Minister of Labour needs to break her silence on this. I continue to say that there should be an assessment done with the shortfall of labour in Trinidad and Tobago in those sectors we need to import example the medical department. In the South West peninsula we are seeing a shortage of residents getting medication. The Minister of Health continue to hoodwink the population saying that we have enough to deal with any crisis that should come up at the hospitals. The health centres don’t have the basic medications people need and we need help,” he said. Speaking during a visit to the Port of Spain registration office on Thursday, National Security Minister Stuart Young said the Ministry has increased its resources regarding patrols along the borders. “Over the past month or so, we had increased the number of assets, the available assets down in the maritime borders of Trinidad and Tobago both down in the South as well as up in the north. I don’t want to get into the operational side so then persons would know what we are trying to do and then they may try to avoid it. What I can tell is that we are utilising as much of the asserts that we have as possible that including our radar system, all of our boats and vessels, the Venezuelan authorities themselves have also stepped up on their side of the border with their patrols as well. The port of Cedros, never didn’t open, but at the end of the day you have to understand from the national Security point of view our priority is to secure Trinidad and Tobago and our citizens of Trinidad and Tobago. So when there are patrols going out there, they will continue to do what it is they are doing, he said. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley announced on Thursday that his Cabinet took a decision to exempt migrants from paying NIS. He added that the Government will not give an extension for registration of Venezuelans.

The lifeguards, who are scheduled to work from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. instead sign the register, stay a few hours on the job and leave, Sylvester said. “The issues that were raised with the ministry of national security for some time now and no attempts have been made to deal with these issues. It is unsafe for the workers to operate from that building. For the last three weeks the lifeguards are going to sign the book and remain a short while then depart from the building”, said Sylvester. “Unfortunately there is a guy right now who is fighting for his life at hospital because there were no lifeguards on duty. Someone saw the incident and called one of the lifeguards in the area, and that is how the lifeguards from Las Cuevas responded. I was told that the man washed ashore and foreign military persons came and were doing CPR on him. The lifeguards from Las Cuevas came and operated on him until they took him to the hospital”, he said. “The ministry is not doing anything to settle these issues. These issues are reported almost on a daily basis to the ministry. The workers think that the only option that they have to secure themselves is to stay away”, said Sylvester.

Unsafe food also hinders development in many low- and middle-income economies, which lose around US$95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability, and premature death suffered by workers.

HAVE you ever felt that after years spent waiting and hoping to meet someone special, everyone seems to be finding love except you? “Hey mister, is this the way to Castara?” I was driving a rental car in Tobago en route hopefully to the beautiful scenic rural fishing village of Castara. A seaside spot on the leeward coast of Tobago, Castara’s economy is dependent primarily on fishing and agriculture, with tourism playing an increasingly important role since the 1990s. Times are hard and for many there seems no respite on the horizon. Trinidadians, however, still deserve to enjoy life as best they can and to also celebrate special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and more. Of course with the present state of the economy, it is difficult to host lavish events. To say Christiania is an unusual place would be a huge understatement. The small village, about 19 acres in size, is located in the heart of the Danish capital of Copenhagen. It is home to about 1,000 people who choose to live outside societal norms and structure.

The fact one of them is play­ing for Eng­land makes it more in­trigu­ing. Bar­ba­dos-born Jofra Archer was a late in­clu­sion in Eng­land''s squad af­ter qual­i­fy­ing on res­i­den­cy in March. West In­dies coach Floyd Reifer said Archer "made his choice." Now he''s go­ing to have to live with it. The 24-year-old Archer is set to lead the Eng­land at­tack against the West In­dies on Fri­day, a show­down that will be in the spot­light. Archer was the toast of Lon­don af­ter tak­ing three wick­ets against South Africa in Eng­land''s tour­na­ment-open­ing win, and has six wick­ets so far at the World Cup. The West In­dies have had plen­ty of choice in the pace de­part­ment, with skip­per Ja­son Hold­er work­ing with Shel­don Cot­trell, An­dre Rus­sell, Os­hane Thomas and Car­los Brath­waite to bounce out Pak­istan for 105 and then cause de­fend­ing cham­pi­on Aus­tralia all kinds of trou­ble ear­ly be­fore slip­ping to a 15-run loss. Cot­trell took two ear­ly wick­ets to have South Africa reel­ing at 29-2 on Mon­day be­fore rain washed out the group game at Hamp­shire''s Rose Bowl. The Windies will take a 1-1-1 record back to Hamp­shire on Fri­day to face Eng­land, which has two wins and a loss. While Archer has been a rev­e­la­tion to oc­ca­sion­al crick­et fans in Eng­land, he has long been on the watch list for se­lec­tors be­cause of his Eng­lish-born fa­ther. He was well known in the Caribbean as a Bar­ba­dos Un­der-19 rep­re­sen­ta­tive be­fore de­cid­ing to see if his British pass­port was a way to reach the in­ter­na­tion­al lev­el. "To be hon­est, we knew Jofra for a long time. He is from Bar­ba­dos," said Reifer, who played crick­et against a younger Archer in Bar­ba­dos. "Yes, he''s bowl­ing quick­ly, but there''s noth­ing that we are not ac­cus­tomed to." Eng­land has nev­er won the Crick­et World Cup, but is the No. 1-ranked team and was pre-tour­na­ment fa­vorite to win on home soil. The West In­dies were the orig­i­nal kings of one-day crick­et, win­ning the first two World Cups and reach­ing the fi­nal in 1983. They haven''t been back to the fi­nal since. Reifer not­ed that Archer had some in­juries as a young, de­vel­op­ing pace man learn­ing the craft but al­ways showed he had the tal­ent to play in­ter­na­tion­al crick­et. "Def­i­nite­ly. He ob­vi­ous­ly had the pace. He had a few in­juries as a young guy. But I''m guess­ing though he''s ful­ly over those in­juries and he is bowl­ing very well for Eng­land," Reifer said. "I''m sure Jofra will be chomp­ing at the bit to come at us, and we will be ready for him. "Jofra is a tremen­dous tal­ent, we all know that. Like I said, we are look­ing for­ward to the game on Fri­day." ', 4),

Finance Minister Colm Imbert FORMER Central Bank governor Jwala Rambarran says it has now been proven that Finance Minister Colm Imbert’s “petty and irrational vendetta” against him was reason why an offer of employment that was extended to him with the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G-24), was withdrawn in 2016. Rambarran said Imbert directly intervened and prevented him from being appointed as a senior advisor with the G-24 secretariat, a position for which he had applied and was offered following his dismissal as governor of the Central Bank the previous year. Two weeks ago, High Court judge Justice Frank Seepersad ordered that Imbert disclose any correspondence he sent to Marilou Uy, director of the G-24 Secretariat, as it pertains to Rambarran prior to the offer to him being withdrawn. Rambarran had filed a lawsuit against Imbert after the minister initially refused to disclose the correspondence even though Rambarran had made a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Justice Seepersad, in delivering his ruling in favour of Rambarran, gave Imbert seven days in which to disclose the information. That information was disclosed one week ago. In a release issued on Sunday, Rambarran said the disclosure showed that Imbert “intervened and interfered in the recruitment process to prevent me from assuming the prestigious position of Senior Advisor to the G-24 Secretariat.” He stated, the correspondence showed that Uy had informed the minister that he (Rambarran) was unanimously selected as the highest ranked and most suitable candidate for the position that he had applied. Former Central Bank Governor Jwala Rambarran “Director Marilou Uy emphasized that this was a technical appointment with the G-24 Secretariat, not a political one representing the interests of any government, including Trinidad and Tobago. However, the offer for the position to which I had applied, interviewed and was accepted was rescinded on 29th December 2016 after Mr. Imbert’s intervention which included a telephone call to the Director. “Imbert’s pettiness and political blinders prevented me as a private citizen from working for a respected international institution in a capacity that would have been very beneficial to the international image of Trinidad and Tobago at a time when his mishandling of the economy requires maximum external support from experts with the proper training and expertise,” he stated. Rambarran went further to say that his “unceremonious dismissal” as Central Bank governor was not enough for Imbert, since the minister felt compelled “to complete my personal destruction by ensuring that I remain unemployed, even if I was the best candidate for the job and could do my country proud at an international level.” “Incidentally while Minister Imbert preoccupies himself playing piddly games with me instead of trying to revive our failing and battered economy, I will not. I could have issued contempt of court proceedings against Mr. Imbert as he provided these documents in two sets, one within the deadline fixed by the Court and one outside the deadline. “But I will not make a fuss about the missed deadline and jump at the chance to have him in contempt. That’s the sort of petty manoeuvre I’ll leave for the Minister, after all he needs all the help he can get, given his failures at not only trying to destroy me but also as a Minister of Finance,” Rambarran stated.

Venezuelans outside the Queens Park Oval registration centre in Port of Spain on Sunday. https://bit.ly/2MEjOdR The Government’s registration programme for Venezuelan migrants has been welcomed by that country’s ambassador to Trinidad and ­Tobago, ­Carlos Perez, who said yesterday the embassy has not interfered in the ­process so far. Speaking to I95 FM, Perez praised the State’s move to regularise some of those fleeing the troubled Latin Ameri­can neighbour amid economic and ­political turmoil, saying the programme gave them a chance to work while ­being protected by the State. Venezuelans lined up in the rain outside the Achievor''s Banquet Hall registration centre in San Fernando on Sunday. Photo: TREVOR WATSON While stating the decision to leave Venezuela was “a personal one”, Perez also left some questions—such as whether a cap should be placed on the ­number of migrants allowed into T&T—up to the Government. “It’s a very good initiative from the Government of T&T,” Perez told the radio station. He noted the process, which began on May 31 and ends on Friday, allows migrants and those claiming refugee status to regularise their status and seek gainful employment for up to a year, while under the protection of the law. Further, those successful in the registration process will likely be able to apply for T&T citizenship or obtain a work permit. Asked whether the T&T Government should place a cap on the number of migrants allowed into T&T, Perez said: “That answer should come from the Government of Trinidad and ­Tobago.” Perez said migration was a personal decision, and was not within the control of any government. “At the end of the day, when you migrate, it’s a personal decision,” he said. Perez was also asked to address Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar’s stated support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who in January declared himself interim presi­dent and called for President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “The only thing I can say is there is only one president in Venezuela and that is Nicolas Maduro,” Perez stated. However, as he represents the government of Venezuela, Perez said he is able to “sit” with anyone in T&T “without a problem”. The ambassador said he would be open to meeting with Persad-Bissessar. He went on to state his support for the position of “non-intervention” into Venezuela’s sovereign affairs adopted by the T&T Government and Caricom. No interference While he has not visited any of the Government’s three registration centres in Port of Spain, San Fernando and Scarborough, Perez said the embassy has noted the process is an internal one, but is being monitored by the embassy. Free food was shared at the Achievor''s Banquet Hall registration centre in San Fernando on Sunday. Photo: TREVOR WATSON “We don’t want to create any disruption,” he said, adding, “We will see. Maybe you will see me around sometime before the process ends.” Perez, who arrived here on May 31, was hopeful the Montevideo mechanism, established between Caricom and the governments of Mexico and Uruguay, would eventually lead to a peaceful resolution for his country. “To me, it’s like the light at the end of the tunnel of this process,” he said. He said social media content in Venezuela has also shown that Guaidó does not have total support within the opposition, and that there are “dissenting voices”. As for reports of police and military brutality against protesting citizens in Venezuela, Perez said police officers and soldiers who used excessive force against citizens during protests have been jailed, pending investigations. Saying only the Venezuelan ­people could decide their president—either in the next presidential election or through a referendum—Perez said efforts to oust Maduro were tied to attempts to take control of that country’s vast natural resources. He said the Venezuelan constitution provided all the mechanisms needed for the Venezuelan people to make that decision, and chided that United States sanctions on his country were ­worsening an already difficult situation.
