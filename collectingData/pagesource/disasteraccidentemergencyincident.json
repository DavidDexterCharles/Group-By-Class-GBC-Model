Fire broke out at the substation on January 22, plunging a wide area in west Trinidad into darkness. T&TEC's general manager, Kelvin Ramsook, has dismissed claims that the State enterprise was forewarned about the potential disaster. Sources, however, told the Sunday Express that only three weeks ago, the commission held a joint Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) meeting with representatives of the OWTU and the issue of poor maintenance of the substation and the potential danger it posed was brought to the forefront. The union's branch representative, Peter Burke, yesterday confirmed to the Sunday Express that the meeting took place. Burke said arrangements were not made to have the substation maintained in a timely manner. \\\"The transmission division is undermanned and no provisions are being put in place to ensure the substations are properly maintained. The accident was waiting to happen. Proper measures are not being put in place,\\\" Burke said. Burke said the matter relating to the Westmoorings substation was brought to the attention of T&TEC but noting was done to prevent the fire from occurring. \\\"For sometime, we have been complaining to T&TEC but they continue to turn a blind eye to HSE matters and now there is a problem with operational and maintenance matters. \\\"The issue here is that a fundamental piece of equipment as a transformer was not being maintained properly. \\\"The fire was absolutely avoidable. The management of T&TEC was warned about the fire hazard,\\\" Burke said. The substation, the Sunday Express learned, is equipped with two 66/32 kilovolt (KV) transformers to feed electricity to Westmoorings, Diego Martin, Glencoe, Petit Valley, Cocorite and surrounding areas. However, the Sunday Express was told by sources that due to poor maintenance one of the transformers caught fire. The Sunday Express learned that on September 29 an oil circuit breaker dielectric test and a polarisation index were conducted at the substation by T&TEC officials. A transmission maintenance check, the Sunday Express learned, was also conducted and it was found the substation was not equipped with the following: \\u2022 Tap changer boucholz relay \\u2022 High voltage bushings \\u2022 Neutral bushings \\u2022 Tap changer compartment \\u2022 Oil level in tap changer conservator was inadequate \\u2022 Three fans were missing While the test results were normal, the Sunday Express learned due to the leakage of oil from the transformer in the presence of a defective bushing the oil ignited. \\\"The fire was a disaster waiting to happen. The substation was not being maintained. Six fans are needed for the substation and only three are working. The management of T&TEC knew about the problems at the Westmoorings substation and nothing was done,\\\" said Burke. In spite of the findings of the transmission maintenance check last September, Ramsook is insisting T&TEC was not warned. \\\"We did a preliminary report and the finding was that the fire was caused by a failure of a bushing on the transformer. An investigative committee is continuing investigations,\\\" Ramsook said. Asked if T&TEC was warned beforehand about the fire hazard at the substation, Ramsook said: \\\"T&TEC got no warning about the substation. T&TEC has a clear plan to upgrade the substation. We applied to the Port of Spain City Corporation to get land to upgrade the substation. We have a plan. \\\"Two months ago the corporation agreed to sell us a parcel of land for $8 million to upgrade the Westmoorings substation. T&TEC have asked the corporation if it is possible if the cost could be reduced. We did not get any special privilege, we went through the normal process.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

To tell us that they have the \\\"ability to respond,'' falls into the category of what is often referred to as \\\"talking loud and saying nothing.'' For example, the fire department, whom he praises as having being \\\"trained by international organisations,'' responds to every fire in this country. Yet in fairness to them, 99 per cent of the cases to which they respond \\\"the structure has already been gutted''. And we have been noticing a lot of that in recent months. Perhaps their international training corresponds to their new mandate, which seems to be hosing down roads after accidents. Almost forgot, they also seem to have been trained in water-delivery for friends and colleagues. And in the rare situations when they do have water, the hoses act more like sprinklers, with little of the precious commodity dousing the fire; much being wasted long before getting hitting its target. This same department, it must be also noted, is quite meticulous in the upkeep of their million-dollar bus and SUVs. The colonel also went on to say that the regiment is also ready. That must be a joke. Where are they located One wave would make them irrelevant, as their one road in and out can disappear. Haiti made it abundantly clear to the rest of the world the need to \\\"be prepared,'' in the motto of the Boy Scouts. It is must be noted that never did the colonel say \\\"we are prepared to deal with a disaster.\\\" The colonel merely said we are ready to respond, a significant difference, and one worth noting. Evidently, he is aware that we are unprepared to deal with any disaster. Everyone knows this. Five minutes of rain in PoS and flood, mud and transport nightmare. We don't even have a simple evacuation plan. What is amazing is that for years Colm Imbert has been preparing an evacuation plan. A draft was submitted on July 21, 2005. When criticised about it, Mr Imbert sought to shoot the messenger; typical Imbertian logic. A couple years ago when a minor earthquake shook PoS, it took me over three hours to get from PoS to Pashley Street, Laventille. So much for an evacuation plan! Of course Imbert had to have the last say. So let me quote him directly. He wrote: \\\"The plan involves a great deal more than the creation of additional lanes on roads leading out of the city it focuses on policing, inter-agency collaboration, dissemination of information, use of public and private transportation, arrangements for public assembly, telecommunications, aerial surveillance, monitoring and decision-making, among many other things. The plan is now being finalised in consultation with stakeholders and interest groups and the final version should be available within the next month.' (Colm Imbert, Express, July 27, 2005). Someone needs to tell Colm that we are into 2K10, and still without a simple thing like an evacuation plan. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, it is insulting for some retired colonel to come today because of the tragedy in Haiti and try to mamaguy citizens of this republic. We'd be much better off as a people if we take advice from Colonel Sanders than that of the ODPM.

IN one of the many striking scenes in HBO\\u2019s hit series Chernobyl, frustrated Soviet state apparatchik, Boris Scherbina, is desperately attempting to explain to his superiors in Moscow, via telephone how grave the disaster has been at Chernobyl. Realising that nothing he is saying is making a difference, he loses his temper, begins insulting his superiors and proceeds to smash the telephone to pieces. Walking outside to greet his comrades, Scherbina regains some composure and then wryly informs them, \\u201cthe official position of the state is that global nuclear catastrophe is not possible in the Soviet Union.\\u201d This one scene captures what the Chernobyl catastrophe was all about and perhaps illustrates what it\\u2019s like working as an economist for Finance Minister Colm Imbert. Chernobyl is a lesson in what occurs when authoritarian regimes naturally become so disconnected from the truth that they believe they can bend reality to suit their narrative. Trinidad and Tobago may not have nuclear power plants or uranium, but we do enrich a substance that is far more dangerous\\u2014incompetent public officials. I hope Prime Minister Keith Rowley sees Chernobyl because it may help him realise his own Government appears to be in complete meltdown. Despite the seabridge collapse, the fake oil scandal, the failed Sandals resort deal, the failed Dragon Gas deal, the Attorney General\\u2019s State rental deal, the failure to address the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, to the recent attempt to muzzle the Freedom of Information Act and more, Dr Rowley wants us all to believe that his Government is functioning normally and to disregard the fact that he and his ministers are emitting a vibrant green glow. Of course all governments lie and spin the truth to suit their interests. That\\u2019s as normal as the sunrise or a daylight shoot-out in Port of Spain. But when governments, driven by their own narcissism, don\\u2019t simply lie but believe that they themselves can\\u2019t possibly be capable of mistakes, that\\u2019s where things start to become radioactive. Officials in the former USSR waited an entire 24 hours to even accept that the reactor at Chernobyl had exploded and a full 36 hours to issue an evacuation order to the neighbouring town, which in their defence, is still more than the ODPM did during the floods last year. The failure of Moscow to initially accept the scale of the disaster is somewhat similar to our own Government refusing to accept that for the past four years we have been in the eye of a huge refugee storm. Hence they never crafted a proper policy other than National Security Minister Stuart Young having to stand outside the Oval and scream at crowds of refugees through a bullhorn. In the case of the USSR, they didn\\u2019t want to admit technological inferiority to the United States. In the case of Dr Rowley, he didn\\u2019t want to stop receiving conga line dance invitations from Caracas. And of course Dragon Gas. Another area where Dr Rowley\\u2019s Government exhibits an uncanny resemblance to the former overlords of the Soviet states is the general attitude both display to professionals in their fields. In another great scene in Chernobyl, when scientist Ulana Khomyuk presents the full horror that is unfolding near the reactor, she is rebuffed by a party official with the words: \\u201cI prefer my opinion to yours.\\u201d Well at least he didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t come here for any sterile and academic debate\\u201d. You would expect the Prime Minister to attempt to delegitimise the credibility of the Opposition in their critiques of his policy. But it hasn\\u2019t stopped there. Tobagonians who complained about the seabridge were accused of \\u201cbad talking Tobago\\u201d, environmentalists against the shady Sandals Resort deal were dismissed as \\u201csaboteurs\\u201d, and economists who question the Government\\u2019s continued excessive borrowing were told they were \\u201cnaysayers\\u201d. For Dr Rowley the only people qualified to express an opinion on his policies are those who attended the University of Balisier House. In 2006, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev described what still remains as the worst nuclear accident in history as a \\u201cturning point\\u201d for the USSR. \\u201c(Chernobyl) opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue,\\u201d wrote Gorbachev. Chernobyl\\u2019s deadly radiation didn\\u2019t just kill thousands of people, it also weakened the propaganda reality the Soviet state had maintained with an iron grip for decades. Similarly as the Government looks to pass amendments, adding red tape to the Freedom of Information Act, Dr Rowley may find that the public has little taste for the secretive authoritarian politics of old. Just like the apparatchiks at Chernobyl, the Prime Minister may dismiss his Government\\u2019s blunders as no big deal, but he is likely ignoring a chain reaction he can\\u2019t now stop. \\u2014 Darryn Boodan is a freelance writer IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

That thousands of Trinidadians would knowingly subject themselves to torture, just to see other equally stupid Trinis \\\"pilot\\\" some crude \\\"craft\\\" that plunges into the sea in seconds, speaks volumes about our collective stupidity. I imagine that those who found the event so attractive would point to the sponsors' other \\\"flugtags\\\" having attracted even bigger crowds in countries as diverse as Austria, Britain, the US and Brazil. True. But are they suggesting that because stupidity is the lowest common denominator among fans of this stupid event, we too must bray because other donkey people do For the uninitiated, meaning all the smart people who stayed far from the madness in Chaguaramas, \\\"flugtag\\\" is an event owned and operated by the so-called energy drink, Red Bull. Competitors attempt to fly homemade, human-powered \\\"flying machines\\\" launched high off a pier or platform into the sea or a lake. Most crash as they leave the launch pad. Momentum takes a few beyond ground zero, and the \\\"record\\\" is said to be 200 feet. Red Bull is a caffeine-and-sugar-laden concoction that is banned in several countries (Norway, Uruguay, Denmark, France, Korea and Germany, to name a few) because of health concerns. France was forced to lift the ban in 2008 (EU trade rules), but Red Bull had to exclude the ingredient \\\"taurine\\\" from drinks sold in that country. Owner Dietrich Mateschitz is not worried, though: last year his company sold 3.5 billion cans of \\\"bull\\\" in 143 countries, making him a very wealthy man. But back to the \\\"bull\\\" that had thousands of donkeys trapped in hours-long traffic, and residents of districts in the west trapped in their homes most of last Sunday. Most officials in authoritythe police, the regional corporation, the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM), fire officers, Defence Forceclaimed they were not informed of the staging of the event. I don't know if they expected invitations. I was informed. Hell, anybody who stays tuned to the media could hardly have missed the massive advertising campaign mounted by the event's organisers and sponsors. The moment I learned of it, I warned all who cared to listen to stay clear of the West that day. At the time, I had forgotten about St Peter's Day and Carenage, which is another traffic-horror-story that I fell victim to many years ago. For me, that was a punitive lesson in car-crawling that I never forgotand never subjected myself to again. But this is a free country, too free, I should add, and people can choose to engage in masochism, self-flagellation, death-wish, whatever, as they deem fit. When, however, their collective stupidity impinges on the lives and safety of others, that's where the responsibility of those in authority comes into play. In this instance, residents from St James, Diego Martin and its environs, and those from Westmoorings all the way to Carenage, became hostages in their own homes. The first agency that must have known about the event is the CDA. They would have had to grant permission to the organisers to erect platforms and other installations, and allocate them parking space. In the wake of the disaster that ensued, CDA Chairman Daniel Solomon boldly proclaimed the event a resounding success. I think this fella needs to have his head examined. He certainly is not Solomon the Wise. How could the police not know when, days before, they issued a traffic order that there would be no parking or stopping on the Western Main Road between Glencoe and Chaguaramas How could the chairman of the regional corporation claim or feign ignorance after the fiasco And while the Defence Force camps are more widely dispersed today than they were decades ago, the soldiers and coastguardsmen stationed in Chaguaramas were severely compromised by the gridlock that rendered the entire west a \\\"no go\\\" zone for all of last Sunday. As for those over-eager patrons who chose to \\\"beat the heat\\\" by boarding fishing pirogues, what can I say I heard one victim complain about the vessels not having insurance or life vests. Is she from Mars From what I know, fishing pirogues do not cater for passengers, so they are not obligated to have insurance. Indeed, if they do have life vests, these are only for the limited crews that man the vessels. I sympathise with the families who suffered losses, especially those two young boys who drowned in their families' desperate bid to reach the venue. They ought to have known better. But I guess when there is a madness to gladness, anything can happen. In this case, two boys paid the price with their lives. And the country moves on. Bear in mind this massive gridlock came mere days after a traffic accident in Gasparillo paralysed one-third of the country. Those in authority also seem to be paralysedstricken by their inability to forecast crises like the \\\"flugtag mayhem\\\", grounded by their impotence to deal with them when they occur. And in the aftermath, they remain confident that the population would soon forget the fiasco as another one arises to capture our attention. We move from crisis to crisis, most of them man-made, with consummate ease. Jah help us should nature decide to deal us a disastrous blow.

The residents were affected by last weeks oil spill, and have protested several times, demanding that State-owned Petrotrin provide proper health care, medication, relocation and compensation. Some residents wanted to know yesterday why it took McLeod a week to show up, and one warned McLeod to choose his words carefully as he sought to explain his position on whether people should be relocated. Last Tuesday, slop oil (a combination of oil, water and sediment) from a holding tank on Petrotrins refinery compound flowed into the river, sickening dozens of people and leading to an evacuation of some, who have been temporarily relocated to a guest house in the area. McLeod, who was accompanied by Energy Minister Kevin Ramnarine, Petrotrin president Khalid Hassanali, and company doctor David Jackson, met with residents at Silk Cotton Road, Battoo Avenue. He told residents there were associated risks with living close to the refinery and that residents living in a disaster zone have had to co-exist with the refinery for years. He said relocating residents to less risky areas would require a great period of time and planning. McLeod said, For years we have co-existed with the refinery and one would expect that over the years, one would have learnt from the past, and put in place the kind of measures that would make the place as safe as possible. McLeod said his approach to such accidents in the industry is to investigate the cause before anyone points fingers. In an attempt to explain why he was only now visiting residents, McLeod said, I would not have come here and join in an issue before I understood Petrotrins response to what happened. I establish that you could not immediately deal with the issue (as) it had to happen over a period of time (and) it takes collaborative efforts. Residents were upset with his response with some saying, Whole week we look for you.

Are the workers and plant fully insured In every single case where this question was asked the answer was in the affirmative, that indeed T&TEC was fully insured.\\\" The Express articles raised questions about the failure of T&TEC to award an insurance brokerage contract, after an aborted first tender left the Commission scrambling for emergency cover nine days before its insurance portfolio was due to expire last June 30. Burke said the article confirmed further breaches of the procurement policy at T&TEC and insisted that the trade union be allowed to examine the policies safeguarding plant and workforce. \\\"Clearly, some of the responses, the excuses, seem to confirm further breaches of T&TEC procurement policy. There seems to be a lack of understanding of the procurement and seems to be some unseen hand in this process that would have driven T&TEC to operate in the way it has, putting its plant and workforce at risk. \\\"We want to examine the policies, we feel there is a lot of things the Commission is trying to hide from us,\\\" he said. Speaking at a press conference held yesterday at the union's Paramount Building headquarters in San Fernando, Burke said management would have only realised how reckless their actions were (with only 30 per cent coverage) if there was an unforeseen disaster. \\\"It would have affected everybody because the State would have had to find billions of dollars to replace plant and equipment when there should have been an insurance in place to take care of any eventuality,\\\" he said. Burke advised shareholders in T&TEC to take action, and that management provide answers to workers. He asked that the company provide information on the state of the insurance today, whether the commission was now completely covered, who is the broker, and why management did not tell workers the truth on the first working day in July. Burke said any management that takes risk with a utility's insurance for any period of time should not be allowed to continue. He said, \\\"The norm in the industry is if you want an extension to change supplier you will allow the incumbent to continue and maintain coverage for the period of time you determine fit ... but that was not done.\\\" Burke questioned the expertise of the second committee established to go through the procurement process. He accused the committee of securing the cheapest bid, without considering the quality of service. \\\"It is not only looking at the cheapest bid because there has to be a quality of cover which meets the requirements of a power electricity. And if it is that you can get less than adequate cover it will be cheaper, so when you doing brokerage contracts you have not only to look at cost but expertise of broker and quality of the cover. And that was ignored in this case,\\\" he said. Burke said within a year, five T&TEC workers died on duty, four members of the public were electrocuted and there were countless accidents in the workplace.

State oil and gas giant Petrotrin knows this better than most. It has recorded serious safety and production incidents and as many deaths over the last decade. Yet, despite these costly and tragic outcomes to its cavalier disregard for safety, Petrotrin has failed to rein in the culture of risk or heed the warnings of its own technical experts or recommendations contained in numerous internal accident reports, including workplace fatalities, Sunday Express investigations have revealed. Accident reports, maintenance records and other company data show a reckless disregard for workers' safety and a high and dangerous level of risk-taking on the part of those entrusted to manage the company which is critical to the financial well-being of the country. Petrotrin's own documents paint a damning picture of criminal negligence where operators fail to follow basic safety rules, where serious mechanical integrity maintenance issues that cost money are pushed aside or deferred and where the same recommendations on how to avoid a repeat of the same catastrophic incidents, including workplace fatalities, are ignored only to happen again with the same tragic results. Warnings Ignored Report after report echo the same safety concerns: critical plant and equipment found to be in a condition that made it unreliable, inoperable fire detection systems, failure to manage risk and take care of outstanding maintenance issues, poor system of enforcement and flagrant violations of company GFIs (General Field Instructions) and industry codes and best practices. As reported previously in this series, a lot of the incidents, including the December 17 oil spill, are self-inflicted Petrotrin setbacks. The company had full knowledge of serious identified safety hazards yet recklessly and dangerously continued to use aged and severely corroded pipelines to move hazardous product. It did the same thing three years ago, ignoring the advice of a March 2011 inspection report to immediately change out severely corroded and pitted tubing of the fractionator overhead system at the No 2 HTU (Hydrotreater) plant at Pointe-a-Pierre. Subsequent events showed that Petrotrin ignored the advice to its peril. On July 2, 2011, a power failure led to the loss of the overhead cooling fans and a reflux pump which caused a sudden and dramatic rise in system pressure and temperatures sparking a fire that cost the company $1.2 million, including production losses. Clyde Rambaran, a senior refinery official and lead investigator appointed to review the circumstances surrounding the fire, in a report on the incident, pointed to the company's failure to act on important maintenance advice, specifically replacement of worn tubing. He found the primary cause of the fire to be \\\"the auto-ignition of a mixture of combustible material that was released from leaking tubes from the coolers\\\". The company appointed prober said a number of contributing factors created the perfect environment for the fire, namely\\u2014high pressures and temperatures, unavailable cooling capability and a \\\"ready source of combustible material from leaking flanges, tubes and plugs as a result of heat exposure from the fire\\\". The overhead system which operates on an ordinary working day at 10psi and about 335-400 degrees Fahrenheit on that fateful July day experienced pressures above 15psi and temperatures exceeding 615 degrees Fahrenheit. \\\"The abnormal process conditions in combination with the condition of the tubes in the coolers provided the correct recipe for the fire,\\\" said Rambaran, noting that the integrity of the coolers was compromised by \\\"the outstanding recommended repairs.\\\" He noted that the fractionation overhead system was inspected in November 2010 but the inspection engineering report recommending an \\\"immediate re-tubing\\\" was not forthcoming until five months later. The fire broke out five months after the report was produced\\u2014ten months after the problem was first identified. The Rambaran report also identified gaps in the emergency response, fire fighting systems, regulatory breaches under the OSH Act and maintenance of equipment integrity. \\\"Each gap,\\\" he said, \\\"highlights the importance of Process Safety Management to the organisation. Therefore increased attention and action to strengthen the mechanical integrity programme to the appropriate level of detail, strict adherence to Petrotrin's Management of Change procedure, operating procedures, provision of a dedicated hydrant system and enhanced training for the fire department were the principal recommendations to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.\\\" The report to vice president, Refining and Marketing, Mado Bachan urged: \\\"In the field of maintenance and reliability it was recommended that Petrotrin do not procrastinate doing preventive maintenance on high criticality assets. Without data, there is little chance of reaching correct conclusions. Decisions, both those made and those avoided, bring major negative consequences. The decision to not manage operational risk can ultimately result in disasters.\\\" Rambaran warned: \\\"To manage Petrotrin's operations more efficiently and to continue the drive to sustainable development all stakeholders must focus on the targets at hand and the conviction to purport safe work practices or run the risk of business interruptions that could pose a threat to the economic viability of Petrotrin.\\\" Luckily, there were no reported injuries but an inspection done after the fire found that 64 plugs were of the wrong type. Instead of high quality carbon steel, monel plugs were used. Rambaran said: \\\"It was an area of concern.\\\" But there was plenty of concern all around. He found several safety breaches under the OSH Act and a planned plant turnaround for the No. 2 HTU unit in February 2011 had been pushed back to August, one month after the fire broke out. Also, the recommended \\\"immediate re-tubing\\\" was not done. The report noted a long history of problems associated with startup of the spare reflux pump. The company prober said had the spare remote pump facility been available; the sudden rise in temperatures would have been averted. Systemic safety issues and failure to follow proper protocols have led to avoidable tragedies over the last decade. Two accident reports of workplace fatalities obtained by the Sunday Express show clear breaches of company-issued GFIs, HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) and OSHA violations, among other things. Safety lapses at the refinery led to the deaths of contract workers Joseph Carrington (July 24, 2012) and Finbar Adonis (December 9, 2007). In the case of Carrington, some of the same unsafe conditions, GFI violations, inadequate supervision and inattention to hazards that led to Adonis tragic end in 2007 happened again six years later. Carrington died following a blowout of a valve bonnet during pre-commissioning plant activities on a process pipeline at the Fluidised Catalictic Cracking Unit (FCCU). The investigation report by Garry Solomon found the blowout was forceful enough to knock Carrington's safety helmet clear off his head. The valve bonnet blew, in part, because the pipeline had not been depressurised and was under an operating pressure of 85psi at the time of the incident. Carrington was knocked off the scaffolding support after being slammed against the top rail of the platform which bent on impact. Solomon cited serious work safety flaws, including non-compliance with the Permit to Work System, absence of body harness for scaffolding supports over six feet high and failure to identify the specific job tasks, among other things. The Solomon report said the line pressure \\\"constituted an unsafe condition for removing the bolts on the gland and the valve bonnet. The task was not specifically stated on the work permit. This is a breach of the Permit To Work System, section 2.2: role of the site official, a breach of GFI 63, GFI 80 and a breach of section 6 (2) (a) of the OSH Act.\\\" He noted that the probe team found it \\\"very strange and unusual that during the process of removing all the bonnet flange stud bolts estimated to be over one hour that no plant official observed this activity, especially if this activity was not to be undertaken.\\\" Adonis died after falling off a scaffolding support after being sprayed by a gush of steam condensate from an overhead six inch vent pipe at the No. 2 Catalytic Reforming Unit at the refinery. Improper administration of Permit To Work System, non-compliance with GFIs, safety harness violations and failure to provide a safe workplace were among the contributing conditions that led to his death. All three accident reports and subsequent events at the state oil and gas company highlight a persistent management failure to implement important maintenance repairs.

Pic by Trevor Watson Repairs underway at M1 Tasker Road, Princes Town. Pic by Trevor Watson A portion of the M1 Tasker Road in Princes Town collapsed last night, as heavy rains lashed parts of south Trinidad. And motorists are being advised to use alternative routes, as the roadway, leading into Princes Town, can accommodate single lane traffic only. Princes Town Regional Corporation chairman, Gowrie Roopnarine, said a depression was formed three weeks ago. He said a concrete cylinder washed away in floodwaters. \\u201cFollowing that work was done to build up the area, but the cylinder was not replaced. Last night, with the heavy rainfall the area collapsed about four feet,\\u201d he said. Roopnarine said the Tasker Road was the responsibility of the Ministry of Works and Transport. However, the regional corporation assisted by placing barriers to cordon off the area. \\u201cThe road has now become a single lane. We placed barriers to prevent any accidents,\\u201d he said. Roopnarine said the ministry was informed of the latest development and has given the assurance that the roadway would be repaired and reopened to traffic soon. Princes Town MP Barry Padarath said he was aware of that the road had collapsed. He said the Ministry of Works had been contacted for necessary action. Motorists have been advised to use alternative routes, along the Naparima/Mayaro Road and Manahambre Road. Disaster Management Units ready Disaster Management Units (DMU) in the southern region are ready in the event of any cases of natural disasters. DMUs at the Penal/Debe, Siparia, Point Fortin and Princes Town regional corporations have confirmed that they were ready to take on any event. Coordinator at the Princes Town DMU Vedesh Lall said with the threatening weather conditions the department stands ready. \\u201cWe have relief supplies ready and waiting. Teams have been called and they too are waiting for further instructions. We have had no calls for flooding in the area. The supplies we have are tarpaulins, mattresses, hampers and makeshift cots,\\u201d he said. An official at the DMU office for Siparia said the only reported incident yesterday was a fallen tree along Lily Trace, Siparia where a team was already at the scene. The tree collapsed alongside a drain, however, the official said with the continuing rainfall the drain is \\u201cfilling up quickly\\u201d. An official at the DMU office in Point Fortin said there were no reports of any disasters and are prepared should there be any reports to help the citizens. The DMU office in Penal/Debe was also monitoring the weather conditions. The official said there were street and flash flooding along low laying areas on Tuesday, however, these have subsided. Flooding affects elderly man Eighty-three-year-old Bridgemohan Heeralal is blaming the incomplete Solomon Hochoy Highway extension to Point Fortin for his sleepless nights. Heeralal, who lives alone at Eccles Trace, Grants Road, Rousillac said he has suffered tremendous losses due to flooding. He said his crops of two acres of land washed away in last month's flooding caused by Tropical Storm Bret. And with the recent rainfall, he said, floodwaters had rose to at least three feet under his house. \\u201cI cannot sleep at home because of the flood. This began after the highway stopped. They had started to build a bridge to divert the water but didn't continue. Now all the water is diverted to my house. I made several complaints but nothing has been done. I am the only one affected by this so they are not paying attention to me,\\u201d he said. The elderly man said his washing machine was destroyed and fears he would have to leave his home soon. \\u201cIf this continues I cannot live there.

The men - Johnny Basdeo, Shiva Ramlochan, Shivanand Singh, Nirmal Ramlochan and Renwick Daniel - are from the San Juan/Barataria constituency. Khan in a statement issued on Wednesday, said he hoped the incident would serve as a \\u201ccautionary tale\\u201d to others to be prepared for sea journeys. Khan said: \\u201cI commend Captain Vincent Delfosse and the crew of the Calypso Sprinter as well as the members of the Coast Guard and everyone who was instrumental in the rescue of five fishermen in the Gulf of Paria who were stranded in the Sea after their boat had capsized. This matter could have easily turned more tragic had the passengers and crew aboard the Water Taxi not intervened when they did, as the men had already been floating in the choppy waters for over three hours before being rescued.\\u201d He added: \\u201cThis being said, it is also apparent through a photograph captured during the incident, that none of the five fishermen were wearing life-jackets, despite the fact that the regulation for small fishing vessels, as they one they were helming, requires all passengers to be outfitted with one before setting sail. In the wake of this incident therefore I am calling upon the Coast Guard to increase their inspections of these vessels to ensure that the passengers are kept safe and prevent any calamities that can result through this negligence. Just as seat-belts are mandatory and necessary in land vehicles to prevent severe injury and loss of life in accidents, so to do these life-jackets prevent persons from drowning in such incidents as that which took place yesterday.\\u201d The MP said: \\u201cTo this end, I am also willing to donate life-jackets to these five individuals, who are also my constituents, to ensure that they are prepared and secured if they venture into the sea in the future. I hope that the harrowing experience of these men, will also serve as a cautionary tale to any other fishermen and seafarers who are not readily equipped for their voyages, as such disaster can strike at any moment and only through preparation can they avert severe catastrophe.\\u201d And the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard is also advising all people venturing out to sea to wear lifejackets or have floating devices stocked on the vessels. Lieutenant Sherron Manswell, the public relations officer for the Coast Guard told the Express on Wednesday, during this time of year, the seas were extremely rough and extra caution was needed in the nation's waters. Manswell said: \\u201cMy advice to anyone going to sea for a fishing exhibition or just to have fun, is to please walk with your necessary equipment that will be able to safeguard yourself, life jackets, radios, phones that are charged, flares, anything that will be able to sustain your life in the event of an unforeseen accident. It is important that you have these apparatus and devices on board to ensure your safety because the water sometimes is not safe.\\u201d He said other floating devices such as floating rings and noodles and extra pieces of cloth for waving could also be taken on the journey. Manswell said: \\u201cWe have seen many people die at sea. It is important to leave information with your friends or family who will be looking out for you so that they too can inform the authorities if anything happens. It is always important to have some form of communication as to whether or not the person who goes out have not returned or you haven't heard from them in a long time.\\u201d TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Flying in from Trinidad en route from New York, the plane landed at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport in darkness and heavy rain at 1.30 a.m. It overshot the runway, crashed through the perimeter fence, and snapped in two, coming to a stop before it reached a 200-foot ravine. Several of these factors could easily have turned the episode into a far worse disaster in which dozens of lives might have been lost. In the event, of the 157 passengers and six crew members, 35 were injured, five seriously, and most while escaping from the plane after it had come to a stop. Nevertheless, this is by far the worst accident in the history of Caribbean Airlines and of its predecessor, BWIA, in over half a century. The incidentand its aftermaththerefore have grave implications for the reputation and the future of the airline, which is not only the national carrier of Trinidad and Tobago, but is also positioning itself to become a major regional carrier, especially through its links with Air Jamaica. Caribbean Airlines and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago responded to the incident with speed and thoroughness, recognising the seriousness of the situation. The airline issued frequent and regular updates, and CAL's chairman, George Nicholas, and other officials flew to Guyana. Transport Minister Devant Maharaj also addressed a press conference before flying to Guyana later on Saturday together with Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Surujrattan Rambachan, and other senior government officials. Two ministers who happened to be in Guyana on government business, Housing Minister Dr Roodal Moonilal and Trade and Industry Minister Stephen Cadiz, also stepped in, collaborating with the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority, and, in Mr Cadiz's case, visiting the injured passengers in hospital. There has naturally been widespread speculation about the cause of the incident, with possible contributory factors named as inadequate runway lighting, human error, the poor weather conditions, or a fault in the aircraft itself. Mr Nicholas said on Saturday that officials of the US National Transportation Safety Board were already on the way to lead investigations into the incident. The NTSB will work with the civil aviation authorities of both Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, the airline, and Boeing, the manufacturer of the plane. It is essential that the investigators determine the cause of this incident and that the necessary steps are identified and taken to avoid similar events and to preserve the airline's safety record, and most importantly, the lives of its passengers and crews.

Rebuilding has yet to fully begin in many coastal communities. Four days after my arrival in Japan I had the pleasure of travelling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train. Although the bullet train travels at 300 kilometres per hour, you don't feel the speed while sitting in it. It is only when you pass another bullet train going in the opposite direction or when you attempt to take a picture of the train in motion while standing on the platform on the railway station that you understand why the word \\\"bullet\\\" is used. The scenic view which the ride affords, along with the train's adjustable chairs, ample luggage space and washroom facilities made my hour-long ride pleasant. The Japanese seem to take this for granted. What is more significant to them is the fact that on March 11, 2011(referred to by the Japanese as 3/11)when a massive earthquake, of 9.0 magnitude struck, there was not a single casualty on the train system. Within two seconds of the occurrence of the first tremors, known as the S waves, the electrical supply to the trains' overhead wiring was automatically cut, and an emergency braking system brought all the trains to a simultaneous halt, one minute and ten seconds before the biggest tremor hit. All 27 trains were stopped without derailment, injuries or fatalities. And it is largely because of this amazing fact and this technological reality that a visit to JR Railway was slotted into our itinerary. The Japanese have spent a lot of money, time and energy developing the structures that could effectively treat with disasters, particularly earthquakes of severe intensity triggering tsunamis. By 2009, all carriages had been fitted with an early earthquake warning system. Similarly at Japan's largest urban redevelopment project, Roppongi Hills, there is an elaborate earthquake-proof system which includes on site its own energy plant through which electricity generation and supply is achieved. The district's large scale gas cogeneration system served it in good stead during the March 11 earthquake and the chaotic period afterward when many other parts of the country were without power. Roppongi Energy Service Company was not only able to give its corporate tenants and residents a stable power, but its excess power was sent to Tokyo Electric Power Company. There is a wine restaurant on the top floor (47th floor) of the main building at Roppongi Hills and during the earthquake not a single wine glass broke, an official proudly told us during our tour. Japan's most prominent recent construction, the Toyko Skytree, which at 634 metres is the highest tower in the world, has been built using a vibration control system which minimises the shaking of the tower caused by earthquakes and strong winds. (Japan is also prone to typhoons). If one characteristic strikes you about the Japanese it is their constant desire to improve on everything, their expectation of a lifting of standards and the complete lack of a snug, laid-back, complacent attitude, characteristic of our own. And this search for excellence applies to all thingslarge or small. At the end of every interview we conducted and every place we visited, all ten journalists (two from the Caribbean and eight from Latin America) were given assessment sheets and we were required to rate each interviewee, his/her comments, content, presentation and make suggestions for improvements. These evaluation sheets were given out daily and there was no getting away from completing them. \\\"We want to improve,\\\" said Chika Fukuda, one of our two guides from the Foreign Press Centre, who along with an interpreter chaperoned us during our ten-day trip. Naturally, the Japanese are also sticklers for time and punctuality. Each interview, each tour had a time-span which was predetermined and which was not to be altered because it would disrupt the chain of assignments, leading to people (who also have to be interviewed or give tours) having to wait, which was considered a no-no. On one occasion when the schedule went out of wack because of an unforeseen circumstancethe chartered bus which drove us around got in an accidentour guide, Yuki (Yoshida), was at her wits' end. The technological savvy of the Japanese is also evident. Ipads and powerpoint presentations were par for the course. But I expected all of this. What I did not expect was a technologically-smart toilet facility. The \\\"Toto Washlet\\\" is a multi-purpose toilet bowl which with the press of a knob on the power box, caters to a variety of needs. The power box has a seat warmer, a deodoriser and water pressure control buttons which are activated the moment one sits. The box also has a water spray and a bidet button. In some of the public toilets the power box also has a noise maker (presumably to mask any embarrassing noises). This facility was in every washroom and in some of the less sophisticated places, this ultra modern facility shared space with the very traditional Japanese toilet. The seat warmer came in very handy during those times when temperatures were as low as minus six degrees and the interior of the buildings was relatively cold. The coldest days in Japan were those two days when we visited the historical sites of the Buddhist temples Zuiganji Temple and Motsu-Ji Templeand the Hiraizumi Cultural Heritage Centre which are among the UNESCO World Heritage sites. The Golden Hall at Hiraizumi with its intricate metalwork and inlaid mother of pearl daises in which the bodies of former great rulers are enshrined, is a sight to behold. The temples are situated on hilly terrain and as I made my way upward, it was snowing so heavily that even in my Timberland winter boots, I was sometimes skating, (or rather ski-ing) backwards. Before you enter a Buddhist temple, you must take off your shoes. With no heating in the temple, the cold ground bit at my feet, even in my thick socks. But the visit was worth it, as I learnt about Japan's rich cultural heritage. My stay in Japan had an itinerary which took up every minute of our time from about nine each morning to six every afternoon, when there was back-to-back activity. The government of Japan, no doubt was determined to get maximum returns on the taxpayers' dollars which had paid for this trip. And the work ethic and professionalism of its public servants, politicians and members of the private sector ensured that this goal was met. This is a very goal-centred society and that is abundantly evident. Whilst the people who have been most affected by the March 11 earthquake are unhappy with the pace of reconstruction, absent is the natural, instinctively tendency to be critical of everything as obtains in Trinidad and Tobago. And this is because there is in Japan a stronger sense of community, country and the responsibilities that are concomitant with that. Also, the NGOs, such as the Red Cross and private sectors, are more robustly involved in the reconstruction process. Toyota's Masami Doi, recalled during our visit to the company's head office in Tokyo that \\\"Mr (Akio) Toyoda ordered the stopping of the automobile production line because the first priority was to take care ... of the workers at the company and the people of the region\\\". The company also provided the basic necessities of life to affected people. Coming from this part of the world one could not help but notice in the face of Japan's challenges as it grapples to rebuild the country and economy, there is a vast difference in attitude between us and them and the way the two countries deal with crises.

It was something that the first responders, fire and police, etc, should have been able to handle on their own without external assistance in terms of coordinatingand command. \\\"It was not something that we were mandated to get involved in.\\\" Noel said, \\\"If it was on a larger scale then we would have gotten involved and immediately coordinatedthings a bit differently, in a different measure.\\\" But Roger Ganesh, Director of Highways in the Ministry of Works and Transport,who visited the area along with Works Minister Jack Warner on Tuesday, said Noel's comments were ridiculous. \\\"You know what is really bad about this whole thing ODPM did not have a clue to what was taking place.

Ganesh said, \\\"They (ODPM officials) were calling us to find out what was going on when they are the ones who supposed to be coordinating and managingany such incident or accidents like that especially when you have a gas spill or a toxic spill or something major.

On a fateful December day when Christmas shopping occupied the minds of most people, a 16-inch diameter sea line broke at the State-owned refinery, sending a rush of black fuel oil into the Gulf of Paria and along the south-western coastline. The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisherfolk and people in poor coastal communities. The Sunday Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this country's worst environmental disaster. This is the fifth in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, Head, Express Investigative Desk State oil and gas giant Petrotrin told outright lies on several key points about the December oil spills, including the so-called sabotage claim related to Riser Platform 5 (RP), Sunday Express investigations have found. And, the Kamla Persad-Bissessar Government played a part in facilitating the pattern of deceit instead of holding the State energy company to account. Internal investigation reports and other company documents obtained by this newspaper indicate the Persad-Bissessar administration and Petrotrin misled the Parliament and the public about the events of the December oil spills. Petrotrin lied to the country when it reported a spill incident involving RP No 5 on the afternoon on December 17. The incident in fact happened on December 18, according to Petrotrin's own documents. The company took four days after No 10 sea line ruptured to acknowledge there was an incident at its Pointe-a-Pierre refinery and even then failed to provide critical information that it had close to 7,500 barrels of unaccounted-for fuel oil somewhere in the Gulf of Paria. The company which repeatedly asserted that unknown saboteurs were responsible for the series of so-called mystery leaks hid the facts relating to the No 10 incident for long critical days and told an outright lie about the timeline relating to the RP No 5 spill. An internal company document said that the RP No 5 incident took place on December 18 and not on the 17th as the company made out. The report also contradicts claims by the board and management of Petrotrin and Government officials that foul play was involved. Sabotage was not even a distant spectre on the Soldado horizon, according to the company's own investigation report into the incident. The report by company man Dexter Hector put the blame squarely on a blown rubber gasket which, according to him, should never have been put on the line to start with. As previously reported in this series, Petrotrin has ignored its own safety warnings and used band-aid fixes to keep the refinery operating in a dangerous game of Russian roulette. The Hector Report found the rubber gasket which blew on December 18 was badly flawed and did not meet the API industry standard for offshore platform piping systems. There was no Management of Change (MOC) document related to the change-out of the rubber gasket in 2005 and no \\\"fitness for service\\\" certificate that the rubber gasket was a safe substitute for the required metal part. For reasons not clear, Petrotrin lied and shaded the truth about much of the facts related to the December spills, including spill incidents that never happened. It reported a total of three oil leaks involving its joint venture partner, Trinity Exploration and Production. A spokesman for the company told the Sunday Express of a single oil leak at an onshore facility at Rancho Quemado which was contained in the space of a day with 80 of the 90 barrels of crude recovered. He confirmed the company did report its suspicion that the line had been tampered with but admitted there was no evidence to prove this and \\\"nothing more has come to light\\\". The company spokesman, who declined to speak on the record, made clear Trinity had no oil leaks at sea. He said there was an incident on December 24 in Brighton but this related to \\\"a tiny but not measurable gas leak\\\". In throwing up its sabotage conspiracy, the Petrotrin board and executive made heavy weather of an unprecedented 11 leaks in ten days. In fact there were seven. A review of the company's own data and other information show that the company counted coastal sites impacted by the oil spills as actual spills. The seven identified spills are Petrotrin's four, Trinity's two (counting the tiny gas leak) and Neal and Massy Energy Resources Ltd one. 1. The No 10 sea line at the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery on December 17 responsible for 7,453 barrels of fuel oil being spilled into the sea. 2. RP No 5 in the main Soldado Field on December 18 (crude). 3. Platform 17 in the company's East Soldado Field on December 19 (crude). 4. No 15 sea line at the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery on December 26 (fuel oil). 5. Lease operator Trinity's Rancho Quemado incident on December 21 (single suspected case of sabotage for which no evidence has been presented) crude. 6. The miniscule natural gas leak in the Brighton Field on December 24. 7. And Neal and Massy's loss of three barrels of crude in a forested area in Moruga on December 24. Investigations suggest an agricultural vehicle called a timberjack went over a line which sprang a leak. Two-and-a-half barrels were recovered. And, as the Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) found, in both preliminary and final test results, all of the weathered oil samples collected except from a barge at the LABIDCO Industrial Estate, tested positive for \\\"bunker C type fuel oil\\\" which carried the same characteristics as the samples taken from the No 10 refinery spill on December 17. In the immediate aftermath of the No 10 spill, Petrotrin added to the confusion by suggesting the thick black sludge that was washing up on the coastline along the south- western peninsula was crude. But as this Sunday Express investigation has found, the timeline of Petrotrin's deceit is important. Company logs and records show the company knew by 6 a.m. on December 17 that No 10 sea line had ruptured and spilled over 7,000 barrels of fuel oil into the sea. It knew it had missed two crucial inspections on the physically weakened line, knew that No 10 had serious problems long before the accident, knew it had failed to heed its own safety warnings and knew the financial consequences of its negligent behaviour. Company photographs taken from a helicopter fly-by at 11.30 a.m. on December 18 showed an oil sighting at the Oropouche bank (north of La Brea), a full 24 hours before the RP No 5 blew a gasket leak and spewed crude into the sea\\u2014the second leak on the December record. Petrotrin went further, declaring that preliminary laboratory tests conducted on samples collected at the different points of impact made crude the likely culprit. And to make sure nobody connected the crude spilled in the Soldado field to what was blackening the La Brea shoreline, the company asserted aerial and marine sightings found no connection among the four company spills caused by its own negligence. It fails to explain how an oil and gas giant, in the business for 100 years, and conducting a multitude of tests on petrochemical product on a daily basis, could get it so wrong, how it managed to mistake a refined fuel for crude. It also fails to address the $64-million question of its thinking on where exactly its fuel oil went to.

Whilst there is beauty and goodness, life is also full of misery, cruelty, accident, disease and the ravages of time. So as the human species, we developed society, not to save us from individual disaster or difficulty, a task impossible for any nation or institution, but to help us deal with the inevitable challenges or obstacles, first by providing opportunity for individual empowerment and also through creating the environment and infrastructure for ameliorating personal or community tragedy. Therefore, the strength, effectiveness and quality of any society can be measured by the opportunity it provides to the individual to develop one's talents; the security as he/she pursues personal goals; and the support activated when we falter or are felled by accident, debilitating circumstances or personal tragedy. In this regard, there is an obligation to recognise the economically challenged are more vulnerable than most, requiring special attention if the original concept and prospect for society and nationhood are to remain intact. So how does Trinidad and Tobago measure up as nation and society The question came to mind from that very sad inci\\u00ad\\u00addent in Bayshore, Marabella, near the old train line, reported last Tuesday in the Express, \\u201cFire after Prayers\\u201d, providing an insight into the fragility of the society's vulnerable, whose plight will become increasingly acute as economic conditions deteriorate . This is what happened: on Boxing Day, a four-year-old autistic boy and his five young siblings were left in the care of an aunt while their mo\\u00ad- ther went to a nearby shop. The aunt said the boy was naked, playing in the yard: \\u201cSo I told him to put on some clothes. His father is in jail and his mother always has a candle lighting for the father. He sees his mother praying by the candle and would go by the candle and pray for his daddy. So this morning, instead of going for his clothes, he went and pick up the candle to pray. And he drop it on the bed.\\u201d The result was a fire that razed three buildings, leaving 28 members of an extended family homeless, including 12 children. Neighbours had formed a bucket brigade, but to no avail. The family held together, helped by the community who gave up celebrations to render support, grandmother of the child consoling everyone, saying: \\u201cWe will rebuild. Don't blame the child. He was praying for his father. Have mercy on him,\\u201d as she held on to the fact, \\u201cthe Bible was saved, it scorched, but it was saved\\u201d. Such pathos, such vulne\\u00adrability, such resilience; so much to build upon! Here in the midst of struggle compounded by tragedy, we have caring, community, courage and defiant optimism, eternal qualities that ensured our survival as the human species. People and their spirit are truly the only real wealth of a nation, its enduring strength, its possibility for greatness. But in Trinidad and Tobago, it is a trapped resource, untapped, as we move into an uncertain future. Do our leaders see this Have we, since Indepen\\u00addence, thought of these positive characteristics displayed over the years and in Marabella on Boxing Day Has our \\u201cculture\\u201d ever celebrated this human potential for magnificent action existing at all levels in this country Or do we think \\u201cwining and jamming\\u201d is \\u201cthe thing\\u201d, the corrosive Carnival deca\\u00addence for which we spend hundreds of millions every year Is our \\u201cculture\\u201d killing us Can we ever escape it Has political leadership ever engendered refinement, civilisation and national community in Trinidad and Tobago This is a nation ready and longing for an inspiration we never had. Our leaders have never capitalised on the innate courage and capacity of our people for the social re-engineering and cultural revolution that would have brought the depth, enlightenment and inner resilience now urgently required by our society and economy. Instead, the inevitability of human vulnerability has acutely worsened in Trinidad and Tobago, even after hundreds of billions from oil and gas booms. Today, the state is unable to adequately perform its primary role as ameliorator of the pain citizens experience, simply because they are fragile human beings. Can we rely, for example, on our health and security systems when the National Security minister is a walking derelict after 16 failed months on the job; when the Health minister, once gearing for an \\u201cintellectual war on salt\\u201d, celebrates a wasted year with his superficial Santa buffoonery in the nation's hospitals Will the Culture minister engender cohesiveness and a national spirit by merely donning a new wig for every press opportunity And will the Finance minister...Well, more of him another time. But, oh, the rampant superficiality in this country for the past 60 years! And as we start 2017, we are condemned to the sameness, the New Year already old. We remain an uninspired society, the national spirit either flat, frivolous or fatuous. Nothing summons us as a people; no one capable of stirring the soul. And so we will continue, as we did for the past 60 years, without the treasured experience of building a nation, not having been called upon to do it, spoilt in those years by the largesse and unearned wealth from our petroleum resources, rendering \\u201cliberty\\u201d, \\u201cglory\\u201d, \\u201cstruggle\\u201d and \\u201csacrifice\\u201d not experiences but platitudes we regurgitate as part of the ritualistic verbiage at Independence. But be warned. Now we either be different or die. We face our sternest test since sovereignty. The economy is heading for a free fall. Social decay is reaching incurabi\\u00adlity. Somebody somewhere better start thinking deeply. Trinidad and Tobago cannot endure uninspired. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom.

Photo: Trevor Watson Dr Wayne Kublalsingh being taken from the Siparia Magistrates' Court today. Photo: Trevor Watson SMOKE coming from the Emergency Department at San Fernando General Hospital triggered an evacuation of patients and staff on Wednesday night. Anil Gosine, chief executive officer of the South-West Regional Health Authority, yesterday said the smoke did not emanate from a fire, but because of maintenance work being carried out in the air-conditioning system. Fortunately, it was not more than a false alarm. But the main thing is that the evacuation plan worked well, said Gosine in a telephone interview. Around 10 p.m., smoke was seen in the Emergency Department, where there were approximately 40 patients, as well as members of hospital staff. Gosine said the head doctor on duty, Dr Robin Sinanan, and the nurse in charge, Alana Rahim, quickly implemented the disaster management plan and had patients evacuated to the muster point on the hospitals compound. The San Fernando Fire Service was called in and inspected the premises. Within half an hour, fire officers declared the premises safe, and staff and patients were allowed to return to the Accident and Emergency Department, said Gosine. Gosine explained that maintenance work being done on the air-conditioning system in the Accident and Emergency Department caused sparks, then smoke. In one area, the contractor needed to cut the ducting and, while cutting, one or two sparks created smoke that went through the ducting into the emergency department, said Gosine. The patients were taken to the muster point while the fire department was called in. This was really a precautionary measure because after a few minutes the staff realised it was just some smoke that came through.

However, all this was par for the course in an exercise undertaken in response to the call by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM) for organisations to participate in its 'Exercise Turbulence 2016' initiative.

Rishi Siew, TPRC's disaster coordinator said: \\\"We created an atmosphere where light poles were uprooted, trees strewn across the roadway blocking traffic and people lying on the ground suffering from injuries. \\\"We then tested the response time of all the emergency services; fire, police, Red Cross and the Global Medical Response of Trinidad and Tobago (GMRTT).

Of course, that's because those in the know haven't spoken out or made any true reviews about the real situation, and the incompetent people who call themselves \\\"experts\\\". At the recent Beyonce show there was great confusion due to the lack of proper signage and ill-informed security personnel who were unable to minimise the chaos at the start. Many of the security personnel were more interested in getting photos of Beyonce with their mobile phones and a good viewing position than ensuring that safeguards were being maintained, they had no interest in the safety and security of peoplea large crowd in attendance and the potential for a disaster. In exiting the facility, all the main exits were blocked by the same restrictive entrance scaffolding barriers, making exiting the facility a nightmare and a potential safety hazard. If there was any accident resulting in the need for a speedy exit, there would have been a disaster and many people would have died or suffered injury. So where are these \\\"experts\\\" who are quick to beat their chests when nothing happens. God help us if a real test occurs, and why the need for all this heavy artillery by the police at an event with so many people in attendance Do you know the carnage that would occur if a sub-machine gun is used in such a crowd. It really makes me wonder if they really know what they are doing On a related note, the use of mounted police is an important crowd control tool for the Carnival and large events, but the police, from the point of view of health, should ensure that the mess left behind by their horses on the roads should be picked up immediately Where are the Health Authority and OSHA people again More incompetence.

Being an atheist, I don't think Jehovah, Allah, Bhagavan, or Olurun was responsible for this. But believers are supposed to believe that God has power over everything, including pimples. God even wins football matches, Olympic medals and, of course, elections. That's why the voice of the people is the voice of God although, to judge from the internet chat groups, this would mean that God is ignorant, venomous, and ungrammatical. So the IRO decided to have a week of prayer, again, because religious leaders believe in doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result. The only difference is that, this time, their National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving has free food and entertainment sponsored by the Ministry of Planning, which is presumably following God's plan. Now I don't believe that prayer works, but I admit that the only basis I have for this opinion is fact. While it is true that cancer sometimes goes away, it is even truer an amputee never grows back his leg. Of course, believers won't accept this as proof that prayer is pappyshow. Believers always say that they have personal experience of prayer working. And I believe these believers. I believe that, if 100,000 people buy Lotto tickets, ninety-nine per cent of them would pray to win: and the one person who does win will say God answered his prayers, while the 99,999 losers will go and buy Lotto again and pray to win next week. In any case, praying to God is either futile, blasphemous, conceited, or sinful. It must be, once believers believe that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and has a Divine Plan. That would mean He already knows what you're going to pray for and decided whether to grant your wish, so prayer is futile. And if you're praying for God to change His Divine Plan, that's blasphemy. Praying for change is also saying that you have a better Plan than God, which is conceit. So that leaves only one reason to pray: to show your neighbours how prayerful you are. But isn't vanity one of the Seven Deadly Sins What all this means is that the only sincere prayers to God are those which ask God to keep things as they are or change them only according to His plan, as revealed through His holy books. So, in order to save the believers' souls from Hell, reincarnation, or non-ancestry, I have written the following non-blasphemous prayers: Pray for floods Almighty God, mayst Thou flood my house and drown my car as Thou pleaseth, that we be reminded of the Original Sin which wiped all humanity from the Earth save Noah and his Ark and two of every creature, including mosquitoes. Elevate to the Works Ministry, oh God, men who will explain all disasters as an Act of You. Let not construction companies build proper drainage, nor citizens stop littering, nor Local Government councillors work for a living. In this way shall we experience trials and tribulations, oh Lord, that we might grow closer to Thee by mopping mud from our living rooms. Pray for traffic accidents Oh God, please ensure that traffic accidents happen, so that those who do not die but are only maimed may thank Thee for sparing their lives, while those who are killed would serve as a warning to others about the sins of strong drink, late liming, and defective tyres. For every fatality, oh God, a pastor or pundit or imam gets paid to put the fear of Thee into mourners, proving that those who are killed in accidents have not died senselessly but are fulfilling Thy divine purpose. Pray for murderers Most blessed God, we accept that Thou hath sent murderers onto us, that we shall not take the precious gift of life for granted, that we shall beat our children so they shall not become killers, and hang those who do become killers in order to show that killing is wrong, as stateth in Thy words, unless of course we are killing the infidels as also stated in Thy words. Pray for politicians Thank you, oh Lord, for giving us leaders who are venal, incompetent, and corrupt, that we shall never have faith in the laws of man but only in Thy divine laws. Let us not become like those nations with low crime and high prosperity, whose people go not to church save for weddings, funerals, and bazaars. We pray that our political leaders who proclaim their faith shall never be criticised by the IRO, because religious leaders also have to eat ah food. Pray for atheists Divine Father, we pray that Kevin Baldeosingh shall continue to demonstrate how rationality influences nobody important, so that our faith may continue to get us invited to official functions with jumbo shrimp. kbaldeosingh@hotmail.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

According to researchers from Swansea University's College of Science, wildfires destroy 4% of the Earth\\u2019s surface each year. It has also been estimated that 84% of all wildfires are caused by humans, according to researchers from the University of Colorado. Rising worldwide temperatures and weather extremes have further increased the incidence of fires. From campers who get outside and explore our forests and parks, to backyard chefs tending the open flames of their grills, responsible use of fire is critical to preventing accidents like those seen around the world in recent years. This sense of responsibility and a growing global urgency to help combat the devastating effects of wildfires inspired Zippo to take action. As creator of one of the most famous flames of all time, the iconic American brand is intimately aware of the power of fire. Zippo has teamed up with WOODCHUCK USA, creators of sustainably sourced wood-based products, as part of the BUY ONE. PLANT ONE.\\u00ae program. The partnership means that one tree will be planted for every windproof lighter sold from the Zippo Fight Fire with Fire collection. The program is part of a long-term vision to support reforestation efforts in the aftermath of fires around the globe, beginning this year in Madagascar. As the fourth largest island in the world, Madagascar has had 90% of its original forests destroyed. Reforestation will create habitats for endangered species, help absorb carbon, halt erosion and flooding \\u2014 and bring back healthy farming and fisheries. Lucas Johnson, Senior Brand Manager, Global Marketing at Zippo, states, \\u201cTemperatures are at the highest level on record and wildfires are affecting almost every continent on Earth, but unlike most natural disasters, the majority of wildfires are caused by humans. According to National Geographic, in the U.S. alone there are around 100,000 forest fires each year, clearing up to 9 million acres of land. The Zippo windproof lighter gives people the power of portable fire, but with this comes responsibility.\\u201d For individuals using fire, especially in regions susceptible to wildfires, it\\u2019s vital to follow practical safety measures. Here are some tips to help prevent wildfires: Camping and the outdoors When creating a bonfire, use a pre-made fire pit if available, or make a fire pit cleared of all vegetation with a boundary such as a circle of stones. Remove excess dead leaves or other potentially flammable debris from the area before lighting the fire. Never leave a fire, lantern or cook stove unattended, especially overnight. If the weather is windy, don't start a fire \\u2014 the risk is too high, as the embers can be carried across great distances and risk setting vegetation alight elsewhere. When you're finished with the fire, grill or stove, be sure to douse it thoroughly with water. Stir the coals or ashes to be sure all heat has been extinguished, and smother the campfire with dirt. If you see fire that appears unattended or out of control, call 911 or the local park service right away. In the backyard Check and follow all local ordinances regarding fires, whether for recreation or burning yard waste. Make sure the grill or bonfire is not near or underneath branches or other vegetation, or too close to your home. For a fire pit, clear all grass, dead leaves or other possibly flammable material, and create a clear boundary for the fire using stones or bricks. Consider fire risk when landscaping and maintaining your lawn and garden. Especially if you live in a wildfire-prone region, consult the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Firewise website for practical fire prevention tips such as using fire-resistant plants and creating a defensible zone around your home. Consistently remove dead and dry leaves, pine cones and other plant material that could fuel a fire as part of your regular lawn maintenance. Keep bushes and trees regularly pruned of dead branches. Don't use fire on a windy day, as the risk for fire spreading is too great. If celebrating with fireworks, keep water and/or a fire extinguisher handy and spray down nearby grass and other vegetation before lighting fireworks. Be sure to thoroughly douse used fireworks with water. Don't use fireworks at all if the weather is windy or if your area is under a Red Flag Warning. Making a difference Following these precautions to use fire responsibly is one way everyone can help prevent devastating wildfires. Every individual has the power to make a positive impact.

Take the time to learn how you can contribute to the fight against wildfires in your area and beyond, to help protect the planet for generations to come.

As much as four per cent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is lost through poor health, safety security and environment practices, said Eugene Tiah, president of the American Chamber of Commerce. He was speaking at yesterday's launch of a two-day HSSE seminar geared to improve local HSSE standards. \\\"HSSE best practice makes good business sense,\\\" Tiah said. He said improved employee morale, decreased absenteeism and increased productivity were some of the by-products of improved HSSE standards. He called on local organisations to adhere to stricter HSSE principles despite the global economic crisis and the resulting job losses. \\\"As the world experiences the turbulences of financial uncertainty and difficulty, the challenges to the implementation of HSSE best practice are compounded,\\\" he said, adding that employees are faced with more stress in this new environment. That combined with reduced spending on HSSE provisions could be a recipe for disaster, Tiah said. \\\"The potential implications are increased work-related stress, accidents and even fatalities,\\\" he said. Tiah also commended Government for its commitment to environmental management via the Environmental Management Authority (EMA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA). Rennie Dumas, Minister of Labour, said he was often \\\"disheartened\\\" to see workers being mistreated. \\\"I am happy when I hear institutions are concerned about the safety of workers,\\\" Dumas said.

But a news photographers job can get very dicey. Newspaper photographers are among that select group of people, including law enforcement and emergency personnel, who run towards danger, whether its a crime scene, fiery protests or natural disaster, to bring us pictures from the front line. In turn, photos depicting raw emotions taken during intense moments can impact viewers and may even lead to action in some cases. Take for instance the haunting photo of a starving child trying to reach a feeding centre in Sudan taken by the late South African photojournalist Kevin Carter in 1993. The photograph was published in magazines and newspapers throughout the world and drew attention to the famine in Sudan. The photo also earned Carter a Pulitzer Prize. Back at home, Woman spoke with press photographer Janelle (not her real name) who for the past few years has been pursuing her passion for photography at a local newspaper. She is one of the few female news photographers in T&T. I always wanted to be a photographer... when the opportunity for me to work in the photographic department presented itself, I jumped on it, and Im still here, she says. While she knew she always wanted to be a photographer, Janelle never knew that she would be covering news, nevertheless, she enjoys her job and gets her inspiration from seasoned photographers who have been on the field for many years. One main downside is safety; journalists cover crime stories and sometimes we are in certain areas right after or during gunshots between gangs and the police. At that moment, anybody is open to anything, says Janelle. Like journalists, press photographers are supposed to be objective and keep their emotions at bay which is not always easy. There are occasions especially in emotionally charged situations when taking pictures is difficult. I ask Janelle whether she has ever had that experience. Yes, yes, yes. There was this one time we went to a Diego Martin family whose brother was found murdered in his house. The way he was killed and hearing his family talk about it was extremely sad, and my emotions got the better of me. I couldnt even take the photo of the sister who was crying,Janelle confides. When we reached back to work, my supervisor at the time heard of what had happened and obviously I got a little talk about blocking out my emotions and doing what you have to do. Now no matter how sad an accident, murder of funeral scene is, I have to ensure I get what I went there for, and that is a newsworthy picture. There are two incidents in particular which stand out in Janelles mind. That would be the funeral service of Haydee Paul and her two children Shakira and Akasha who were killed in an accident last year on the Beetham Highway. Apart from seeing her family and friends express their feelings, Haydee was a primary school friend of mine. The other one would be the murder of Joel Apparicio in San Juan. Seeing a mother bawl after she witnessed the killing of her son is very painful, says Janelle. But being a news photographer still has its perks, Janelle has the opportunity to meet and photograph interesting people from all walks of life and from all over the world including ambassadors, prime ministers, musicians, actors, artists, managers, chefs you name it. And not all assignments Janelle covers include that danger element.

In May 2010, it was the Manning induced auto coup, while in 2011 it was the State of Emergency. It may be true, as some say, that \\\"bacchanal\\\" is baked in the Trinidad pie, and is now an ever present feature of public life in Trinidad and Tobago and that regardless of which party or coalition is in charge, one should always keep one's political seatbelt fastened. The current political cleavage is driven by the determination of large numbers of people that Ish and Steve must go to jail, and the corresponding view held by some that if one has money, one can do thing with impunity. In the process of waging this epic battle, all the political parties and the critical civil society groupings have come alive and has landed us with what is perhaps the most serious governance crisis that we have ever experienced. Ironically, the cock-up that triggered the events came in the midst of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of that Independence. The events rudely reminded us that notwithstanding the nice things we say about ourselveshow much better we are than those political gangsters in other parts of \\\"the Third World\\\", we are still on political \\\"skid row\\\". Corruption is now hypernormalised. What caused our political power failure How could legislation that all parliamentarians agreed was long overdue could have had such a bizarre outcome Was the outcome an accident which brought down our political power lines or a very cleverly crafted three-card trick As I try to make sense of the events, several conspiracy views contend for acceptance. One narrative has it that Volney is either venal, incompetent, has a few screws loose or all of the above. According to views such as these, the Prime Minister thankfully had the cohones and the integrity to rid the country and the ministry of him. Volney lied to his colleagues, is unfit for office, and we are well rid of him. There are however other prisms through which to view the events which resemble Rubic's cube. One view is that Volney was not the \\\"villain of the piece\\\", but the sacrificial lamb, the person who was chosen to fall on his sword in order to save the PP team from comprehensive disaster. That was easy to do, it is argued, because the minister not only looked the part, but had said and done weird things before, both in the judiciary and in ministerial office. It was possible that he could do other things that were beyond belief, particularly if someone made it worthwhile for him to do so. A third view is that Volney was neither the fall guy, the corruptee who accepts the pieces of silver, who was used by financiers who were privy to the plot, but his own man, someone who was driven by his own ideological and spiritual imperatives. Volney's assertions about his relationship with Kamla whom he seems to adore, and his God have in my view not been taken as seriously as perhaps they should. He has denied that he \\\"tiefed\\\" or did anything wrong, foolish or adventurist. If anything, Volney seems confused which is understandable. He has lost his job and his pension, the self-respect which men crave and who knows what else. One can feel the hurt and the bereavement. As asked plaintively, \\\"Why would I lie to my Cabinet colleagues\\\" He tells us that he tries not to lie, and that lying had caused him to lose his first wife and he is not about to lose his second by lying. His hands were clean and his conscience clear. He also had a God above who understood \\\"sin\\\" as others did not seem to. Whom was he accusing of being irreligious Volney went on to add (via Facebook) comments about his family's commitment to God: \\\"We are people of faith and we are covered by the blood of Jesus Christ. We need now to pray to God for strength for our Prime Minister, who is now overcome by Anand Ramlogan, that she may purge herself of the influence of one who is unelected by the people but influences her in a way that we the people must fear.\\\" (We however note that Volney seemed to have changed his mind about Ramlogan whom he said had nothing to do with the issue and had nothing to fear from Rowley). Volney also questioned the view that his colleagues did not know what was taking place. He noted that they were all intelligent men and women who could read and understand for themselves, and line up the dots in respect of what had to be done to effect the implementation of the law to which they were giving effect. In his view they could not fail to understand. Volney insists that Ish and Steve were not his priority. His agenda was to free those persons who might be innocent and unjustly deprived of their freedom because of the over crowding of the lists. This was the purpose for which the legislation was introduced and the reason why he sought to fast forward proclamation of section 34. As he waxed philosophically, \\\"People don't seem to appreciate, as I do, the presumption of innocence. You cannot jail people and have them with loss of liberty for up to ten years without a trial when you presume them to be innocent as of right.\\\" In sum, Volney's argument was that Ish and Steve were unintended beneficiaries of his concern to free those who were presumed to be free as of right. It was intended to clear the backlog as the Askov case had done in Canada in 1940 which had freed some 30,000 persons of criminal changes. According to Volney, freeing up such persons was for him a soul cleansing exercise. It addressed the question of the balance between right of the State to prosecute and the right of the citizen to a fair trial within a reasonable period. The matter is now a casualty of the cock-up. Volney was philosophic about his plight. Perhaps, he mused, God chose him for another vocation and another role. \\\"God is in charge, not Kamla.\\\" He thanked Jesus for giving him the opportunity to do something else with his life. Someone else would have the responsibility to execute the agenda of justice reform. Someone else would pilot the legislation that is being readied for Parliament. The cynics would of course dismiss Volney's cri de coeur and accuse him of lying and of being too clever by half about his motive. In the popular imagination, Volney was part of an elaborate conspiracy that for him went wrong. \\\"No,\\\" insists Volney. \\\"God who is the architect of all things wants me to recalibrate. He wants a change in my life. Next year I will be 60. Obviously God does not want this for me.\\\" The former judge turned politician indicated that he is grateful to Kamla for giving him the opportunity to serve. He who gives can take back! He however believes that Kamla ought to have accepted his explanations and accepted his resignation and allowed him to keep his pride. Firing him via TV was a hurtful and bitter pill that was driven by politics. To be frank, I do not know which of the many nancy stories I should believe. I am however sure that we have not yet seen the end. The \\\"fat lady\\\" has not yet sung.

With the stakes so high, in addition to picking out the perfect property, it\\u2019s critical to have the right insurance. While homeowners may start out with the right amount when they first purchase their home, over time, their policy can become outdated. Why? One big reason is inflation. \\u201cLabor and building material costs go up over time, which means that if your home were destroyed by a fire or natural disaster, for example, and you had to rebuild it in today\\u2019s dollars, it would very likely cost much more,\\u201d said Bob Buckel, vice president and product manager, Erie Insurance. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why we recommend that all homeowners get \\u2018guaranteed replacement cost\\u2019 coverage.\\u201d In addition to making sure your insurance keeps up with inflation, experts also recommend homeowners reach out to their insurance agent when: \\u2022 You remodel: 2019 is expected to be a popular year for remodeling, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity. Whether it\\u2019s putting on an addition or finishing the basement, be sure the extra square footage and finishes are listed on your policy. Why? If something were to happen (think: fire, water damage, etc.), you\\u2019ll want your insurance policy to provide enough funds for everything to be repaired or replaced. \\u2022 You make changes to outdoor space: The same is true with any remodeling to your outdoor space. The addition of an in-ground pool or fence can add value to your home. There are also liability concerns associated with certain equipment, such as a swimming pool or trampoline. Unfortunately, at least 148 children drowned in swimming pools last summer and many more were injured, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. You\\u2019ll want to make sure you\\u2019re properly covered in the event of an accident. \\u2022 You install a security system: You may qualify for a discount on your insurance if you\\u2019ve recently installed a security system. One study by the Electronic Security Association (ESA) looked at the 10 largest insurance companies and found many offer worthwhile premium discounts. \\u2022 You start a home-based business: Whether you have a side hustle or draw a full-time income from a home-based business, you may not have the right coverage in place. For example, if you\\u2019re selling LuLaRoe clothing and there\\u2019s a fire, your merchandise might not be covered since typical policies don\\u2019t always cover home-based businesses. You\\u2019ll most likely need an incidental business endorsement. Coverage from Erie Insurance could cost about $30 to $70 per year. \\u2022 You acquire valuables: Homeowners insurance covers your belongings, but generally only up to a certain dollar amount per item. So, if you acquire an expensive item, such as an engagement ring, a fur or a valuable artwork, you should talk to your insurance agent about adding special coverage. You may also need to provide a receipt or appraisal.

While people differ, one thing is common among all, they eat, drink, procreate and eventually die. Culture and religion lead different people in directions that may make one group to seem very different from another, but no matter what defines one group from another, none has been able to prevent diseases, sickness, accidents, disappointments and despair. Some people have learned over time that dancing, music, sharing with others, caring for each other and living in harmony with nature brings the human being the greatest joys. Almost every time I go to a funeral, it is the little things that one did to enhance the lives of another that is highlighted. I have never been to a funeral where family or loved ones boast about the accumulation of wealth or the amount of power one wielded. Its always to what extent we were able to positively impact the people we interacted with that determines our ultimate destiny or at the very least how people perceive our stay on earth. With this in mind I wish to challenge the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago to seek the greater good. What is wrong when as a nation we name our highest award after the Creator in Christian terms Other religions or people with different values should not be forced to accept the Trinity Cross, they can have the Order of T&T, but why eliminate our Christian history and values simply to be politically correct Why are we not insisting that our tax dollars are spent in ensuring that never again in our nations history we should be faced with a situation where our citizens are forced to sleep on chairs and on the floor in the corridors of our hospitals Why are we not opening up homes for the elderly where they can be treated with dignity Why are we not teaching our children to be tolerant of people of all cultures, races and beliefs and demonstrate the positives of loving each other Why are our aspirations evaluated by race, political party and culture rather than what is best for our nation Why is our politics divided in such a way that there are safe political seats anchored by ethnicity Trinidad and Tobago is blessed with natural resources, clean water, beautiful beaches, wonderful people and a location that protects our people from the ravages of natural disasters. In spite of these positives, however, there are people among us who are selfish, greedy, destructive, power hungry and wicked. It is because of these people that our cities and towns are dirty, our water courses are overgrown, our murder rate in among the highest per capita in the world, our system of justice has degenerated into one where street justice and revenge is replacing our courts and our children are living with a sense of hopelessness. It is up to us to face the challenges of tomorrow. We can put aside our sense of importance and silly pride and understand that we cannot stop our loved ones from getting sick or prevent our children from facing lifes hardships but we can do the best we can with the little we have. We can love God and one another and in so doing build better friendships, happier families, safer communities and ultimately a better nation.

The United States Army South has been working with the Office of Disaster Preparedness (ODPM) and its partner agencies to test the nation's plans for dealing with a major incident. \\\"While we are doing our part, you, too, have a role to play,\\\" Cox noted. \\\"We at the Ministry of National Security and ODPM have a saying: It begins with you and me.

ON CAMERA: Live CCTV video showing the airport, Parliament and St Clair at the National Operations Centre in Port of Spain, yesterday. Captured on camera. This is what National Security Minister Gary Griffith hopes to achieve with a now-functioning network of CCTV cameras that has been in active use since last October to monitor roads, highways and the activity of Trinidadians across the country. The network of CCTV cameras is already so extensive that it monitors thousands of drivers around the country as well as travellers entering and leaving the country from Piarco International Airport. The CCTV communications platform was unveiled yesterday during a tour of the recently launched National Operations Centre (NOC) at its Knowsley Building headquarters in Port of Spain. It was previously located in Riverside Plaza, Port of Spain. The NOC has become the national focal point for public safety and joint security operations in the country. It combines the country's law-enforcement and intelligence agencies, all operating under the same roof to monitor activities around the country by camera, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. NOC operations involve the Police Service, Fire Service, Defence Force and the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM). It is currently using the national CCTV initiative controlled by the police, which feeds real-time video into the NOC. The NOC also monitors rapid-response police vehicles to ensure they are operating within the zones to which they are assigned. Security monitoring will also increase shortly with the inclusion of video from national security helicopters. Data from the Coast Guard's coastal radar system is also being fed to the NOC, and a more direct link with video being channelled straight to the NOC is coming on stream to more effectively monitor the country's coastline. It will shortly include Customs, Immigration, the prisons system and members of the country's intelligence-gathering units. Invited journalists and publishers were yesterday given a tour of active operations at the NOC, which was established in the middle of last year but became operational in October. Leading the tour was Griffith, Communications Minister Gerald Hadeed and director of the NOC Commander Garvin Heerah. The NOC is still only five per cent complete at a cost of $2 million and will not have all systems 100 per cent operational until February 2015, Griffith explained. During the tour of the NOC's monitoring systems, it however became clear CCTV and law enforcement eyes are already covering the country extensively. Several desks were neatly arranged to face large, split-screen monitors which were running real-time video of a number of areas around the country. Vehicles speeding along the Beetham Highway were clearly visible while NOC law enforcement personnel also monitored CCTV video of people and cars at the Parliament building on the Port of Spain Waterfront, Laventille and San Juan. The NOC team also showed journalists passengers checking in for flights at Piarco and live pictures of them passing through security scanners before they boarded their flights. A statement handed out by the National Security Ministry said the NOC will be the single agency with an integrated nationwide system for coordination among the multiple arms of the national security apparatus. Minister Hadeed was more succinct, saying it will assist in solving crime, \\\"ensure (citizens') safety, your child's safety and the country's safety\\\". The NOC, which Griffith said replaced the National Security Operations Centre (NSOC), went into action during the blackout in West Trinidad that followed a sub-station fire at Westmoorings on Wednesday, he added. Griffith said the NOC was the communications platform between law-enforcement agencies, which sometimes took too long to share information or received inaccurate information. It is different from the now-defunct Special Anti-Crime Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (SAUTT), which \\\"was not always working with law-enforcement agencies\\\". \\\"The NOC will bring all agencies together,\\\" Griffith said, adding the NOC will monitor car accidents, traffic, criminal activities, natural disasters and stolen vehicles, among other issues. Law-enforcement agencies will be stationed at the NOC 24 hours a day, monitoring activities across the country, he added. What the NOC does: \\u2022 A platform for the integration of inter-agency operations and logistical support \\u2022 Facilitates the intelligence and information fusion pertaining to planned operations \\u2022 Integrates multi-source information into one platform to facilitate situational awareness on a 24/7 basis and information sharing \\u2022 Provides a planning facility where law-enforcement bodies can access technology and operational intelligence \\u2022 Manages an advisory system to alert services of any pending and existing threats that would be deemed to require a coordinated response \\u2022 Has a watch keeper from each law enforcement body stationed at the NOC on a 24/7 basis. -Source: Ministry of National Security TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

The mishaps of earlier this year were never adequately explained. There was a series of articles in this newspaper which seemed to suggest serious managerial deficiencies. The Oilfields Workers Trade Union vociferously added its voice to the call for Petrotrins management to own up. The real impact of the disaster up to now is not really known. Many citizens suspect the clean-up was not properly handled. So, the story has not yet reached a conclusion, not with so many unanswered questions. It is cause for concern when so many incidents happen in such a short space of time. I have come around to the school of thought that there are no true accidents; there are always underlying factors which contribute to unfortunate events. Sadly, at most times, it is only the dissection of an event that adds to our knowledge of preventing or lessening further occurrences. I am really surprised that, thus far, there has not been a comprehensive investigation into these incidents and, further, a revamping of Petrotrins entire safety structure. There can be no doubt something that is wrong. If such an exercise has indeed been undertaken, it should have been made public and transparent. It does our international reputation no good if we allow ourselves to be continually prone to so many accidents. It would seem the strategy of the Petrotrin management is blame everybody else. When the spills occurred last year in the Gulf of Paria, we heard allegations that seem tantamount to industrial sabotage! Now again, an audit is to be carried out by an outside entity, and employees were suspended pending that audit. I would think, though, whatever the shortcomings and wrongdoings of staff may be, the board should man up and accept that responsibility for these continued lapses rests with them.

Seecharan's home was one of 60 houses damaged or destroyed, according to chief executive officer of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM) Dr Stephen Ramroop. Seecharan recounted her escape on Thursday. \\\"I did not expect this kind of wind. The place was calm, I walked into my gallery and I began feeling the strong winds.

To remember the birth of a little child and to rejoice and celebrate because this little child is Emmanuel, God-with-us. This event is meant to fill us with great hope, not amnesia. This Eucharistic celebration of Christmas and the festive activities, which are all worthy of being enjoyed must not make us forget the situation which we as a nation live. If we do forget and do not let the events of the past year influence the way in which we celebrate, then we are like ostriches, hiding our heads in the sand, until of course, disaster strikes close to home. What are we called to remember We are called to remember the 390-odd murders committed during the past year. We are called to remember that 28 of those killed during the past year were under the age of 18 and therefore minors. We are called to remember that seven of those were under the age of 12, a jump of four over the past year. We are called to remember those whose lives were snuffed out in road accidents and those who lost everything because of flooding. The list can go on and on. It is tempting to ask, why remember these distressing statistics in this season of cheer and goodwill We must remember if we are to apply the Gospel message of this feast to the concrete situation that we live, so that we can let this message enlighten and transform us. The first reading of this Eucharistic celebration reminds us of the vision of the prophet Isaiah; The people that walked in darkness has seen a great light, on those who live in a land of deep shadow a light has shone. I know that it can and will be said that things are not as bad as they seem. There is much for which we have to thank Almighty God. That is true, but we could be thanking God for much more and I wonder if the parents, family and friends of those who have lost babies, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers are seeing much for which to thank God. If we are willing to see a light has shone upon us. God has sent his Son into the world so that our eyes may be opened for us to see the way to the happiness which we seek. That is why the good news given to the shepherds in the fields resonates in our hearts today and fills us with hope. Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For today in the city of David a saviour has been born for you who is Christ and Lord. The celebration of Christmas reminds us that we have the solution to all the problems that we face as a nation. We have to adopt the values of Jesus Christ, values which are found in the sacred writings of every religion and every Christian denomination. Our problem is the problem described by the John the Evangelist in the prologue to the gospel. He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him. The question for each one of us then is this: Have I accepted Jesus Have I made the values and the vision of Jesus my own My dear friends, the acceptance of Jesus brings with it certain obligations. As Jesus the Son was sent by the Father into the world to be a light shining in the darkness, so the acceptance of Jesus carries with it the recognition that we, too, have been sent to ensure that the light continues to shine in the darkness. My dear friends, the Letter to the Hebrews reminds us, In times past, God spoke in partial and various ways to our ancestors through the prophets; in these last days, he has spoken to us through the Son, God, however, continues to speak to us today and cries out to us in the tears of mothers and fathers, sons and daughters who bear the anguish of the loss of their loved ones. God calls on us, those of us who are here, those of us who frequent the sacraments, those of us who consider ourselves authentic disciples and good Christians, God calls on us to believe in his name and be light shining in the darkness which seems to envelop so much of our land. It is only through our lives that Emmanuel, God-with-us, will walk our land. It is only through our lives that real hope will be given to our people. I urge you, therefore, to be light to those who walk in the darkness of despair because their lives have been traumatised by vehicular accidents, violent crime, the murder of loved ones, the abuse of children. Over this Christmas season strive to be bearers of hope to them so that the message of peace may touch their hearts. This season of goodwill to all demands that we actively and profoundly share this goodwill. Let us not be ostriches hiding our heads in the sand, let us be disciples hearing the message of Christmas and taking it to the farthest corners of our land, especially to those who think that they have no reason to hope.

Yes, you read rightgas! I know the more enlightened in the country might think that Shah finally flipped his lid...he gone off. After all, if anything, for the sake of country, we need more gas. With a mere ten years of reserves available, we could use vast reservoirs of natural gas to sustain our economic lifeblood, not to add our elevated lifestyles. The gas that triggers panic among people and creates chaos in the country is the heavily subsidised fuel that powers our all-important \\\"rides\\\". A mere rumour of an impending shortage of gas (and here I include diesel), a whisper that oil workers are threatening to take strike action by Christmas or next Carnival, goes viral, as they say in computer-speak, triggering the most irrational, sub-human behaviour you cannot begin to imagine. It happened last week when many Petrotrin workers walked off the job for a day or two. The moment reports of the industrial action hit the airwaves, motorists headed straight for the nearest gas stations. It didn't matter that their vehicles were near-full or close to empty, the word \\\"gas\\\" sent them bazodee. Others who did not hear the news, but who saw the queues as they drove by, joined in, adding to the chaos. In a flash, there were traffic gridlocks across much of central and south Trinidad. Motorists spent hours in queues, punishing themselves and their vehicles, seeking gas. Predictably, stations started running out of fuels, forcing them to hastily scribble \\\"no gas\\\" signs. More panic! Mankind started hunting for gas. Mobile phones went hyperactive, and even the so-called \\\"social networks\\\" joined the chaos: where can we find gas Indeed, for more than 24 hours, that was all thousands of people didhunt for gas. Now, anyone with a modicum of common sense ought to know that it would take at least a week's shutdown of the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery to have an impact on the availability of fuels (including LPG). Petrotrin stores products in huge tanks, as does the main distributor, NP. I don't know what their storage capacity is, but I imagine they hold several weeks' supply between what they will have produced for export and for the local market. So outside of extended industrial action or some major disaster, nationals need not fear for fuel shortages. But try telling that to \\\"gas brains\\\" Trinis. OWTU's Ancel Roget could be walking the street following some lengthy meetings and saying his comrades, \\\"Boy, ah so hungry, ah have gas pains!\\\" Someone nearby overhears the operative word \\\"gas\\\", rumours spread, and before you know it, there's gridlock at gas stations. Let me put our stupidity another way. You know, if, based on empirical data, some minister or a supermarkets' spokesperson were to warn of impending shortages of critical food commodities, town would laugh it off Or when WASA advises of planned disruptions that would mean no potable water for an extended period, there is hardly a murmur from affected communities. But even a hint of low gas or no gas and panic sets in, animal behaviour takes over. The only other threat that comes close to creating the panic gas does is a tsunami warning. I guess after people saw television images of devastation in Japan and before that in Indonesia and other countries, mankind must be messing their drawers at the thought of a tsunami striking us. Luckily, last week's false warning that followed an earthquake in Costa Rica did not reach many people, so there was no panic. I dont't know how many people are aware that outside of the Caribbean being in an earthquake zone (hence the possibility of both major quakes and tsunamis), there are several seabed volcanoes that pose greater threats. Some years ago, I read about one such phenomenon, located across the Atlantic, closer to Europe. Scientists posit that if it erupts violently, it would send a virtual mountain of water hurtling at jet-speed towards the eastern coast of North America and the Caribbean. The consequences of a tsunami of that magnitude are better left unimagined. On the subjects of gas panic and tsunamis, I read where ODPM head Dr Stephen Ramroop said his organisation has in place an elaborate plan to evacuate people in Port of Spain and surrounding districts in the event of a tsunami. Ram spoke of people gathering in an orderly manner to board buses that would shuttle them to points on Lady Young Road and other elevated locations. Now, I don't know if Ram was hallucinating or otherwise out of sorts when he spoke with the reporter. The ODPM and associated agencies have proved to be woefully inadequate if not outright impotent in dealing with minor issuesflooding, a whirlwind here, a sinkhole there. Minor accidents on major arteries lead to hours of traffic pile-ups and hoggish road behaviour. People panic easily and turn trivial incidents into major disasters. So, be serious, Doc. Tell the people that if ever they are alerted to a tsunami, run like hell, hopefully for higher ground, and keep praying even as they shove aside the infirm, the aged, and maybe children. Tell them there is no plan, so they won't waste time waiting for transport that will never turn up. Should we ever face such horrendous threat, it would be a case of every man for himself. We panic, \\\"turn beast\\\" over the hint of a gas shortage, but you want to convince me that you have a tsunami plan in place Cut the bull, Doc. If ever a major disaster were to strike usa hurricane, a big quake, a tsunaminot even God would help. We are too stupid to merit His intervention.

Heavy and often constant rain in the past week, which on Thursday devastated acres of crops in Plum Mitan, is normal for this time of year as the seasons begin to change, the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Office has said. Yesterday, about an hour of fluctuating rain left hundreds of commuters battling for transport. People were forced to wait out the flash flooding that occurred downtown, on Independence Square and the environs as far as parts of Woodbrook, submerging the streets and sidewalks from around 2.30 p.m. to about 4 p.m.. In Barataria, the roundabout was under water for close to an hour, bringing traffic to a standstill at one point. Adding to the chaos, was a vehicular accident at the intersection of the Main Road and the Priority Bus Route in St Augustine, where the driver of a Nissan AD wagon was reported to have run into the traffic lights, causing the pole to collapse. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM), yesterday issued bulletins advising commuters to wait out the floods and to watch for swollen rivers and streams at the weekend. \\\"The heavy rainfall being experienced by Trinidad and Tobago is attributed to the passage of a low pressure system in the mid-Atlantic and has resulted in floods in western parts of Trinidad,\\\" the ODPM stated. \\\"Rainfall is expected to continue into the evening but will lessen in intensity in the next one-two hours.\\\" With regard to yesterday's commuters, the ODMP had advised: \\\"Citizens are therefore urged to delay transportation out of Port of Spain until flood waters have subsided.\\\" Anyone affected by floods may contact the ODPM's customer care centre at 511. \\\"First responders are on alert and the situation and the ODPM continues to monitor the situation. Trinidad and Tobago is currently not under any tropical storm threat, watch or warning,\\\" the office stated. Speaking to the Express via telephone yesterday, Meteorological Officer II, Albert Alexander, said the inclement weather is normal and is expected to subside by tomorrow. Alexander said April tends to be a month of in-between weather as the wet season approaches, though the intensity of the rain is a bit out of character. \\\"But by Monday we will get some sun and people will wonder if we have gone back into the dry season,\\\" Alexander said.

The Interior Ministry said at least 11 people were killed and five seriously injured. Amalia Tedeschi, a firefighter, told RAI state TV that some 20 vehicles, including cars and trucks, had been involved in the collapse of a stretch of bridge some 80 meters (260 meters) in length. She said two people had been pulled alive from vehicles in the rubble, which fell into an industrial area below the bridge. Officials said they were being transported by helicopter to a hospital. The Interior Ministry confirmed reports by the Italian news agency ANSA that 11 people were killed and five injured, adding that the number could increase.

(Luca Zennaro/ANSA via AP) The private broadcaster Sky TG24 said a 200-meter (over 650-foot) section of the Morandi Bridge collapsed over an industrial zone, sending tons of twisted steel and concrete debris onto warehouses below. Firefighters told The Associated Press they were worried about gas lines exploding in the area from the collapse. Photos published by ANSA on its website showed a huge gulf between two sections of the bridge. Video captured the sound of a man screaming: \\\"Oh God! Oh, God!\\\" Other images showed a green truck that had stopped just short of the gaping hole in the bridge and the tires of a tractor trailer in the rubble. ANSA said authorities suspected that a structural weakness had caused the collapse, but there was no immediate explanation by authorities for why they might have thought that or what had happened. Italy's transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, called the collapse \\\"an enormous tragedy.\\\" News agency ANSA said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will travel to Genoa later Tuesday. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said some 200 firefighters were responding to the accident. \\\"We are following minute by minute the situation of the bridge collapse in Genoa,\\\" Salvini said on Twitter. The disaster occurred on a highway that connects Italy to France, and northern cities like Milan to the beaches of Liguria. It came on the eve of a major Italian summer holiday on Wednesday called Ferragosto, which means traffic was heavier than usual as Italians traveled to beaches or mountains.

Mind you, it's also understandable that Mr Howai in particular and the Government in general have a very vested interest in putting a much brighter spin (\\\"spin\\\" being very much the operative word here) on what, at first glance, appears to be an economic disaster in the making. For I can tell you that after my initial reading of that report, I concluded it could only mean one of two things. Either (1) some accounting officers in our various ministries seem to believe they can do whatever they like with taxpayers' monies with absolutely no need for accountability or fear of reprisal or (2) some of the current crop of ministerial accounting officers are the most incompetent, inefficient, slipshod and carelessly indifferent bunch we have ever employed in our 51 years of Independence. The $6.8 million paid to a wrecking company to recover a fire truck, which originally cost $2 million, that had skidded off a cliff\\u2014and video recordings of that accident have shown that the truck was hardly more than 40 to 60 feet downhill and not the 300 feet that is being otherwise claimed\\u2014and which has agitated public opinion of late might in fact simply be part of a pattern, identified as \\\"overpayments\\\", in the Auditor General's report. Last week the Prime Minister admitted the firetruck tugout fee was \\\"a fiasco\\\", a word that is becoming increasingly associated with her Government. You wonder what words she might use to describe some of the revelations in the Auditor General's report. For example, it points to 5,280 cases of \\\"overpayments\\\", totalling $20.3 million in 2011, of which just $8.4 million was recovered. For 2012 another 4,531 cases of \\\"overpayments\\\" were reported, totalling $21.4 million, of which just over $8 million was recovered. The word \\\"overpayment\\\" itself may simply be an euphemism for blatant bobol. A contractor sends in a bill for $2 million and you pay him $5 million, with the clear understanding that a sizeable portion of the \\\"overpayment\\\" is to be returned, or \\\"kicked back\\\", to the original source. In short, plain \\\"tiefing\\\". The report also cites a lack of documents to verify millions in expenditure by some Government ministries. Requests for more specific information on Government expenditure were simply repeatedly ignored. Apart from being very upbeat about the state of the economy, Mr Howai has since told us most of those reports were eventually handed in but too late to be included in the published report. There's been no mention though or explanation of the some $25.3 million in outstanding \\\"overpayments\\\". Mr Howai will pardon me if I say so but it also occurred to me that legendary robbers like Robin Hood and his Merry Men or Ali Baba and his 40 Thieves would blush green with envy after reading this report. Mr Howai tells us \\\"steps are being taken to address issues raised\\\" in the report. An official release said: \\\"Even as he expressed concern over the findings of the...report and the fact that it reflects very little improvement over prior years, the minister said he had been working with the Comptroller of Accounts...and she has been actively pursuing the correction of the errors and irregularities identified with the various ministries.\\\" So will the next Auditor General's report show an improvement in the state of the Government's finances I strongly doubt it. You don't have to be an economics genius to understand that at the rate this is going, unless some very drastic action is taken, and soon, to halt the slide we are heading for at best financial chaos, at worst bankruptcy and the proverbial poor house. For sure any private company being run along these lines won't be in business for very long. I've also heard several apologists for this Government argue since the publication of this report that under previous PNM regimes the corruption was worse and on a more massive scale. But that is surely just a rationalisation and an excuse. It is definitely not solution to the problem. Bear in mind that this country's economy is largely bolstered by two wasting assets\\u2014oil and gas. The day we run short or out of one or both of them we will find ourselves up the proverbial creek without a paddle. And if you think that the crime situation in this country is bad today, you wouldn't like to imagine what it would be like then. Discussing this issue with a former senior public servant last week, he agreed with me that the report's findings were atrocious, requiring urgent resolution. As to coping with the kind of economic crisis portended here, his comment was: \\\"I only hope by the time we get there, I will be long dead and gone.\\\" Sad. But a very realistic response to what no amount of \\\"spin\\\" will then be able to make palatable. Mark my word!

Television footage showed the mangled wreckage of the C-130 Hercules, a crumpled burning car and a shattered building that local media said was recently built and contained a spa, shops and homes. Smoke billowed from the site and several thousand people milled nearby. Rescue teams scrambled over the rubble, searching for any survivors. Air force chief Air Marshall Agus Supriatna said 49 bodies have been recovered and taken to Medan's Adam Malik hospital. He said there is unlikely to be any survivors. The plane's manifest showed there were 50 people on the flight from Medan to the remote Natuna island chain, according to North Sumatra police chief Eko Hadi Sutedjo, but the actual number might be higher. Supriatna said there were 12 crew and more than 100 passengers on the plane before it reached Medan on Sumatra, one of Indonesia's main islands. It had traveled from the capital, Jakarta, and stopped at two locations before arriving at Medan. The air force is trying to determine how many people got off or boarded during that journey. Many passengers were families of military personnel. Hitching rides on military planes to reach remote destinations is common in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago that spans three time zones. Indonesia has a patchy civil aviation safety record and its cash-strapped air force has also suffered a string of accidents. Between 2007 and 2009, the European Union barred Indonesian airlines from flying to Europe because of safety concerns. The country's most recent civilian airline disaster was in December, when an AirAsia jet with 162 people on board crashed into the Java Sea en route from Surabaya to Singapore. There have been five fatal crashes involving air force planes since 2008, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aviation disasters. The crash of the transport plane, which had been in service since 1964, occurred not long before midday and just two minutes after it took off from Soewondo air force base. Supriatna, the air force chief, said the pilot told the control tower that the plane needed to turn back because of engine trouble. \\\"The plane crashed while it was turning right to return to the airport,\\\" he said. Medan resident Fahmi Sembiring said he saw the gray Hercules flying very low as he was driving. \\\"Flames and black smoke were coming from the plane in the air,\\\" he said. Sembiring said he stopped not far from the crash site and saw several people rescued by police, security guards and bystanders. Another man, Janson Halomoan Sinagam, said several of his relatives were on the plane when it left Medan. \\\"We just want to know their fate,\\\" he told MetroTV, weeping. \\\"But we have not yet received any information from the hospital.\\\" The C-130 accident is the second time in 10 years that an airplane has crashed into a Medan neighborhood. In September 2005, a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a crowded residential community shortly after takeoff from Medan's Polonia airport, killing 143 people including 30 on the ground. Medan, with about 3.4 million people, is the third most populous city in Indonesia after Jakarta and Surabaya. On Twitter, President Joko \\\"Jokowi\\\" Widodo said he and his family extend \\\"heartfelt condolences\\\" to the families of victims. After the emergency response is complete, the government will evaluate the age of air force planes and other important military equipment, he said. Aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said numerous nonfatal accidents involving air force planes this year are worrying and suggest there could be shortfalls in areas such as training. Previously, the air force's safety record was marred by low flight hours and parts shortages that stemmed from a U.S. ban on defense sales to Indonesia, but that situation no longer applies with the lifting of those restrictions more than five years ago.

But many of those who chose to stay at home could have told them what would happen. A novel entertainment event that was free to the public, heavily promoted, and that was held in Chaguaramas, with one road in and one road out, was bound to cause a massive traffic jam. To add to the size of the problem, the Flugtag event was held on the same day as the traditional St Peter's Day festival celebrated annually by Carenage fishermen and residents. Yet the authorities were unable to foresee the traffic pile-up and took inadequate steps to deal with it. The only precaution taken in advance by the police was to ban parking along the Western Main Road from Glencoe. Meanwhile, the event organisers merely suggested that spectators car-pool, and promised \\\"sufficient\\\" parking in Chaguaramas itself. From early morning yesterday, however, there were reports and photographs on the social media of lines of cars backing up along the Mucurapo foreshore and Wrightson Road. Residents from as far east as St James suffered distress and inconvenience as they were unable to get out of their homes because of the unmoving traffic that blocked the streets. There were obvious ways to avoid or alleviate this crush. The organisers should have offered park-and-ride options to ferry spectators west from the city by bus and to charter water-taxis from Port of Spain and San Fernando. This was not an unexpected natural disaster, but an organised occasion that had been scheduled months before. The authorities have no excuse for being unprepared. Even in the case of natural disaster, however, there should be plans in place. It has been six years since a Works and Transport Minister promised an emergency evacuation plan for Port of Spain, after gridlock paralysed the capital as a tropical storm approached. Yet no plan to allow an orderly exodus has been made public to date. Instead, in recent months, heavy rains have caused floods that forced thousands of commuters to walk home from the cityan option which was far from ideal and which would not be possible if a major storm actually struck. Even accidents can cause traffic snarl-ups in which thousands of people are trapped. An overturned tanker on the Solomon Hochoy Highway last month caused a back-up that was allowed to continue unnecessarily for five hours. Yesterday's incident flags once again the need for proper traffic management for such events. Traffic jams of that nature are entirely predictable. They are not inevitableand they are certainly not acceptable.

He added: Its disorienting, its literally unspeakable there are no words for expressing the total loss. ? 1:40 p.m. (1240 GMT, 8:40 a.m. EDT) The parents of 37-year-old Robert Oliver, one of the three American citizens killed in the Germanwings crash, say they are finding solace in memories of their son. ?Instead of focusing our minds and hearts on those last nine or 10 minutes (of the flight), we prefer to think about those 37 years that weve been together, father Robert Oliver Calvo said. He told reporters in Barcelona that he feels no anger toward co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, accused of crashing the Airbus A320 into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. ?Im really sad for those parents of that young pilot. I cant imagine what theyre going through right now, he said. Robert Oliver worked for a clothing company in Barcelona, where his parents also live. ? 12:45 p.m. (1145 GMT, 7:45 a.m. EDT) German prosecutors say they have found evidence that the co-pilot of the Germanwings plan which crashed in the French Alps appears to have hidden evidence of an illness from his employers. Prosecutors in the western city of Duesseldorf say they seized medical documents from the home of Andreas Lubitz that indicate an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment. Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in a statement Friday that torn-up sick notes for the day of the crash support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues. He said the search of Lubitzs home revealed no suicide note or evidence of any political or religious motivation for his actions. ? 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT, 7:30 a.m. EDT) Three Kazakhs who perished in the Germanwings flight were on a European vacation when they made a spur-of-the-moment decision to go to Spain to watch one of soccers most popular matches. The vacation to Europe was precious time together for Kazakh couple Erbol Imankulov and his wife Aizhan Isengaliyeva, after he recently moved 700 kilometers (400 miles) from his home city of Ust-Kamenogorsk to take up a job in the coal city of Karaganda. The diversion to go watch El Clasico on Sunday between Barcelona and Real Madrid was a special treat for their 26-year old son, Adil, who was travelling with them. All three Kazakhs perished in the Germanwings crash from Barcelona to Duesseldorf that killed 150 people on Tuesday. Adils sister, 14-year-old Diana, missed out on the trip. She was unable to get a visa. The co-pilot is suspected of intentionally crashing the plane into a mountain in the French Alps during the Barcelona to Duesseldorf flight. ? 11:50 a.m. (1050 GMT, 6:50 a.m. EDT) Frances leading pilots union is filing a lawsuit over leaks about the investigation into the Germanwings crash. Guillaume Schmid, a representative of the SNPL union, said Friday that pilots are angry that information about the dramatic final moments of the flight were reported in the media before prosecutors and others were informed. After the media reports, a prosecutor announced that cockpit recordings indicate the co-pilot of the Germanwings A320 jet intentionally flew the plane into a mountain on Tuesday. All 150 aboard were killed. The lawsuit is over violating a French law on keeping information about investigations secret while they are ongoing. The lawsuit doesnt name an alleged perpetrator, a common method in French law that leaves it to investigators to determine who is at fault. Schmid said that pilots are saddened by the accident and understand the publics wish for immediate information, but decried pressure on investigators and said that can lead to misleading the public instead. ? 11:30 a.m. (1030 GMT, 6:30 a.m. EDT) Germanys president has attended a memorial service in the western town of Haltern for 16 students and two teachers from the local high school who were killed in the Germanwings plane crash. President Joachim Gauck and North Rhine-Westphalias state governor, Hannelore Kraft, attended the service along with students at the towns St. Sixtus church. Investigators believe Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked himself alone in the cockpit during Tuesdays flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, and then intentionally crashed the plane into a mountainside in the southern French Alps. All 150 people aboard the plane were killed. ? 10:25 a.m. (0925 GMT, 5:25 a.m. EDT) Germanwings says it is setting up a family assistance center in Marseille for relatives of the 150 people killed when one of its planes crashed in the French Alps. Investigators believe Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz intentionally crashed the plane into a mountainside during Tuesdays flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said in a statement that in these dark hours our full attention belongs to the emotional support of the relatives and friends of the victims of Flight 9525. The airline, a subsidiary of German carrier Lufthansa, says some grieving relatives took part in a religious service Thursday afternoon near the crash site. ? 9:50 a.m. (0850 GMT, 4:50 a.m. EDT) Frances prime minister has called on German airline Lufthansa to provide all information about Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who investigators believe intentionally slammed a plane into a French mountainside, killing all 150 people aboard. Prime Minister Manuel Valls called on Lufthansa to give the maximum of information so that we can understand why this pilot got to the point of this horrific action. In an interview with French network iTele, Valls said Friday that nothing would be ruled out until the end of a full investigation. The Germanwings flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf crashed Tuesday in the southern French Alps. Germanwings is a division of Lufthansa. ?

Leela Ramdeen In 1995 Pope St John Paul II stated: \\u201cThe value of democracy stands or falls with the truths and values which it embodies and promotes.\\u201d What are the values that define us as a people? Years ago the Catholic Commission for Social Justice (CCSJ) worked with some principals and teachers in Catholic primary schools to develop a values and virtues formation programme. The handbook and teachers\\u2019 guide are available on our website. The then archbishop, Edward Gilbert, stated at the launch of the programme that to promote authentic integral human development, that is, the development of each person, and of every dimension of the person, we need to teach young people about \\u201cvalues, virtues, morality and personal and social relationships\\u201d, in order to form their consciences and build their character. Have some of us lost our moral compass? My heart was filled with sadness when I read some of the negative comments on social media following the disaster at sea when a boat capsized on its way from Venezuela to Trinidad on April 23. The media reported that at least 23 people were reported missing when the fishing pirogue carrying 34 persons overturned on Tuesday night near Patos Island, near the Dragon\\u2019s Mouth, after experiencing engine problems. Eleven persons were rescued. The body of one of them, that of a woman, was recovered on Friday morning by divers searching near the overturned boat in the Gulf of Paria. Her body was returned to her waiting family members in Guiria, Venezuela. The negative comments made by some T&T citizens following this tragedy brought to mind the words of the Japanese writer, Daisaku Ikeda: \\u201cThere are no greater treasures than the highest human qualities such as compassion, courage and hope. Not even tragic accident or disaster can destroy such treasures of the heart.\\u201d Have some of us lost the great treasure of \\u201ccompassion\\u201d? Nelson Mandela reminded us that \\u201cour human compassion binds us the one to the other.\\u201d We need to nurture in our people virtues and values that will \\u201canimate\\u201d love, compassion and respect for each other. We all have a role to play in transforming our society so that it will reflect the kind of values and virtues that will help us to build the common good, that is, to create conditions so that everyone can flourish. Carolyn Kissoon reported that comments shared on the Express Facebook site following this \\u201ctragedy at sea ranged from anguish and sympathy, to celebration by some happy that the Venezuelans had not been able to get to Trinidad.\\u201d Here are a few of the negative comments: \\u201cStay in yuh country... Yes 33 less Vene in we country... Let this be a message to others who plan on coming stay in ulyuh country who vex loss... A lesson to be learnt...Stay in your blasted country.\\u201d I weep for my countrymen/women who harbour such dreadful thoughts. It was St Teresa of Calcutta who said: \\u201cIf we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.\\u201d Yes, my brothers and sisters, we are all made in the image and likeness of God; we belong to each other, and we have a responsibility to reach out to those in need. Sadly, as Pope Francis suggested in January 2019, hostility towards migrants is driven by irrational fear. He said: \\u201cIt is the fear that makes us crazy.\\u201d In February 2017 he reminded us that \\u201cprotecting the world\\u2019s migrants and refugees is a moral imperative.\\u201d Other faith leaders have also spoken out about the need for compassion in today\\u2019s world. For example, the Dalai Lama has said: \\u201cLove and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.\\u201d Archbishop Jason Gordon has identified \\u201chospitality\\u201d as one of the priorities in our archdiocese. During Lent he urged us to see \\u201cthe positive effects of practising hospitality daily.\\u201d He said: \\u201cHospitality is recognising the need of others. Let us reach out to those in need...\\u201d We do not journey through life in isolation from each other. We are social beings who are interconnected and interdependent.

He argued that the exorbitant bill was less than what would have been incurred in legal fees had it not been paid. I do not know where the Minister is obtaining legal advice on the question of costs and damages from but his justification is entirely flawed. In many respects the statements that have emanated from both Minister Roberts and former minister Jack Warner on the matter are reminiscent of those made by then minister of sport Gary Hunt on the payment of $2 million for installing a flag at the Hasely Crawford Stadium in 2009. Mr Hunt's declaration in defence of the expenditure \\u2014 \\\"There is no price too high to pay for national pride\\\" \\u2014 incurred the ire of the country and many were further angered when he stated his intention to put up similar flags in all the stadiums. Fortunately we were spared that waste when the PNM was removed from Government the following year. Now we have similar bravado attempts at justifying what, based on logic alone, is an astronomical fee for towing services, whether they necessitated the use of one, two or even three cranes. The undisputed facts are that the fire tender, bought in 2006 at a cost of $2.2 million, on November 17 last skidded and ran off the road in the Blanchisseuse area and plunged off a cliff. Four fire fighters in the truck were rescued and escaped serious injury. A Junior Sammy subsidiary, Sammy's Multilift Services, was hired to retrieve the appliance. It appears that on November 22, only five days after the accident, the then acting chief fire officer submitted the quotation for the works to the then minister of national security. The latter took the note to Cabinet, which eventually approved the sum of $6.8 million for payment. There is some dispute as to whether the job took two days or four and whether the precipice was in fact 300 feet deep or even 100 feet. An official of the company is quoted as saying, \\\"It took us four days. We used modular trailers and we had other mobile equipment that was used to minimise traffic. We had about 25 people on site who literally camped out there.\\\" In contrast, a report dated November 22 and sent to permanent secretary in the National Security Ministry by the former chief fire officer said the job was completed two days after the accident. The report also stated that the fire tender had come to \\\"rest approximately 15 metres down the precipice.\\\" Fifteen metres is about 50 feet. It is true that Cabinet can itself approve some contracts without recourse to the Central Tenders Board even for amounts in excess of $2 million. Section 20A of the Central Tenders Board Act allows the Government to act on its own behalf in some circumstances. These include where there is a natural disaster and the minister is of the opinion that an emergency situation has arisen where there is need for abatement or alleviation necessitating the undertaking of immediate works or services by the government. In approving the bill for the $6 million-plus payment Cabinet may have acted under this section. Some reasons have been put out for the payment of the exorbitant fee. The current Minister of National Security is reported as saying, in effect, that if your vehicle got into an accident and capsised the first thing you would want to do is get your vehicle out. Of course you would, and you would personally pay the towing fee \\u2014 but not if it exceeded the cost of the vehicle. Should the situation be any different when it is State monies Former minister Warner has said it is well and good to talk about what should have been done after the accident \\u2014 as he sought to argue that there was urgency in retrieving the truck, which he said, was blocking a ravine and damaging the environment. Everything Mr Warner says might be true but this does not tell us whether enquiries were made of Multilift Services at the time as to the anticipated cost of the job. No one was in the truck when it was towed. It was not then a matter of life and death calling for immediate action, regardless of the cost. Surely the truck could have stayed where it was for another day or two while the ministry staff made some calls as to the probable cost of the job. That seems only common sense to me. Yet Mr Warner has said he would do it again if he had to \\u2014 even in the face of reports that other experienced towing companies have said at most the job would cost about $50,000. Shades of Gary Hunt all over again. And Anil Roberts is bold-faced enough to claim that because the job was done it had to be paid for. So if you took your $200,000 car for repairs and the bill was $1 million would you be obliged to pay it I think not and I know for a fact that in respect of many small contractors the State has either beat down their quotes or refrained from paying for months on end. As for the contention that Cabinet had no choice since they would be faced with a lawsuit \\u2014 since when has this Government been afraid of being sued Finally, on what basis does Anil Roberts conclude that the Government would \\\"lose\\\" if they had gone to court Does he know something we don't about the terms agreed to before the job was done * Dana S Seetahal is a former Independent Senator TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

The first phase of the National Transport Management System (NTMS) will focus on the East-West Corridor, and is geared at reducing traffic congestion. Canadian company IBI Group, which specialises in Intelligent Transportation Systems, was awarded a $42 million three-year contract, by the National Infrastructural Development Company (Nidco) to organise and implement the programme, on behalf of the Ministry of Works and Transport. The NTMS is an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) that comprises the Corridor Traffic Management System (CTMS), Traffic Surveillance and Control Systems (TSCS), and the National Traffic Management Centre (NTMC). ITS is the application of advanced and emerging technology in transportation to save time, money, energy and the environment using computers, sensors, information systems, software, communications and electronic devices. The system's aims, in this first phase, are to mitigate the traffic congestion along the East-West Corridor. According to Navin Ramsingh, the programme's project manager, this area has the highest traffic density and congestion in the country, with over 3,000 cars travelling along it daily. Ministry permanent secretary Cheryl Blackman said that the programme was Information Technology-driven and geared towards improving traffic flow, as well as help law enforcement better monitor roads. NIDCO president, Dr Carson Charles, said the aim was to ensure the travelling public is given the level of service and technology it deserves. Benefits of the system include improved travel times; increased travel speeds on the highway during peak times; and quicker response by emergency and law enforcement during crises. The improved flow of traffic will also mean less police time dedicated to traffic management, and diverted to other more pressing duties. The NTMS will also aid in planning for emergencies and evacuations of Port-of-Spain in the event of any type of disasters. The NTMC is the central monitoring room for the system. Located on the second floor of the Ministry's headquarters and designed by IBI Group, it is a state-of-the-art space that can remotely control the various technologies utilised by the system. It is fitted with six screens that simultaneously monitor different areas along the corridor in real time. The CTMS involves 10 CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras with pan/tilt/zoom features for a 360-degree view of the corridor. It also has 16 vehicle detection stations to monitor the average speed of traffic. There will also be two Variable Message Signs (already installed on the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway ) to provide updates from the Ministry about traffic conditions or accidents so commuters can decide if they need to take alternative routes. The TSCS will monitor traffic lights and signals. It can be controlled remotely by the NTMC, who can modify them according to the flow and density of traffic. Works and Transport Minister Jack Warner said that he would soon be taking a note to Cabinet to approve the formation of a National Incident Management Team comprising law enforcement, emergency response personnel and traffic personnel. They will meet monthly to discuss how best to improve and shorten response time. This is part of the Ministry's plan to create three incident management programmes: The Motorist Assistance Programme; Rapid Freeway Clearance Programme; and Mobility Response Team.

Absent any evident natural disaster or plant accident, or incident, something like a worst-case scenario inexplicably took effect. Power-hungry households, businesses, industries, utilities, and sundry facilities were starved of vital electricity supply. The impact of a total blackout in the wee hours of the morning was such as to propel Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar out of bed to assume the position of personally observing the response of operatives at the Penal PowerGen plant. She later ordered a full report on just what had gone wrong and why, and how a recurrence can be prevented. An Energy Ministry release pointed to an expected meeting of all the major entities involved in providing power to the nation... to troubleshoot what had taken place. In the known story so far, some indeterminate something went wrong at the Point Lisas facility of Phoenix Park Gas Processors, an entity 51 per cent owned by State enterprise NGC. The effect was somehow to stop the flow of cleaned-up natural gas to power generators and to downstream industrial operations. But a double, or triple, whammy was to come: NGCs back-up, gas-enabling, redundancies just failed to respond in their hour of need. Moreover, the new power plant, installed by NGC, on Tobagos Cove Estate, also stumbled and fell down. If and how the Cove mishap in eastern Tobago was connected with the unpredictable fiascoes at Phoenix Park and at NGC on Trinidads west coast has yet to be clarified. What stands revealed, however, is the demonstrated reality that, in its all-important natural gas production, supply and utilisation industry, all of the republic of Trinidad and Tobago had suddenly been reduced to the rule of Murphys Law. Thus, everything that could go wrong on Friday morning apparently did go wrong. That turn of events, witnessed worldwide, flies in the face of T&Ts self-image as an accomplished player on the energy field. On that basis, this country has been offering expert services to emerging natural gas-producing countries in Africa. A single episode, even one as extreme as Fridays, should not disrupt long-settled recognition of where T&T stands in the world of energy. Energy Minister Kevin Ramnarine last year hailed Phoenix Parks distinguished safety record, which he described as a key element in attracting external investors to the company. Phoenix Park and NGC will likely rise from the ashes of world reputation likely incurred on Friday. But the trauma of countrywide power outage, at least until causes are known,will likely have a wide-ranging and lingering impact in T&T which endured it.

Everyone seems to be quite aware of this, with the distinct exception of the sorry pack of individuals who call themselves politicians. These issues need not be elucidated upon here, in the interest of space; perhaps why they continue is of more interest. Upon close examination we recognise that the people with the visions of grandeur have one common policy, namely they continue to live in denial. By being in constant denial, they continue to insult citizens' intelligence, attributing every issue to opposition politics. We can begin with fireproof Martin Joseph who denies that we have a crime problem, despite numbers to the contrary. They use numbers to seek to baffle us; telling us how many \\\"patrols they conducted, how many tickets were issued, and how many exercises they undertook.'' Yet they never defined \\\"a patrol''. Is it that each time we see a police vehicle we can assume they are on patrol How does that explain when a victim in Pinto Road stopped a vehicle and told them he was robbed, they advised him to go to the Arima station while they continued on their merry way, with A/C blowing Or when they pass accidents and their victims on the nation's highways without the slightest effort to ascertain or assist FYI, Mr Joseph, people are not reporting many crimes today because we have no confidence in the police. Please don't take the lack of reports to believe that it is down. Check the murder rate and you will see. And then there's Health Minister Jerry Narace. Up to this day he has maintained that dengue is not a problem. So when he tells us that \\\"T&T is ready for the swine flu''. He and his gang are probably the only ones who believe this, if they actually do. Everyone with whom I have spoken expressed concerns to the contrary and rightly so. When we learn that people are sleeping on hospital floors for several nights before being placed in a room, it is a safe indicator that T&T is not ready for anything, least of all swine flu. Don't tell us how many vaccines there are at Mt Hopeless. Similarly, the good folks at Office of Disaster Preparedness Management, are another case in point. These goodly folks tell us that they are ready for any eventualities (LOL). Five minutes rain in Port of Spain and we know otherwise. Also, many of us were under the impression that the economy was really based on, among other things, oil prices. Energy Minister Conrad Enill had to put us in our place by telling us it was based on gas. So the drop in oil prices had no effect on the \\\"jillion'' dollar budget; consequently, there was no need to scale back on any of their mega projects--cost overruns and all. And the bills for the summit keeps coming in. And of course there's Karen Nunez-Tesheira, Minister of Finance, who I've noted is always pointing a finger, telling us that the global financial concerns are nothing to be really worried about. Of course if all our monies were protected a la Cyril Lawrence we would probably see things in a similar light. We might even roll over and be happy. Then there is President Max Richards who did no wrong. This list can go on to name all the others who live in denial. Thus when we see individuals violating laws of the land, whether it's driving on the PBR unauthorised, flying low on the shoulders of the highways, beating our women, leasing or renting firearms with the option to own, rest assured that they are only following the leader, as I believe Machel Montano said.

Some 300 yards up Moraldo Street, a two-woman delegation of Donna Maria Diaz and Meena St Louis welcome a reporter and photographer to share a community sense of impending peril. The source of their alarm is a chenette tree, thrusting straight up some 60 or 70 feet from an embankment at the edge of St Louis' front yard. The tree rises over two neighbours' adjacent houses. \\\"The sweetest chenette in Trinidad come from this tree,\\\" said St Louis of the fruit it bore last July-August. But the tree is dying. It can fall at any time, and it's tall enough to worry not just occupants of the tall-pillared house in the yard, but also householders nearby. Such as Diaz, who lives across the narrow street in a smaller, low house, with her mother and her teenage daughter. \\\"A branch fall last month from quite on top,\\\" said St Louis, who has lived under it for 43 of her 65 years. \\\"In the night, you sleeping, and rain fall heavy, it scary. What about when it fall on me\\\" said Diaz. To an unclued eye, the tree looks neither shaky nor terminally ill. Rather than spreading, its branches cluster upward from the trunk, in a shape resembling a brush for shaving or dusting. But Diaz and St Louis point to the base of the trunk, where the wood looks rotted. Diaz reads the clipping of an October 12 Express report that a Laventille family of seven were left homeless after a mango tree crashed onto their house. \\\"If this tree fall on my little old house, who going to compensate me\\\" Residents want this trouble tree cut down. On October 19, thirty-six residents signed a letter requesting this, that went to TSTT, T&TEC, the Diego Martin Regional Corporation. The tree ismore than 100 years old, Diaz and St Louis believe. \\\"I born and meet that tree big,\\\" said Norma Diaz, mother of Donna. She was born 74 years ago,right on the spot now threatened by the tree. In her house, immediately next door to St Louis, the chenette tree also directly overhead, Myrtle O'Brien, 63,treats the fall of the tree with grim humour: \\\"I am not afraid the tree fall on meagain. It fall on me already. I feeling it.\\\" For Colm Imbert, area MP and former works minister, the tree is fresh in mind as a constituency cause going back \\\"more than ten years.\\\" He had tried to help. \\\"These efforts have always come up against an obstacle,\\\" he said, choosing his words carefully. All had once been set for a tree cutting and, for safety, T&TEC disconnected power. One resident, however, \\\"threatened violence on the ground that meat in her fridge was spoiling\\\". T&TEC reconnected and retreated. The chenette tree survived. Neighbourhood fears revive with every season of wind and rain, and every news story of a tree falling on houses. Is the tree, century-old source of sweetest chenette, really also a continuing danger to property and maybe life \\\"Yes,\\\" says botanist and columnist Julian Kenny who, at the request of the Express, inspected the Moraldo Street ground zero. \\\"It really ought to come down,\\\" he said, agreeing with the residents' 100-year age estimate. \\\"Having it there is asking for a serious accident.\\\" Prof Kenny diagnosed a fatal weakening from age, worsened by a giant Strangler Fig parasite whose thick roots are sucking life out of the chenette tree'strunk. Preventing a fallen-tree disaster from happening is harder than it seems. The problem literally stands inside the fenced front yard ofSt Louis, a widowed pensioner. \\\"The Forestry Division say they don't cut down trees on private property. I bring plenty people here to look at it.\\\" St Louis can't afford the cost, estimated as high as $10,000, of forestalling danger to private and public property. The chenette tree story is immediately familiar to Councillor Nadia Romany of the Diego Martin Regional Corporation, recalling a letter from a fearful neighbour. Her corporation is \\\"trying to form a tree-cutting team,\\\" she said. Meanwhile, should this tree qualify as an \\\"emergency,\\\" the corporation would refer it to the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management. Until that determination, Councillor Romany said, removing a tree troubling to residents can be done only \\\"at a cost to burgessesto those who want it cut\\\".

SIX-TIME CHAMP: Colin Ramasra Toshiyuki Kato, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs speaking to reporters in his Tokyo office. Toshiyuki Kato, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs was fairly blunt when I asked him about China's higher economic presence and its agressive and assertive role in the Caribbean when campared with Japan. What exactly was Japan's foreign policy interest in this region \\\"First of all I want to emphasise that there is no lack of interest on the part of Japan in the Caribbean region and in Caribbean countries. But the China Government way of providing support and aid in what form and what kinds of purpose or objective they have in mind for providing support, are very different from the Japanese Government. Because it is become very clear that the China Government would like to provide aid and support with two purposes in mind one to secure resources, especially natural resources for their population and China has a huge population of more than $1.3 billion. So in order to secure the future for that large population, they would need some kind of insurance and the resources are that insurance. \\\"The second purpose is to have a larger, stronger voice in the international community,\\\" Kato said. \\\"All over the world China is making gifts and presents to different countries in the form of monument-like buildings and structures. But in building such structures, tens of thousands of Chinese workers are being sent in. \\\"On the other hand Japan works in a different way. Japan in principle hires local people in order to be engage in such projects with a view to providing education and vocational training to upgrade the skills of the local people so technical skills and guidance are being given. At the end of the training the local people can have skills in manufacturing or production,\\\" he said. My Venezuelan colleague followed up on the question, but Kato maintained his stance, saying: \\\"We have no intention of competing with China. Of course there may be some situations where we would have to face China as a competitor but we don't intend to compete with China. China is China and Japan is Japan\\\". But he emphasised that Japan was on a major drive to reach out to the international community, whose support it so greatly appreciated, in the aftermath of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami disaster. \\\"We want to emphasise kizuna (a Japanese word meaning bond), not only (the bond) at the level of the family and community but at the international level...Because we received support from the rest of the world, the Government wanted to show the world that the survivors (of the disaster) can get back on the feet again. We are making a point to the international community that even if you face tragic experiences, if you work hard, you can get back on your feet again,\\\" Kato said as he sat down to speak to our group which consisted of ten journalists. Japan has all reason to open up to the international community as it seeks to recover not only from the earthquake/tsunami disaster of March 11, 2010 (which triggered a nuclear power station accident at the Fukushima plant) but also as it seeks to rebuild the economy amidst global financial market instability. Part of the mission of reconstruction is to prevent the spread of \\\"reputation damage\\\" and restore faith in the \\\"Japan brand\\\" by emphasising that its products are of a high quality and are safe trhough the dissemination of \\\"accurate information\\\". Japanese officials, were very sensitive to the fact that the nuclear fallout at Fukushima has produced international fear \\\"that everything made in Japan was contaminated\\\". \\\"We are trying to rectify such a wrong image. We have been using every opportunity to emphasise the point that things coming out of Japan are safe, and that there are stringent safety standards supported by international data\\\", Kato said. After 3/11 there were import restrictions on Japanese food products, especially those coming from the Tohoku (the region most affected by the nuclear fallout). Japan asked its trade partners to lift these restrictions but only Canada and Chile compiled with the request. But, it recognises that once import restrictions are introduced, it is an uphill battle to reverse this decision. Government officials stress that Japanese people are some of the most sensitive in terms of food safety issue and that all food distributed and circulated in the international market from Japan is safe. (Fishes are however not safe and the Government has placed a ban on all fishing.) We were taken to places where the \\\"rigorous testing\\\" of food and products is done. At Yokohama Port, we were shown how they measured, using a radioactive meter, all containers passing through that Port. \\\"Out of 150,000 containers measures at the Port, only 17 required decontamination, we were told. The Port is in the process of installing an automated testing system at a cost of one billion yen. Meanwhile radiation measurement on food grown in the disaster affected region is conducted at the Agricultural Safety Promotion Department of the Fukushima Agricultural Technology Centre. The Department which opened in June 2011, tests all beef cattle as well as raw materials such as feed from the Fukushama region. There was a ban on all beef from Fukushama but it was lifted in September 2011. Still the radiation fears due to \\\"negative rumours\\\" have led to a 40 per cent drop in the price of beef because of the lower demand, officials revealed. The Government has sought to compensate farmers, buying at a cost of (US$1 billion) all the beef which could not be shipped and it has also paid for feed (at a cost of US$1.6 billion). One of Japan's primary contacts with the world is the motor car industry. And most of the cars coming to the Caribbean and Latin America were shipped directly from Japan. We visited Toyota Corporation's Toyko office and Masami Doi, Project General Manager Public Affairs Division explained why shipments to the Caribbean and Latin America were interrupted during the 3/11 disaster. Toyota has three factories in the disaster affected region of Tohoku. \\\"Mr Toyota ordered us to stop the automobile production line immediately after the earthquake becasue it would have meant that the workers at Toyota would have had to report to work and would not have been able to help their familities and their citizens in the region who were suffering,\\\" Toyota suppled food, water, gasoline, using its large trucks to the people of the region. \\\"Mr Toyota said 'save and support the people in the region',\\\" Doi said. \\\"We regret the inconvenience caused to our Caribbean and Latin American consumers. But afterwards, we increased the production so that we could respond to their situation in a speedy manner in order to deliver vehicles and spare parts to our customers,\\\" he said. Toyota remains the most popular car in Japan. Ria Taitt visited Japan from January 27 to February 7 at the invitation of the Japanese Government.

WOOING: A younger Sundar with Kayso. SOME 30-odd years ago, when the Solomon Hochoy Highway was completed and fully opened to traffic (initially, only one carriageway was built and used), accidents close to the Claxton Bay flyover were not uncommon. Many were fatal, and that at a time when there were fewer than one-third the vehicles we now have using the nation's roadways. Because accidents close to Claxton Bay happened more frequently than elsewhere, people tried to figure out why this was so. I should add that I have lived in Claxton Bay since 1973, so I know that section of the Hochoy Highway well. Superstitious people blamed the \\\"death strip\\\" on a nearby headless statue that sat on a hill overlooking the area. It occurred to me, a realist, that it was one of the few sections of the highway that did not run straight. If you think of it carefully, from the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway entering/exiting Port of Spain, the Uriah Butler and Hochoy highways run almost straight, without corners. The first corner is on the approach to the Freeport flyoverand there have been several horrible accidents there. On the South-bound section, several speeding vehicles \\\"straightened\\\" the corner by flying through the space between the two flyovers. They landed 20 or so feet below, on the Freeport Mission Road, many with fatal consequences. I recall one accident in which the vehicle that \\\"flew\\\" off the flyover landed on a taxi, killing one occupant. Several fatalities have occurred in that vicinity over the years. The second, more dangerous corner is on the approach to Claxton Bay. Motorists on the South-bound carriageway face not only a sharp corner, but a fairly steep, downhill gradient as well. One can imagine, therefore, what can happen when a motorist is speeding on that approach, and loses concentration for a split-second. He would fly across the median and should he miss the stout pillars that support the flyover, end up crossing the northbound carriageway. Travelling in the opposite direction there is also a gradient and corner, but the former is not that steep. What these features signal to any sober motorist is that you need to be extra-cautious on approaching the Claxton Bay flyover. One should moderate one's speed, grip the steering wheel with both hands, and be ready to apply brakes if that becomes necessary. Such precautions are even more of an imperative given the speed that modern vehicles constructed with flimsy alloys can attain. Add drunkenness or being sleepy to the equation, and what you have is a recipe for disaster. The Express editorial last Friday also correctly identified another dangerthe use of cellular phones while driving. In many ways the cellphone is more dangerous to humankind than a blessing. Many motorists, mainly the young and inexperienced, seem to be glued to these devices when they are driving. Some even send text messages while driving! Few have hands-free kits that at least mitigate the dangers of talking while driving. Experienced drivers know that once one wheel of these fast-but-flimsy vehicles loses traction, that's it. The vehicle spins out of control, and the rest is bloody history. Sensible drivers know other than lack of concentration, it's almost impossible to lose control of a vehiclebarring, say, a blown tyre or dropping into a huge pothole. Yet, whenever we hear of accidents that are claiming lives and maiming more people, there is always the report: the driver lost control of the vehicle. Bull, I say. Driving anywhere in Trinidad, from the most remote districts to those with heavy traffic, has become a hazardous venture. In my autumn years, I now have to keep peering into my rear-view mirrors, look ahead of me and try to pre-determine what some fool might do, check the shoulder for some jackass speeding on it. In fact, within recent times, I even look at traffic approaching in the opposite direction. Carnage on the nation's roads is cause for concern. Runaway vehicles are worse than runaway crime. In the latter, if the criminal is caught, at least he or she is brought to justice, maybe jailed. On the nation's roadways, criminals can kill innocent people and drive away without even stopping. I have long fulminated against the archaic traffic laws that offer incentives to reckless motorists rather than punish them. Imagine having to pay a fine of $200 for driving on the shoulder of the highway, or a similar amount for drag-racing. After last week's deadly accident at Claxton Bay, Roger Ganesh, Director of Highways, visited the area to see what can be done to curb the carnage. What he needs to tell Minister Colm Imbert is that implementation of the breathalyser legislation is more important than dreaming of a rapid rail system. Fines for dangerous driving should be punitive, not puny! CCTV cameras at these \\\"danger zones\\\" will help capture road-criminals. Seize their vehicles and impound them at police stations: they are sure to find them missing parts and accessories when they retrieve them! Implement a \\\"points\\\" system, a \\\"highways hotline\\\" so law-abiding motorists can report dangerous activities on the nation's roads. Too many innocent people are paying with their lives and limbs for the sins of lawless motorists.

In a media release on Wednesday, Paray said, \\u201cAs we approach the dry season, it is a disgrace as well as serious incompetence that for all of the Mayaro constituency, we have a fire tender that operates with a defective pump.\\u201d He said that fire tender is also expected to service areas in Rio Claro, Biche and Poole as the appliance at the Rio Claro Fire Station was also defective. Paray said, \\u201cThe defective pump which is currently in use is woefully inadequate if a severe fire breaks out either in someone\\u2019s home or business.\\u201d He said the fire tender which was assigned in May 2017 was involved in a vehicular accident and has been parked up at the station since September 2018. Paray said the situation can become disastrous if it is not resolved immediately. He said approximately 14,000 residents depend on the Mayaro Fire Station for relief. This situation, he said, can worsen as the constituency was also facing an unreliable water supply. The Mayaro Fire Station was commissioned in 2015 by then\\u2014prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar. However, it was not outfitted with a fire tender and the area continued to be serviced by the Rio Claro Fire Station, until 2017.

The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisherfolk and people in poor coastal communities. The Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this country's worst environmental disaster in history. This is the fourth in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, head, Express Investigative Desk. Petrotrin's continued failure to follow its own risk-assessment warnings after the disastrous events of last December 17 has led to several new oil and gas leaks for this year already, Express investigations have found. The oil giant's failure to follow the 2010 Hapuarachchi mechanical integrity blueprint for refinery safety and continued use of aged infrastructure with identified hazards saw new leaks opening up on a three-inch butane line (early January), No. 27 sea line (a vapour return line, also in January), a flange leak on No. 22 sea line (gas oil, also in January), leaking expansion joint on No. 25 sea line (gasoline, early February), corrosion holes on sea line No. 61 (fuel oil) on March 31 and corrosion hole on sea line No. 21 (motor gasoline) on April 2. Company-issued Inspection Advice Tickets (IATs) for some of the problematic pipelines show some of the same vulnerabilities identified in the 2010 Mechanical Integrity Report for the refinery's marine infrastructure and a December 27, 2013 IAT for the failed No. 10 sea line, specifically\\u2014failed maintenance, severe corrosion, delayed inspections and leaking expansion joints, flanges and valves, among other things. The leaks are said to be \\\"negligible\\\". As reported in Part I of this series, the State-owned oil and gas company overlooked multiple safety warnings, including a spate of negligible leaks on its pipelines and its own recommendations to replace severely corroded marine infrastructure, including its No. 10 sea line which failed dramatically on December 17. Documents obtained by this newspaper reveal that Petrotrin's maintenance scorecard has been less than exemplary. In the case of No. 27 sea line, identified as a medium-risk line by Gamini Hapuarachchi, Petrotrin's former Inspection Engineering head, the company neglected to do a crucial inspection in 2011. The IAT for No. 27 found an entire section of pipe resting on the ground without the requisite pipe support or protective safety wrapping. It noted that about \\\"150-inches of the line is severely corroded and covered with debris\\\" and a substantial number of flanges were \\\"severely corroded\\\" at the bottom. It found mechanical damage and sections that were so \\\"severely deteriorated\\\" it showed signs of \\\"crevice corrosive\\\". The company-issued IAT for No. 25 on February 7 revealed \\\"severe external corrosion under loose and deteriorated (safety) wrapping\\\" and several leaking expansion joints. And, as with No. 10 sea line, the primary degradation driver in all of the failed pipelines, including No. 15, No. 22, No. 25, No 27, and No. 61, was identified as \\\"external corrosion\\\". No. 15, another high-risk fuel oil line, failed on December 26. A section of the 12-inch diameter line collapsed into the sea after a support hanger gave way. That spill was contained in the Pointe-a-Pierre Harbour. In the case of No. 61, small line leaks developed into corrosion holes, according to persons with knowledge of the situation. This leak was also reported to have been contained in the harbour area. A corrosion hole was also identified as the problem with the April 2 leak on sea line No. 21. Pipe stress analysis and other integrity pipeline tests conducted by Hapuarachchi on failed sections of sea lines at the Petrotrin refinery found that: \\\"if a failure should occur, it is assumed that the mode of failure of these lines being that of a corrosion hole.\\\" More pipeline integrity issues also forced the February 11 closure of the company's Lube Oil Jetty, sources have disclosed. Critical lines which move hazardous hydrocarbon product were scheduled for urgent maintenance work after safety hazards were flagged. The company's own investigative report into the events leading to the No.10 failure found that the accident happened because of Petrotrin's own careless actions. Process Engineer Mervyn Cummings, the company man appointed as lead investigator, found that the state oil and gas company has been operating for years without critical spare parts like expansion joints or any staff in its Defect Elimination Section of the Reliability Engineering Department. He noted with concern the Petrotrin practice of allowing temporary fixes to become permanent fixtures. In a business culture where safety plays second fiddle to bottom line, Cummings found an absence of documented work plans or Management of Change (MOC) documents for change-outs of expansion joints and other repairs in violation of industry standards. He found what was supposed to be a temporary fix in 2002 on a sea line still in place 13 years later. His review of MOC documents for port operations from 2008 to January this year turned up a pipe spool (temporary replacement for failed expansion joint) doing hard overtime on the job. He said Petrotrin's Port Maintenance Superintendent, in office since May 2012, had previously requested the replacement of all the expansion joints because of the high incidence of leaks that \\\"are increasingly difficult to stop.\\\" He found instances where glands were tightened so much that the underside of the joints became deformed. Cummings pointed to the safety hazards related to extended use of pipe spools which do not possess any thermal expansion capability. He said this can cause the pipeline to move and create strain on the stationary section. In effect, exceed the design capabilities of the line, he said. As reported previously, the IAT on No. 10 listed several leaking expansion joints, valves and flanges. The ticket issued on No.15 also found leaking flanges and mechanical damage to the line. \\\"Pile Bent 30: the back to back support was severely deformed and knife-edge thin,\\\" according to the company-issued IAT. He found that the Hapuarachchi integrity management plan was not working as the safety blueprint intended. \\\"The failure of No.10 sea line could have been averted if the condition of these lines and the piping supports had been assessed/evaluated by the competent personnel basis the schedule proposed in the inspection report on the mechanical integrity of the sea lines produced by the Inspection Department in 2010 (016-2010) and corrective action taken as a result,\\\" Admitting to technical expertise \\\"limitations\\\" of the four-member team and the short time frame set for the report, Cummings urged Petrotrin to conduct further expert study on the matter and to review its design and maintenance practices. He also urged that equipment identified as medium or high-risk should be taken out of service until it is declared safe and fit for service by the competent experts. The Hapuarachchi report identified six high risk lines and more than ten medium risk sea lines at the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery. \\u2014To be continued on Sunday TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Among the disturbing disclosuresthe absence of a full-time pathologist, microbiologist haematologist and no neurosurgeon at the nation's largest public health institution, a situation that has led to people with brain injuries being rushed to the Port of Spain General Hospital, only to be returned by ambulance, and dying on the way back. The letter was penned by Dr Steve Budhooram, the hospital's head of department, General Surgery, who wrote \\\"the public needs to know not to sustain a head injury in South Trinidad\\\". His appeal comes in the wake of the death after a Ceasarean section of Chrystal Boodoo-Ramsoomair and the decision by the board of the South-West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) to suspend five doctors and five nurses involved in her care. The letter, which at times took on a tone of desperation and despair, was addressed to the hospital's acting medical director, Dr Anand Chatoorgoon; board chairman, Dr Lackram Bodoe; board executive medical director, Dr Akenath Misir; nursing manager, Betty Ann Pilgrim; acting general manager of nursing, Geraldine Lewis; the heads of hospital departments and consultants attached to the department of surgery. The letter was sent last Tuesday in the midst of another crisis at the hospital, with elective surgeries cancelled and patients crowding the medical wards because doctors, concerned they were in breach of Health Ministry policy, were spending more time assessing and treating patients at the Accident and Emergency department and on the wards and delaying the release of improving patients, in an effort to ensure they were not accused of medical negligence. Doctors said they were fearful they, too, would be disciplined or suspended. The issue was said to be \\\"resolved\\\" on Thursday with the intervention of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, with the Medical Professionals Association of Trinidad and Tobago (MPATT) agreeing to a review of the systems at the San Fernando General Hospital. But Dr Budhooram's letter outlines deep and complex problems. He noted in the letter that during a recent meeting, his department took the unanimous decision \\\"to adhere to strict, current, accepted guidelines in the management of surgical patients. No more will we be coerced with taking shortcuts and make do with what is available at the San Fernando General Hospital, thereby setting up the personnel in the department for lawsuits, suspensions and even criminal action taken against them. For too long, the (SWRHA) and even the Ministry of Health have blatantly disregarded our call for better facilities and conditions to optimally treat surgical patients\\\". Dr Budhooram said the shortage of staff is chronic, with his department operating with five firms (medical teams) but only three registrarsdoctors with advanced training in a specialist field. He wrote, \\\"We are now told that the two acting registrars have to revert to senior house officer (doctors training in specialist field) as they have no postgraduate degree. It would, indeed, be a ridiculous situation if a specialist medical officer has to supervise the senior house officer in the middle of the night to drain an abscess, as the Ministry of Health dictates.\\\" He said there was a nursing shortage in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) department \\\"We are also on the brink of a disaster waiting to happen. International standards dictate that on a surgical ward, there should be one nurse to five patients. In the department, this does not happen on the afternoon and night shifts. There might be approximately three nurses to 30 patients, with the ratio being even greater on weekends and public holidays. We will no longer tolerate this. We have decided to tailor to elective list to meet the nursing demands of the evening and night shifts.\\\" Budhooram said on the surgical wards, there was a shortage of basic supplies over the past year. \\\"Erratic supply of syringes, blood bottles, needles, gloves, incontinent pads is the order of the day. We are expected to work with this. We will not continue this way,\\\" he wrote. On the shortage of monitoring devices, Budhooram wrote, \\\"The wish lists...were promptly denied citing financial problems. This is unacceptable and only serves to frustrate the department\\\". With no neurosurgeon assigned to the hospital, Budhooram said patients have died for lack of neurosurgical care. \\\"Even more scandalous is that emergent patients (those with life-threatening injuries) are transported to POSGH [Port of Spain General Hospital] for neurosurgical operations and promptly placed in the ambulance for transport back to SFGH, only to die on the way or on arrival at hospital. I told the ex-CEO, Paula Chester-Cumberbatch, in a meeting that this is not bad medicine, but barbaric medicine. Nothing was done.\\\" Budhooram wrote that at a recent meeting of the heads of department with Bodoe and Misir, the assurance was given that the chief medical officer, Dr Anton Cumberbatch, was dealing with this problem. \\\"I see no end in sight, but the public needs to know not to sustain a head injury in South Trinidad\\\". Budhooram stated with no gastroenterologist for four years, surgeons were unable to do endoscopies (internal non-surgical procedures) for patients with (gastrointestinal) bleeds as vouchers have not been given out for these endoscopic examinations to be done privately. \\\"We have reverted to the old days to do surgery for all (gastrointestinal) bleeds when the majority can be done endoscopically, with no surgery. We have also had to go back twenty-five years to explore common bile ducts as ERCP (a technique that enables the doctor to diagnose problems with the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas) is not available here. \\\"What is even more distressing is when (Bodoe) informs us that a gastroenterologist who is a T&T national has applied for the post a few months ago, however, our Human Resources department, with their usual tardiness, knowing the urgent need for this doctor, continues to drag their feet.\\\" Budhooram wrote that there was even a shortage of qualified radiologists. \\\"Imagine waiting six weeks for a CT (computer-assisted tomography scan), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) report long after the patient has been operated on. What a financial waste.\\\" Budhooram wrote that he has worked at the hospital for 34 years, and the problems have been festering for too long. \\\"It has finally erupted in the faces of these non-performers with disastrous consequences.\\\" He wrote, \\\"We are at our lowest ebb. Patient care is being dictated by the total inefficiencies of the authorities at the SWRHA and Ministry of Health. We have towed the line, \\\"cut corners and stretched the limited and archaic services to the limit. Given the consequences and the debacle which took place in the O&G department, we are not prepared to go that way. I am, therefore, informing you that we will demand from the authorities the necessary services to give safe and optimal care to the patient.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

On a fateful December day when Christmas shopping occupied the minds of most people, a 16-inch diameter sea line broke at the State-owned refinery, sending a rush of black fuel oil into the Gulf of Paria and along the south-western coastline. The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisherfolk and people in poor coastal communities. The Sunday Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this country's worst environmental disaster. This is the tenth in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, head, Express Investigative Desk A revolving cast of oil executives at the State-owned energy giant Petrotrin each played a part in the persistent failure to comply with mandatory safety codes and their own risk assessment process, including a package of Shell-bought Risk Based Inspection (RBI) systems. Continuing Sunday Express investigations found that the State's oil executives used selective risk assessment results and temporary fixes to hide the gravity and scale of aging facilities that\\u2014in large part\\u2014are as old as the refinery's operations. As reported in last Sunday's paper, weak regulation by the State oversight agencies and government complicity allowed Petrotrin to exploit the weaknesses in the system, hide the truth about its pipeline integrity management problems and ignore repeated safety warnings of its own technical experts to the detriment of life and the environment. Inspection reports, board minutes, internal investigations into accidental deaths, blow-outs, bad welds, leaks and spills, and other company documents obtained by the Sunday Express detailed a culture of shortcuts and complacency where loyalty and friendship counts far more than competence, adherence to the rules and accountability. A review of company data and interviews with current and former Petrotrin officials reveal that despite a plethora of cutting-edge systems, blueprints and pipeline diagnostics to improve its risk management and spill-trajectory modelling, the oil giant failed to meet its own standards and the requirements of the law. One element running through the Petrotrin narrative is the management failure to follow the specific safety recommendations of its own experts. Persons familiar with the situation say this is why the No 10 accident and subsequent oil and gas spills were inevitable. \\\"It was only a matter of time,\\\" said one insider, noting that the accidents will continue to pile up until and unless Petrotrin takes care of all of its identified and outstanding high-risk mechanical integrity problems. As reported in Monday's Express, Petrotrin's push for higher profit margins continues to put workers' safety at risk. If December 17 was a wake-up call for the slumbering oil giant, it is not evident by how it conducts its business which continues to put profits before safety. Petrotrin's own data suggests that the company made a lot of avoidable mistakes on the way to the December 17 bunker fuel spill and even then failed to manage it properly. Petrotrin insiders are still scratching their heads over how the company failed to follow its own historical data on marine spill-trajectory modelling which show a predicted pathway from Pointe-a-Pierre to the south-western peninsula and its apparent inability \\u2014after a near 100 years in the oil business\\u2014to differentiate crude oil from bunker fuel oil. The State company which failed to ask for help, rebuffed the help that was offered by bpTT and then lied about almost everything else, including the size of the spill, ignored all of the evidence that the oil was headed to the south-western coastline and made no effort to protect the shoreline of La Brea. The company stayed on script that identified spills at Pointe-a-Pierre, Riser Platform 5 and Platform 17 were all \\\"successfully contained\\\" and that the black oil washing up on tar slicked beaches along the coastline belonged to somebody else. It was all a mystery, according to Petrotrin, which had full knowledge before 6 o'clock on the morning of December 17 that it had over 7,000 barrels of unaccounted-for oil somewhere out in the Gulf of Paria. Moreover, it claimed its own laboratory analysis identified the weathered samples taken from La Brea and other beaches along the south-western coastline as crude. The Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) tests called it in as a match for the missing 7,554 barrels of Petrotrin bunker fuel oil days later. Petrotrin's deceit is perhaps best summed up in this response from manager, Health Safety and the Environment (HSE), Shyam Dyal, who up until a year ago was deputy chairman of the Environmental Management Authority (EMA). In a December comment about the source of the La Brea oil, the HSE boss said: \\\"It is a question that is currently being asked\\u2014how did the oil get on the La Brea beach We cannot see a direct link to the Trinmar incidents and the Pointe-a-Pierre incident at this point in time. We are still continuing investigations.\\\" Perhaps the company didn't look hard enough at its own marine spill trajectory data. Had the HSE manager and Petrotrin top brass looked at its own data, including pictures taken during aerial fly-bys over the affected areas at 11.30 a.m. on December 18, it would have noticed the vast column of oil, about 1,000 feet long and 100 feet wide, about three to four miles west of the refinery Berth No.1 and the oily sheen sighted around the Oropouche Bank north of La Brea. The company which sprayed about 1,705 gallons of the chemical dispersant, Coreexit, as part of its containment effort over the polluted Gulf of Paria area, contended that its aerial and marine surveillance failed to detect oil on the surface. Industry analysts question why Petrotrin expected to find oil on the surface when its chosen chemical, Corexit, was known to sink oil below the surface. Further, company logs related to the 2 a.m. fuel bunker loading operation that went disastrously wrong show that at 8.30 a.m. on December 17, the oil spill was moving in a south-westerly direction. Asked to explain the company's failure to shore off protected coastline given all of the available data known to company officials, Petrotrin's president, Khalid Hassanali, in an e-mail response to the Sunday Express, said: \\\"Commencing on December 17, 2013 and continuing over the days following, our operations were impacted by several incidents. \\\"In addition to having to treat with the spill at Pointe-a-Pierre, we were treating with what was then considered to be a different spill at La Brea (no nexus was yet established between the Pointe-a-Pierre and La Brea incidents) as well as other incidents in our Trinmar fields. \\\"Our response to the specific incidents, placement of booms etc were guided by the results of our oil spill-trajectory models and the situations as they developed on the ground.\\\" But historical data on environmental parameters such as water temperature, wind speed, wave heights and oceanic conditions specific to the Gulf of Paria suggests a spill trajectory from Pointe-a-Pierre would more than likely travel in a south-westerly direction. Hassanali said Petrotrin relied on its oil spill-trajectory modelling to come up with its own analysis of how to respond to the spill. \\\"Our oil spill-trajectory model indicated that, given the circumstances, there was a 95 per cent probability that any fuel that escaped would have been on the surface and both the aerial and marine surveys conducted did not reveal any oil slicks leaving Pointe-a-Pierre. This is why no nexus was initially established between the incident at Pointe-a-Pierre and the spill at La Brea.\\\" What has emerged so far suggests that Petrotrin has been less than candid with the national community, was slow to respond to the spill and then tried to lie its way out of the impending catastrophe. As reportedly previously in this series, a lot of the decisions made have been driven by the need to minimise the company's liability. Question is, who is going to hold Petrotrin to account given the State's complicity in this affair The Decision Makers responsible for maintaining mechanical integrity of plant and equipment: The board of directors, led by former energy minister in the Panday administration, Lindsay Gillette, President \\u2013 Khalid Hassanali Vice-President, Refinery and Marketing \\u2013 Mado Bachan Senior Manager, Refinery \\u2013 Luke McSween HSE Manager \\u2013 Shyam Dyal Manager, Inspection Services \\u2013 Edwin Caines Senior Superintendent, Marine Services \\u2013 Collin Piper Superintendent of Inspection Services \\u2013 Savitry Rajpaul Maintenance Manager \\u2013 Kishore Jhagroo Manager Engineering Services \\u2013 Roopchan Balkaran Continues on Sunday TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

However, a media release signed by the ODPM's chief executive officer Dr Stephen Ramroop yesterday stated that the National Extreme Incident Response Team(NEIRT) \\\" will adequately address all gaps in the incident command system and information flow.\\\" A meeting was held yesterday at the ODPM's office in Tacarigua with all first responder agencies. Ramroop said the policy for NEIRT was already drafted and will be sent to Cabinet for approval. On June 14, the midday crash caused a five-hour long traffic pile-up affecting tens of thousands of people, causing multiple minor accidentson secondary roads choked with vehicles and chaos outside many schools. The problem was only resolved after nightfall. Noel had said the ODPM was not expected to get involved in the emergency response.

Jim Brokaw founded the Families of EgyptAir 990 as a support group after losing his father and stepmother in the 1999 crash, caused by a co-pilot who is believed to have intentionally flown the jet into the ocean. The Brunswick, Maine, resident said he has reached out to Germanwings families over Facebook, offering to provide them any help he can based upon his experience dealing with such a tragedy. Investigators believe Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz intentionally flew a passenger plane into a mountain in France on Tuesday, killing all 150 people onboard. Brokaw says I want people to know theyre not alone. He says that after such a crash, families can be deluged with information and questions, and it helps to have a point of contact who can help them sort through it all at a time theyre still grieving. I ADDED THIS. He added: Its disorienting, its literally unspeakable there are no words for expressing the total loss. ? 1:40 p.m. (1240 GMT, 8:40 a.m. EDT) The parents of 37-year-old Robert Oliver, one of the three American citizens killed in the Germanwings crash, say they are finding solace in memories of their son. ?Instead of focusing our minds and hearts on those last nine or 10 minutes (of the flight), we prefer to think about those 37 years that weve been together, father Robert Oliver Calvo said. He told reporters in Barcelona that he feels no anger toward co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, accused of crashing the Airbus A320 into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. ?Im really sad for those parents of that young pilot. I cant imagine what theyre going through right now, he said. Robert Oliver worked for a clothing company in Barcelona, where his parents also live. ? 12:45 p.m. (1145 GMT, 7:45 a.m. EDT) German prosecutors say they have found evidence that the co-pilot of the Germanwings plan which crashed in the French Alps appears to have hidden evidence of an illness from his employers. Prosecutors in the western city of Duesseldorf say they seized medical documents from the home of Andreas Lubitz that indicate an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment. Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in a statement Friday that torn-up sick notes for the day of the crash support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues. He said the search of Lubitzs home revealed no suicide note or evidence of any political or religious motivation for his actions. ? 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT, 7:30 a.m. EDT) Three Kazakhs who perished in the Germanwings flight were on a European vacation when they made a spur-of-the-moment decision to go to Spain to watch one of soccers most popular matches. The vacation to Europe was precious time together for Kazakh couple Erbol Imankulov and his wife Aizhan Isengaliyeva, after he recently moved 700 kilometers (400 miles) from his home city of Ust-Kamenogorsk to take up a job in the coal city of Karaganda. The diversion to go watch El Clasico on Sunday between Barcelona and Real Madrid was a special treat for their 26-year old son, Adil, who was travelling with them. All three Kazakhs perished in the Germanwings crash from Barcelona to Duesseldorf that killed 150 people on Tuesday. Adils sister, 14-year-old Diana, missed out on the trip. She was unable to get a visa. The co-pilot is suspected of intentionally crashing the plane into a mountain in the French Alps during the Barcelona to Duesseldorf flight. ? 11:50 a.m. (1050 GMT, 6:50 a.m. EDT) Frances leading pilots union is filing a lawsuit over leaks about the investigation into the Germanwings crash. Guillaume Schmid, a representative of the SNPL union, said Friday that pilots are angry that information about the dramatic final moments of the flight were reported in the media before prosecutors and others were informed. After the media reports, a prosecutor announced that cockpit recordings indicate the co-pilot of the Germanwings A320 jet intentionally flew the plane into a mountain on Tuesday. All 150 aboard were killed. The lawsuit is over violating a French law on keeping information about investigations secret while they are ongoing. The lawsuit doesnt name an alleged perpetrator, a common method in French law that leaves it to investigators to determine who is at fault. Schmid said that pilots are saddened by the accident and understand the publics wish for immediate information, but decried pressure on investigators and said that can lead to misleading the public instead. ? 11:30 a.m. (1030 GMT, 6:30 a.m. EDT) Germanys president has attended a memorial service in the western town of Haltern for 16 students and two teachers from the local high school who were killed in the Germanwings plane crash. President Joachim Gauck and North Rhine-Westphalias state governor, Hannelore Kraft, attended the service along with students at the towns St. Sixtus church. Investigators believe Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked himself alone in the cockpit during Tuesdays flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, and then intentionally crashed the plane into a mountainside in the southern French Alps. All 150 people aboard the plane were killed. ? 10:25 a.m. (0925 GMT, 5:25 a.m. EDT) Germanwings says it is setting up a family assistance center in Marseille for relatives of the 150 people killed when one of its planes crashed in the French Alps. Investigators believe Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz intentionally crashed the plane into a mountainside during Tuesdays flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said in a statement that in these dark hours our full attention belongs to the emotional support of the relatives and friends of the victims of Flight 9525. The airline, a subsidiary of German carrier Lufthansa, says some grieving relatives took part in a religious service Thursday afternoon near the crash site. ? 9:50 a.m. (0850 GMT, 4:50 a.m. EDT) Frances prime minister has called on German airline Lufthansa to provide all information about Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who investigators believe intentionally slammed a plane into a French mountainside, killing all 150 people aboard. Prime Minister Manuel Valls called on Lufthansa to give the maximum of information so that we can understand why this pilot got to the point of this horrific action. In an interview with French network iTele, Valls said Friday that nothing would be ruled out until the end of a full investigation. The Germanwings flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf crashed Tuesday in the southern French Alps. Germanwings is a division of Lufthansa. ? 9:15 a.m. (0815 GMT, 4:15 a.m. EDT) German police have searched the home of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz in Duesseldorf and seized material that will now be examined as part of the investigation into the crash that killed 150 people in the French Alps. French investigators believe Lubitz locked himself inside the cockpit and then intentionally smashed the Germanwings plane into a mountainside. A spokeswoman for Duesseldorf police denied reports Friday that the officers had made any significant discovery yet. ?No crucial piece of evidence has been found yet, Susanna Heusgen told The Associated Press. Duesseldorf prosecutors say they plan to release an update on their investigation around noon (1100 GMT, 7 a.m. EDT). ? 7 a.m. (0600 GMT, 2 a.m. EDT) The co-pilot who authorities believe intentionally crashed an airplane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, likely first honed his flying skills for months in Arizona. Lufthansa Group, which owns Germanwings airline, said Thursday that 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz trained in Bremen, Germany, and Phoenix starting in 2008. A Facebook page bearing his name lists Phoenix Goodyear Airport among his interests. The airport houses Airline Training Center Arizona, a Lufthansa-owned training facility. Aviation experts say students there log flight hours and attend classes on navigation in an 18-month period. On Thursday, German and Lufthansa flags outside the facility were flying at half-staff. Sunshine and vast air space have historically made Arizona a popular location for pilot training. French prosecutors say Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit of Germanwings Flight 9525 on Tuesday before the jet slammed into the mountainside.

On Friday, more than three years after Mr Sonnylal was killed in a vehicular accident, the case against the defendant, Timothy De Leon, was dismissed after the police officer who had laid the charge failed to turn up in court. In dismissing the matter at the Princes Town Magistrates Court, Magistrate Deborah Quintyne noted that January 10 had been listed as the final date on which the matter would be heard. In the circumstances, she felt obliged to dismiss the case against Mr De Leon who had been charged with dangerous driving leading to Mr Sonnylals death in 2011. When asked, officers gave conflicting information regarding the whereabouts of the officer who had laid the charge. Such police disaster is magnified to mass proportions at the nearby Princes Town Police Station whose notoriety was outlined in yesterdays Sunday Express. This stations sins range from the infamous case of the rats who ate the cocaine evidence to a series of prisoner escapes, several of whom later claimed that they bribed officers to facilitate their getaway. The most recent charge against the station comes from 18-year-old Jamerson John who claims officers stripped him to his underwear and set fire to his genitals after he refused to admit to a robbery. If there is a place crying out for a thorough investigation it is the Princes Town Police Station. All the signs indicate a rotten state of affairs there. Without prejudicing the legal matters involving the teenager, it would be fair to say that the multiple incidents warrant a sharp focus on the management and officers at Princes Town station going back several years. We shudder to think about the impact of all this on public confidence in the officers of this station. The responsibility for the integrity of police operations throughout the country falls squarely on the shoulders of acting Commissioner of Police Stephen Williams. After apologising to the Sonnylal family, he must explain why the system failed to ensure the prosecuting officers presence in court on Friday. While this is far from being an isolated incident, it will provide the public with some insight into the institutional weaknesses that allow the continuing perversion of justice by absent officers. The people of Trinidad and Tobago cannot continue to be robbed of justice by police failures which could originate from any number of sources including mismanagement, poor communication systems or outright corruption. To be fair to the acting CoP, he inherited a poisoned chalice. These are long-standing problems that have defied one Commissioner after another. But he is in the job now and there is no denying that in applying for it, he would have felt himself adequately equipped.

Just be grateful for what was, and hope that lessons are learnt from the tragic death of Jizelle Salandy. In a country that obsesses over rewards, financial or otherwise, for our prominent achievers in all walks of life, the greatest, most enduring tribute to the multi-titled world champion female boxer would be for all who treat the roadways as a drag racing strip or their vehicles as a means to vent their frustrations to do one simple thing: slow down. But that's not going to happen, is it It's much easier to put up a plaque, dedicate some facility or other or create an award here or there in the fallen heroine's name rather than undertake a concerted, comprehensive campaign that could have much more beneficial long-term consequences for the nation, and especially a younger generation, which, like all younger generations since the dawn of mankind, is defined by a belief that they are almost immortal and immune to tragedy. That is until something like this happens, and we all wonder why. So it has been, so it is, so it always will be. Call it destiny. Call it hardenness. But it would be nice to think that people would be more concerned with acting responsibly and urging others under their sphere of influence to do the same instead of putting flowers and heartfelt notes next to a so-called \\\"killer\\\" pillar that, as best as I can recall, has never moved from its position under the NP flyover in more than 25 years. Every once in a while a society goes through something like this when a prominent personality is shown to be flesh and blood and very, very fragile, just like the rest of us. Rather than being preoccupied with building shrines and bestowing sainthood on people like Diana Spencer, for example, wouldn't it be more productive to use the positive aspects of such deceased celebrities to make us recognise that every one of us, if given the opportunity, can be heroes in our own right, even if it doesn't bring with it fame, glory and unbelievable riches English society, not just English football, was rocked by the death of eight members of the celebrated \\\"Busby Babes\\\" of Manchester United when the team's plane crashed on take-off following a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany, on February 6, 1958. This team of brilliant young players, under the management of Sir Matt Busby, were league champions two years in a row and had qualified for the semi-finals of the European cup when tragedy struck. Among the victims was Duncan Edwards, who died 15 days after the crash at the age of 21. Almost 51 years after the disaster, those who saw the centre-half in action maintain that Edwards, who made his senior England international debut at 18, would have been one of his country's greatest players had he lived. Pretty much the same was said of cricketer Collie Smith, the outstanding Jamaica and West Indies all-rounder who died in a vehicular accident on September 9, 1959 in England at the age of 26. Smith had marked his Test debut with innings of 44 and 104 against the might of Australia's Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller at Sabina Park in 1955, and combined with his useful off-spin and infectious enthusiasm for the game, was being compared with the rising all-round star of the time, Garfield Sobers. Smith and Sobers had actually become great friends in their brief time together in the West Indies squad and the loss was made all the more painful for Sobers as he was in the car driven by another West Indian player, the Barbadian fast bowler Tom Dewdney, when the crash claimed the life of the ebullient Jamaican. Ayrton Senna had scaled the heights of Formula One motor racing as champion driver three times already when he met his end on May 1 during the third race of the 1994 season at the Imola racetrack in San Marino. Yet it was because of the Brazilian's fiery brilliance and tempestuous duels with Frenchman Alain Prost on the track, and captivating personality off it, that his homeland mourned his passing at 34 as a national tragedy. His demise left the world of motorsport speculating as to whether Germany's Michael Schumacher, who won his first Formula One title that year, would have been able to dominate the sport so completely for the next decade had Senna still been on the starting grid. At least they all tasted success in varying degrees on the international stage: Edwards, Smith, Senna and Salandy. But what of someone who seemed destined to achieve so much until we realised that his fate was written differently from what most expected Every year in the cricket season, QRC old boys get together for the annual Shirvan Pragg Memorial Match, paying tribute to the 19-year-old left-handed wrist-spinner and batsman who was the backseat victim of a vehicular accident in 1982, mere weeks after he had returned home from a successful tour of England as vice-captain of a powerful West Indies under-19 squad led by Roger Harper. Despite his tremendous success at youth level, it is debatable whether Pragg would have ever had the chance to establish himself at the highest level for the West Indies, given that this was at the every height of Caribbean dominance by speed.

There are said to be at least 12 more FLNG units that have been approved for use by other IOC's, and probably for NOC's (national oil companies) too and are awaiting final investment go-ahead before the shipyards get their confirmed orders. Why is this development important For the very good reason that it will make gas discoveries that are normally considered \\\"stranded\\\" difficult to commercialise for reasons of remoteness and thus inaccessible by pipelines now monetiseable. Companies that have had the misfortune, as they saw it, to find such gas will now be able, thanks to FLNG, to exploit it and to participate in IEA's predicted \\\"golden age\\\". Mind you, FLNG will not be coming cheap. Though Shell has not specified the cost of its historic project, industry sources have suggested it could be between US$5-US$10 billion. But this will undoubtedly be reduced as shipyards receive more orders for FLNG vessels and if traded gas is going to be as much in demand between now and 2035 as the IEA says rising to 5.1 trillion cubic metres, 1.8 trillion cm more than today, providing 25 per cent of the world's energy mix then it should not be difficult to achieve payback on such an investment. The \\\"new golden age of gas\\\" theory is well supported by a number of current developments, which will encourage the usage, and trading, of the commodity. These include: 1. The fact that the construction of LNG import terminals continues at a steady pace (with the probable exception of the United States, which, as I have written constantly here in recent weeks, now sets itself more as a gas exporter, certainly of LNG, than a gas importer, because of the increase in domestic gas production). Twenty-one LNG import facilities are currently being built, to join the 94 already in existence in 23 countries. The operators of those terminals clearly don't expect to be receiving coal or crude oil! 2. Because of the dangers of a radiation leak should an accident befall any nuclear power station, as recently occurred at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami, the world is rapidly falling out of love with nuclear. Germany has taken the decision to close all its 17 nuclear plants by 2022, which currently provides it with 23 per cent of its electric power. Other countries have chosen not to go ahead with nuclear energy at all, such as nearby Venezuela. Japan itself, which obtains over 30 per cent of its energy from nuclear power, has shut other plants since the disaster and guess what alternative it has turned to Why, LNG, of course. In April, Japan imported more LNG than it has ever done before, bringing in seven million tonnes to make up for the shortfall in nuclear generated electricity. Japan's LNG imports are set to rise by 19 per cent this year, according to analysts. 3. Of all the energy alternatives to nuclear, gas is favoured on the basis of its climate change credentials alone. It does emit heat-trapping gases when burned but 100 per cent less than coal and significantly less than oil. Of course, renewable energy (RE) emits no harmful substances at all but RE is not expected to be a major source of energy in the world, even by 2035. Gas, by contrast, will rise to become 25 per cent of the global energy mix, thanks to its adoption in electricity generation by the likes of China, India, the Middle East and South America. 4. A potential area of growth in gas demand that has been largely overlooked so far is the use of LNG as a fuel in shipping. As one shipping expert recently pointed out: \\\"Natural gas has substantial environmental benefits over oil-based bunkers, in that it contains virtually no sulpher and produces less CO2.\\\" The Maritime Authority in Denmark recently commissioned a study on how an LNG refueling infrastructure could be established in Northern Europe to cater to the increasing number of ships expected to opt for this fuel. So let's put all this in the context of Trinidad and Tobago, shall we We are already a major international trader of LNG, in fact, the seventh biggest in the world after only 12 years in the business. We will continue to profitably access the US market, never mind the fall in the gas price there on the back of increased domestic production and will also be selling to many other countries. Derek Hudson, president of BG Trinidad and Tobago and a man who should certainly know about these matters, confidently states in the June issue of ENERGY Caribbean magazine that: \\\"BG, BP, RepsolYPF, NGC and the Trinidad and Tobago government, would not have made all those LNG investments in four trains just to see production suddenly stop in the next few years.\\\" Exactly. But far from \\\"stopping\\\", my thesis is that Trinidad and Tobago should be busily preparing itself for taking maximum advantage of the \\\"new golden age of gas\\\" and that requires us to remain in the fast lane of LNG exports (we may well be participating in pipeline gas too, but to a much more modest extent). The gas price challenge, particularly in the US, can be overcome with Atlantic's determination to be cost competitive, and there is no threat of a gas shortage because the exploration activity to be conducted in the North Coast blocks will and you can take that to the bank result in the discovery of additional reserves. The stumbling block, as I see it, is the reluctance so far of the Minister of Energy and Energy Affairs Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan to publicly commit herself to the continuation of the LNG trading business. But it is something she absolutely needs to do if the de-bottlenecking of the four Atlantic trains is to go ahead, if new initiatives like Centrica's are to receive the green light and if budding gas trading entrepreneurs like Aerogas Processors Ltd's George A B Naime are to have the confidence to find ways of going after the small gas trades market that, by hook or by crook, will eventually materialise in the wider Caribbean.

Moral hazard, very simplified, is that irritating guy who totalled his car somehow, insurance bought him an even nicer one, and there was still a bit left over for a trip to Tobago; of course, he was driving carelessly knowing that, in an accident, insurance would cover the costs. Essentially, moral hazard describes the risk created when some party can act without bearing the full weight of its actions in the event of a mishap. Knowing that 'Peter pays for Paul', Paul arguably takes risks where he should not, and acts irresponsibly, with few, if any, consequences to consider. To label some accident as moral hazard then, is to automatically cast aspersions on the supposed victim and to create speculation as to the cause of disaster. The concept of 'too big to fail' is one which the American government is working feverishly to disband. It characterises companies that are so integral to the financial system that any of their collapses would signify a mortal blow, if not a death sentence, to the global economy. With credit unions fearing collapse given their CLICO exposure this 'too big to fail' idea is of very real, very current importance to Trinidad and Tobago. When a financial institution reaches a certain critical mass and becomes the provider of investments to other significant financial institutions, it can create a situation where there is risk to the entire system. In local circumstances, extraneous details tend to intrude. T&T is a small village to USA's big city. The multi-billionaires on Wall Street who had millions slashed from their bonuses elicited little pity in the overall scheme of things. The pensioners who invested in CLICO are another story altogether. Public sympathy and a general cry of broken promises may or may not govern the actions that government takes. However, determining whether the fall of CL Financial and subsidiaries is a moral hazard or is simply a casualty in a global crisis is of more immediate importance at this time. The recent financial crisis in the developed world comprised two parts. Firstly, investor greed elicited levels of illiquidity that banks should have avoided. Secondly, underlying assets were fundamentally toxic with high levels of risk being repackaged more attractively. People with little or no incomes were given loans to buy houses. And investors were persuaded to invest in these loans as they were considered to be top quality assets; of course history has proven otherwise. In this regard, the United States differs drastically from T&T. A major cornerstone in the arguments proposed by the CL Financial (CLF) group is the solidity of most underlying assets and the intrinsic value of real estate in the long-term. While assets were definitely inflated pre-crisis, current methods of valuing them may be excessively cautious. Government's \\\"twenty-year certificates\\\" offer yields a present value between 58 and 65 cents to the dollar on average, a far cry from what investors expected (or still expect) to receive. What needs to be considered is that the bulk of assets on CLICO's balance sheet do not represent the same risks as the toxic securities that destroyed Bear, Lehman and Merrill, to name a few. There was a global demand for liquidity as creditors demanded their money back and our regional giant was caught in the crossfire. While we must expect CLF to take some responsibility for its high leverage and subsequent liquidity crisis, it was, to a large extent, a product of its environment. As with Long Term Capital Management (see Part 1), CL Financial was too sure and too extravagant, yet was also simply, unluckily caught in the cogs of the economic downswing. What emerged was a good, or not so good, old-fashioned run on the business. In a panic, investors demanded cash that was tied to long-term assets and the values of those assets plunged. Had certain events not conspired against it, the company might have kept its extreme leverage unnoticed and its assets might have appreciated above government's current bailout proposals. Yet, regardless of potential future asset value, at what point is it government's role to rescue a private company It has been suggested that systemic risk has passed and CL is no longer \\\"too big to fail\\\". One might pose questions about publicly traded companies that have theoretically lost more than 50 per cent market value in the last five years. Does government's role as lender of last resort include an obligation to the private investor In fact, will managers of investment funds and banks pursue outrageous profits because they know that taxpayers will insure their mistakes Thankfully, regulation and legislation has evolved to constrain and monitor any financial imprudence. Conclusively, the lesson that we should take from the downfall of regional and American great-has-beens, is one in risk. What seems too good to be true, most likely is. Both investors and financial regulators should pay marked attention to warning bells that have grown increasingly louder with the evolution of risk management. These \\\"once in a lifetime\\\" breakdowns of institutions that are \\\"too big to fail\\\" and their necessary bailouts have occurred with higher frequency and will continue to do so if flaws in risk management remain unaddressed.

Monday January 23 is the first day of the Chinese New Year which will end on February 9, 2013. This year, 2012, is the Year of the Dragon. The dates for the Chinese Horoscope coincide with the lunar calendar. As with the western zodiac, the Chinese have 12 signs that follow in the same order but the Chinese name the year after one of 12 animal signs rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. Similar to western astrology, every Chinese birth sign has a particular character and qualities. People born in a specific year are believed to take on the character and qualities of the animal after which the year is named. The Dragon is the fifth sign in the Chinese Horoscope and signifies luck. There are five elements in the Chinese astrology metal, water, wood, fire and earth. The last appearance of the dragon was in 2000 or the \\\"metal\\\" dragon. This year we have the \\\"water\\\" dragon and already, to herald its entry, the rain has been falling every day for the past week. The closest I ever came to a dragon, apart from the many fantasy books, games and movies that are becoming increasingly popular, was a pair of rubber slippers that I owned. Some people call them flip-flops because of the noise they make and others call them \\\"drag-ons\\\". I almost broke my neck with one of those. I didn't expect an accident or predict any, but in this year of the water dragon, psychics are predicting that the world is going to hell in a handbasket at breakneck speed. LaMont \\\"Monte'' Hamilton says he holds multiple degrees in business, psychology and education, and has worked in the paranormal field full time for over 25 years. He predicts an Iranian revolution this summer; China will lose its reputation as a world financial leader after clashes with protesters begin over economic reform and will have a military conflict with Japan; panic and protests in all the major countries with citizens demanding economic reforms; several explosions in Israeli military bases; and civil war in the Phillipines. Judy Hevenly, whose clients include royalty, former presidents, Hollywood movie stars, and heads of state, and who was called in to work at the OJ Simpson trial, says gold will reach US$2,000 an ounce and oil US$130 a barrel this year. For the world's poor, this won't be a barrel of fun. She says there will be power outages in Paris, Las Vegas, London, New York and Los Angeles, and that Barack Obama will get a second term. She also predicts that angels will actually be seen walking among us by some with \\\"Extraordinary Powers of Perception\\\" (EPP). How do you know if you have EPP Simple. If you see angels walking among us you have EPP. Nikki, the self-proclaimed \\\"Psychic to the Stars'' boasts that she predicted the Japan earthquake and tsunami, the Wall Street protests in New York City, the devastating Joplin, Missouri tornadoes, the deaths of Elizabeth Taylor and Amy Winehouse, and the trouble in Syria. Her predictions include a giant earthquake in California; animals and birds, wild and domestic, will attack people leading up to the end of 2012; weird weather conditions worldwide including snow in Hawaii, Las Vegas and in the Caribbean (get your winter clothes ready); major earthquakes in Washington, Oregon, British Columbia and Alaska; giant prehistoric sea monsters under the sea; major UFO sightings all over the world; a possible landing of a space ship; a Stock Market crash like 1929 worldwide; North Korea attacks South Korea and Japan; an attack on the Vatican and the Pope; earth will fall off its axis a little more; and the Holy Grail will be found. That should make Da Vinci code author, Dan Brown, happy. She adds that a plane will crash into the White House in Washington, DC., an event which won't make the Obamas happy. And for parents who have not yet bought Atlases for their kids for geography class, hold off a bit since Nikki says that the map of the world will change because of catastrophic events happening in the world. Then there is the biggie the mother of all disaster predictions or the end of days. According to this one the world will end before the dragon departs. It is the \\\"121212\\\" prediction, claimed to be Mayan in origin, that the world will end on December 12, 2012. One website claims, \\\"In 2012 our solar system will cross with the Galactic Equator which only happens every 26,000 yearsThe Mayan Long Count calendar says the current age of mankind began on a day of destructive Earth movement and it will end on a day of destructive Earth movement. This day of movement could mean horrible earthquakes. It could also be translated to the missing planet Nibiru slamming into our planet.\\\" The planet Nibiru (an ancient name for Jupiter) supposedly comes through the solar system every 3,600 years and causes major destruction. Writer, Jean Claude Koven, says, \\\"Whether or not December 12, 2012 marks an immutable cosmological event or not becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy is moot. There is no question that it looms as a very significant moment. What concerns us most is wanting to know what will happen. At one end of the bell-curve of probabilities is total physical annihilation. At the opposite end is the arrival of the Golden Age we all dream about. Every other conceivable possibility lies between themThe Hogwarts Express is bound for the next dimension the Golden Age of our dreams. The problem is that until you become a wizard, you have no way of finding the right platform. The world, as you know it will definitely end on December 12, 2012, if that's what you choose. You will definitely be there when it happens, boarding one of the infinite number of trains leaving the station. Every one of us will be required to be on board.\\\" Whether Hogwarts or plain, unadulterated hogwash is up to you. As for me, I plan on an early Christmas.

BUILT ON SITE: The Roman Catholic Church in Vistabella which was built on the site of the mining disaster of 1904. ONE hundred and six years later, the story of 17 souls lost in a collapsed mine off Manjack Street, Vistabella, in December 1904, is being told again. The story has resurfaced, however, not because of the recent Chilean mining incident that seemed certain to end in disaster. That episode ended up this year's miracle story, with all 33 miners making it out alive after 69 days trapped underground because of the heroism of countless others. The tale is being told again, curiously, because of the collapse, two months ago, of the Pointe-a-Pierre Road in Vistabella, and the abandoning of three homes condemned by city officials. San Fernando Mayor Marlene Coudray said recently, \\\"At least three people hold the view that the mine could be responsible for the massive land slippage taking place near the Vistabella River.\\\" Vistabella lies on the northern extremities of San Fernando. In earlier times, it was home to East Indian immigrants assigned as labourers to work on Vistabella Sugar Estate, one of the largest in the San Fernando area. It had several names. East Indians called it Vista Beya (beautiful bay), the French called it Petit Bourgh (Little Town), San Fernandians called it Border Town, and it was the Spaniards who gave it the name Vista bella (a beautiful view). Apart from the Manjack Mine disaster, there was another event of historical importance to stamp collectors. The immigrants had only arrived in Trinidad a few years before some of them working on Vistabella Sugar Estate recovered a large brass bell from the Lady McLeod steamer in 1854, after it sank off the coast in Vistabella. On seeing the vessel sinking in the Gulf of Paria, they realised nothing could be done, but there were items of value on the steamer that could be saved. The bell was removed from the deck and carried ashore to the estate manager, George Lambie. Later they learned that the bell they recovered was from the steamer, a likeness of which was used on Trinidad's first postage stamp. The Lady McLeod stamp was designed and introduced in 1847 by the steamer's captain, David Bryce. Initially it was used as a receipt for transporting goods along the coastal towns. The stamp depicted a white ship on a blue background with the initials \\\"LMcL\\\" printed underneath. The Lady McLeod stamp has world recognition. The original was last seen in New York and its value was estimated at over US$2,000. The bell is kept in the foyer of the San Fernando City Council. Vistabella has a rich mineral resource called manjack, a type of pitchthe name possibly derived from the town of Manjack in the island of Madagascar, according to the historians. The manjack was first found in 1877 at Williamsville, but the biggest mine was found in 1898 in Vistabella. Following the discovery, extensive underground work started at the Vistabella mine, and continued until disaster struck. On December 17, 1904, while mining at a depth of 200 feet there was an explosion and 17 workers were killed and several injured. Entrance and exit was gained by using a ladder, and light was provided by gas lamp. The historians record that an explosion was heard between the fourth and fifh tunnels, which were some 200 feet from the surface. One man was thrown down as he shouted \\\"fire!\\\" Those at the main shaft experienced a rush of wind with the smell of gas coming up through the shaft. The workers panicked. As they struggled to reach the ladder they were affected either by fire or overcome by the gas. Altogether 17 workers perishedten Barbadians, five East Indians, one Grenadian and one Trinidadian. The manager of the mine made arrangements to bury the dead by supplying graves and coffins, and giving $12 to the representatives of each of the deceased. The government immediately ordered an enquiry, which took place on February 20, 1905. At the end of the sitting, the owners were charged with manslaughter and the matter heard before High Court judge Swan on April 17,1905. At the end of the trial, the owners of the mine were acquitted. Most of the workers and their families who were working on the mine belonged to a Baptist cult at Fabien Street, headed by High Priest Mellon. He told them it was no accident that 17 people were killed on December 17, and that they should leave the area, the story goes. They took his advice and moved to New Grant, near Princes Town. Years later, the site of the mining disaster was acquired by the Roman Catholic church. A church was built on the site and named St Andrew Kaggwa. It is recorded that Kaggwa, a Ugandan who became a Roman Catholic, was beheaded on January 17, 1887. After the church was built, a wall reinforced with 17 concrete columns was constructed to protect the integrity of the wall surrounding the church.

Oh how time flies! and the truth is time does fly and as it soars on from day to day we may put on a few pounds get a grey hair or two and soon realise that we are not as young as we used to be. Time brings with it two inevitabilities- the longer we live the older we will become and the reality that we will not live forever. Most of us will be fortunate enough to reach retirement age and all of us will eventually die. Such is the nature of life. We each respond to time's gifts differently. Some may try to fight the effects of age by dying their hair, using anti-aging cream or leading a healthier lifestyle, and that's fine but regardless of who we are be it a neurosurgeon, economist, vegetarian, marathoner, priest or billionaire we will all one day come to the same end in life. The fortunate will one day retire but death will come to us all. Both of these circumstances require us to prepare financially, not just for ourselves but also for our loved ones. Retirement is the reward for years of hard work and it is a time that many of us plan to enjoy a leisurely life. In order for us to comfortably enjoy our Golden Years we must plan our financial affairs wisely. Interestingly, the term \\\"Golden Years\\\" comes from Greek and Roman mythology and represents a time that was considered untroubled and prosperous where people lived in ideal happiness. If we too are to live carefree and well off in that season of life we must plan and prepare for it. Traditionally, as Caribbean people we rely on our families and children to care for us in the retirement phase of life. In the past, many of us simply had a \\\"my children will mine me\\\" plan and most of our grandparents and even parents' generation found themselves ill prepared for a world with double digit inflation and skyrocketing food prices. We must prepare for the fact that our income from our pensions, savings and investments is now fixed and there will be no more salary increases or bonuses, while our expenses can spiral beyond our expectations. Having a fixed income with rising expenses can only lead to disaster. As individuals we cannot assume that the government or our children will mind us when we retire. No one can predict the future and the economic circumstances that may prevail. If you consider the current global economic situation, Governments across the world are trying to find ways to reduce the burden of the national pension systems on the nation's coffers. Some are cutting pension benefits while others are extending the retirement age; likewise companies are seeking ways to put the risk of pension benefits onto the member rather than have it be their obligation. A recent trend is the growing demand for defined-contribution pension plans by companies. Essentially, these plans focus on the monies invested or contributed by the employer during the period of employment and does not guarantee the level of the pension benefit to be provided upon retirement. Thus, under a defined-contribution plan you the employee will have less certainty regarding your pension income. As we mature in age the chances of our health deteriorating increases. Old age typically brings medical challenges and increased healthcare expenses. Thus, expenses which we previously didn't have to budget for now become an immediate and expensive priority. Without adequate savings, living out your Golden Years in comfort while also covering your medical expenses may become too large a burden to bear - especially if your health (or that of your loved ones) starts to deteriorate. As such, to prevent any unforeseen illness from wiping out your retirement savings, you may want to consider obtaining insurance, such as medical, critical illness and long-term care insurance, to finance any health care needs that may arise. But beyond your own needs, you have to consider your financial legacy. What will you want to leave for your children and grandchildren property an education capital to start them off in life Without a well-planned retirement nest egg, you may be forced to liquidate your assets in order to cover your own living expenses during your retirement years. This could prevent you from leaving an inheritance for your loved ones, or worse, cause you to become a financial burden on your family in your old age. The greatest challenge the future presents us with is the unknown... and it is the unforeseen illness, accident, circumstance or economy that we must also plan for when preparing for the Golden Years. There is no magic number when it comes to the amount of savings and investments that should be accumulated for retirement. But there are a few things that you should consider: 1. Decide on the age at which you want to retire 2. Estimate the annual income you'll need for your retirement years, say 80 per cent of your current annual salary in order to maintain your standard of living 3. Add up the current market value of all your savings and investments 4. Determine the effect of inflation on your savings and the return you'll need to earn to beat inflation 5. If you have a company pension plan, obtain an estimate of its value from your plan provider 6. Estimate the value of any government or national insurance benefits The most corrosive factor in planning for the future is the impact of inflation on the value of your money. Once your savings and investments earn a return below the level of inflation then the value of your money is eroding. Also, the sad irony is that the longer you live the more money you will need to have saved at retirement. Thus, start saving now!... unless of course you plan to live a short life. No one likes to think about death but it is the ultimate conclusion of life and thus we have to prepare for it financially. This article is intended to spur you into action and to reinforce the importance of you planning for the future. Seek out a trusted investment adviser and discuss your finances and future with them. Some of the likely solutions to preparing for the future will include: i) a deferred annuity that will provide you with an income stream in the future, ii) a portfolio of bonds, monthly income funds, deposits and fixed income investments that provide cash flows over a period of time, iii) dividend paying stocks that provide income, iv) investing in a property that you can rent out, v) universal life insurance that builds a cash value and that can provide for your loved ones when you transition on, and vi) home equity after years of paying a mortgage your property would have a value that can be monetised if needed or passed on to your heirs. No one knows what the future may hold but if we plan as best as we can and seek out expert advice we can ensure that the Golden Years stay golden and that we and our families will live life richly.

Just before it was expected to blow ashore in the evening, the National Hurricane Center announced it considered Sandy no longer a hurricane but a wintry hybrid known as a post-tropical storm. The decision was technical and based on the storm's shape and its mix of cold and warm temperaturesa distinction that meant more to meteorologists than the 50 million people still in peril. The storm's top sustained winds weakened only slightly, to 85 mph from 90. As it closed in, Sandy knocked out electricity to more than 1.5 million people and figured to upend life for tens of millions more. It smacked the boarded-up big cities of the Northeast corridor, from Washington and Baltimore to Philadelphia, New York and Boston, with stinging rain and gusts of more than 85 mph. It was expected to come ashore last night in southern New Jersey or Delaware, converging with two cold-weather systems to form a fearsome superstorm of snow, rain and wind. Forecasters warned of 20-foot waves bashing into the Chicago lakefront and up to three feet of snow in West Virginia. Airlines cancelled more than 12,000 flights, disrupting the plans of travellers all over the world, and storm damage was projected at US$10 billion to US$20 billion, meaning it could prove to be one of the costliest natural disasters in US history. At least two deaths were blamed on Sandy in the US: One person died in a storm-related traffic accident in Maryland, and a Pennsylvania man fell from a tree while trimming branches in preparation for the hurricane. US President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney cancelled their campaign appearances at the very height of the race, with just over a week to go before Election Day. The President pledged the government's help and made a direct plea from the White House to those in the storm's path. \\\"When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't delay, don't pause, don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a powerful storm.\\\" Sandy, which killed 69 people in the Caribbean before making its way up the Atlantic, began to hook left at midday and was about 40 miles south of Atlantic City by evening, moving west-northwest at almost 30 mphfaster than forecasters expected. The storm lost its status as hurricane because it no longer had a warm core centre nor the convectionthe upward air movement in the eyethat traditional hurricanes have, but it was still as dangerous as it was when it was considered a hurricane, according to National Hurricane Center spokesman. Pete Wilson, who owns an antiques shop in Cape May, New Jersey, at the state's southern tip and directly in Sandy's path, said the water was six inches above the bottom edge of the door. He had already taken a truckload of antiques out but was certain he would take a big hit. \\\"My jewelry cases are going to be toast,\\\" he said. \\\"I am not too happy. I am just going to have to wait, and hopefully clean up.\\\" New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said people were stranded in Atlantic City, which sits on a barrier island and was mostly under water late yesterday. He accused the mayor of allowing them to stay there. With the hurricane fast approaching, Christie warned it was no longer safe for rescuers, and advised people who didn't evacuate the barrier islands to \\\"hunker down\\\" until morning. \\\"I hope, I pray, that there won't be any loss of life because of it,\\\" he said. The storm's projected path would put New York City and Long Island along its dangerous northeastern wall, facing perhaps 11 feet of water. While the hurricane's 90 mph winds registered as only a Category 1 on a scale of five, it packed \\\"astoundingly low\\\" barometric pressure, giving it terrific energy to push water inland, said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of meteorology at MIT. \\\"We are looking at the highest storm surges ever recorded\\\" in the Northeast, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground, a private forecasting service. \\\"The energy of the storm surge is off the charts, basically.\\\" In New York City, authorities worried that salt water would seep through the boarded-up street grates and through the sandbags placed at subway entrances, crippling the electrical connections needed to operate the subway. Authorities also feared the surge of seawater could damage the underground electrical and communications lines in lower Manhattan that are vital to the nation's financial centre. Hours before landfall, there was graphic evidence of the storm's power. A construction crane atop a luxury high-rise in New York City collapsed in the wind and dangled precariously 74 floors above the street. Forecasters said the wind at the top the building may have been close to 95 mph. Off North Carolina, a replica of the 18th-century sailing ship HMS Bounty that was built for the 1962 Marlon Brando movie Mutiny on the Bounty went down in the storm, and 14 crew members were rescued by helicopter from rubber lifeboats bobbing in 18-foot seas. Another crew member was found hours later but was unresponsive. The captain was missing. In Maryland, at least 100 feet of a fishing pier at the beach resort of Ocean City was destroyed, and Gov Martin O'Malley said there would be devastating flooding from the swollen Chesapeake Bay. \\\"There will be people who die and are killed in this storm,\\\" he said. At least half a million people had been ordered to evacuate, including 375,000 from low-lying parts of New York City, and by the afternoon authorities were warning that it could be too late for people who had not left already.

Strangers in Trinidad, they met in Texas, married, and made a success of life. But Krishna and Rose Moonilal never forgot the homeland, and returned as often as they could, keeping ties with local family and friends. One close friend lived in the north coast village of Blanchisseuse, and the couple went visiting when they returned on vacation last November. It was on a trip back over the mountains along Trinidad's loneliest and most precipitous road, that Rose would die. She was killed in a crash that also brought out the best in the people of the village, who rescued the survivors and tried everything to keep Rose alive. However, it is also this incident that set in motion a series of unfortunate events that led to citizens having to pay $6.8 million to a private company to pull a firetruck from a ditch. The tow job done by Sammy's Multilift Services Ltd is now being described as a fiasco by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, and as an absurdity by people who were witness to the tow job. But first, the enduring and underrated goodness of Trinis. The Sunday Express contacted Krishna Moonilal on his cellphone last week. He was at the time driving to the home he once shared with Rose, a bank worker. Parked on the shoulder, he told his story. Moonilal said his wife, 54, was in the back seat of the car that day, sitting between relatives, as they climbed the north face of a mountain in the village of Morne La Croix, more than 25 kilometres into the Blanchisseuse/Arima Road. It was the afternoon of November 17, a Saturday. Moonilal, 62, said he pulled aside to allow a truck to squeeze by, at a spot where the road had narrowed as a result of a landslide. \\\"The part of the road where the left wheel was located, started to collapse, and we went down in slow motion almost,\\\" Moonilal recalled. The Sunday Express visited the crash site last week. The vehicle could have tumbled more than 100 metres into a valley. Instead, the car snagged on a ledge. Moonilal said: \\\"The vehicle went down at an angle, and stopped. Everyone in the vehicle was hurt in some way. We needed help to get out. The people of the area helped us. My wife was the last to be taken out. The residents did CPR on her. I did CPR, but we could not bring her back.\\\" Moonilal, who suffered minor injuries, said he was taken to the Blanchisseuse Police Station for a breathalyser test. It was negative. An autopsy later determined that Rose suffocated. Her funeral was held in Trinidad. Moonilal said he may never recover from the loss of his wife, but will be eternally grateful to the people who helped. Moonilal's luck was that the car went over at a spot across the road from a house, one of only a few for many kilometres, and at a time when much of the village was there attending a birthday party. The response was immediate. The vehicle was secured to the wall with rope to prevent it from tumbling further. The injured were removed and lifted to the road above. All except Rose, who was unresponsive, and appeared not to be breathing. She had been injured under the weight of the others in the vehicle. Morne La Croix resident Alexis Contant, 22, said she took charge. She had only just completed a course offered at the Blanchisseuse Community Centre in search and rescue and survival training. Contant, an on-the-job trainee at the Brasso Seco primary school, was on her way home when she happened upon the scene. She said: \\\"They taught us how to analyse situations. How to react in disaster situations. So I asked, 'Any injured How many Is the lady breathing, moving They said 'no'.\\\" Contant said she went down to Rose, and helped bring her out. She was wrapped in tarpaulin and brought to the roadway. \\\"The lady's husband. He was asking for help. I remember falling to my knees and for 15, 20 minutes performed CPR. I had to tell the mister that I was sorry, but she is gone. He started to cry. He too tried to do CPR. It was a sad day for everyone.\\\" Contant, and everyone else living along the road, said if the route was maintained, Rose would have been alive today. \\\"When it happened, there were bushes growing at that spot, no warning and no barriers. If you did not know, you could not judge that there was a drop there. They came afterwards and built a barrier.\\\" And it is likely for a similar reason that Fire Service Water Tender 504 slid off the Arima/Blanchisseuse Road while responding to the crash involving the Moonilals. The distress call was received by the Arima Fire Station at 6.10 p.m. of the road traffic accident. The 504, left with six firefighters aboard. According to the official fire service record, the road collapsed under the left rear wheel as the vehicle negotiated a corner, and the truck skated downhill, off the road, and overturned onto the side. Injuries were minor and all six firefighters were able to leave the vehicle and return to the roadway unaided. The report stated that the truck was 120 feet (36 metres) from the road, and a few minutes drive past the entrance to the Asa Wright Nature Centre. At 7.10 p.m, a senior fire service officer (First Division) contacted the Central Division headquarters requesting a Land, Search and Rescue (LSAR) team be contacted and deployed to the scene, to have 504 stripped of all equipment, and the water (10,000 litres) drained. The water tender, when laden, has a maximum gross weight (MGW) of 27,500 kilogrammes. The LSAR team removed the water, hoses, ladders, jaws of life device (Holmatro), breathing apparatus, tools and wireless set. The job was done by 11 a.m. the following day. The vehicle, when unladen, has a weight of 10,000 kilogrammes. The job was observed by many of the residents traveling to Arima. Not a single witness interviewed by the Sunday Express estimated the firetruck to have slid further that 60 feet (18 metres) off the road. People expected to see a tow truck used by the Public Service Transport Corporation or Ministry of Works, to arrive at the scene. Resident Robin Walker recalled a failed effort by a second firetruck to rig a winch to a tree, to get the truck out of the ravine. He was there when the truck was finally removed, and saw an excavator being used to drag the vehicle onto the roadway. \\\"If people came down and saw this location themselves, they would know this (claim of 300 feet) is madness,\\\" he said. Resident Ronnie Jadoo, who captured video footage of the firetruck in the ditch, said he saw a wrecker and excavator involved in the retrieval, equipment no different from what is used on the quarries close to where the truck went down. No one can believe the claims being made to justify the $6.8 million expenditure. Those millions could have been used to repair the road, build barriers, and save the lives of citizens, residents said. The collapsed road which caused the firetruck incident has been cordoned off with a bamboo barrier and caution tape. The wrecked fire tender is back on the compound of the Chaguanas Fire Service headquarters. Purchased at a cost of about $2 million six years ago, it will be put up for auction and sold for its metal.

The people have never been in charge here. The alarming murder rate and the shameful inadequacy in dealing with the oil spill are symptoms of that 50-year deficiency at the heart of our country. Less than a decade into Independence, the people took to the streets calling for their power, but never got it. The 1970 eruption brought only symbolic change and the absence of the people's influence on national determination worsened over the ensuing four decades, producing a pervasive social and cultural decay, complete corruption of national life, political stagnation and levels of lawlessness and violence for which the nation has no answer in its present endangered state. The one factor which eventually saves a society, that awakened public consciousness and strong public opinion, the high politics, does not exist in T&T. It has been suffocated by a diseased tribalism. Almost half the population tolerates the corruption and incompetence of this Government; and the other half, to a lesser extent, will demand no accountability when the PNM rules the roost. The majority of people apparently love their political parties more than their children. This is the depth of corruption and irresponsibility that has led to this entire society being engulfed by the spreading swampland that I warned about two years ago. We remain a nation in name only, with no society whatsoever, an endangered place. You get alarmed when you think deeply about this country. It is now utterly leaderless, with dysfunctional institutions, a retarded constitution, antiquated governance, and an economy no longer generating the wealth to sustain our lifestyle. There is no security here. No one is in charge; the nation is a ship adrift on the high seas. Indeed our economic flagship, the energy sector, is the very symbol of national nonchalance. For 100 years we have been an oil producer but never developed the capacity to deal with industry disasters. Worse, the present oil spill is not due to accident but maintenance absent for almost 20 years, implicating both major political parties. Rusting pipelines beneath the ground serve as symbol of a country rotting beneath the surface, whilst we again get ready to trivialise ourselves with a decadent, meaningless Carnival, a country \\\"wining and jamming\\\" to the precipice. There is a clear danger to the economy, but no public to speak of it. People are lulled by business activity, consumerism and ostentation, forgetting it will all vanish like soap bubbles with the threat to our energy revenues. The Government speaks of economic growth, quoting figures that reveal stagnation but very few ask questions, including the Opposition, that epitome of intellectual laziness. There's no public to chastise their incompetence either. We were never called to responsibility for our society, never had the power that should have come with Independence, and so looseness, lethargy and mindlessness reign here, making this place easy prey for the unscrupulous and unworthy who abound in the politics of the country. Only politicians and their friends have a field day in this endangered place. After 50 years of Independence, oil and gas booms, our governance is shambolic and our major institutions disarrayed or dysfunctional. The most shameful is our Parliament through which we should have felt the people's power in national decision making. Our Parliament should have been that arena for fierce supervision of the Cabinet, for negotiation and collaboration between governors and governed like in the US congress, for example. But our house of the people has facilitated national degradation for 50 years. Instead of an instrument of the people's power, it is a place of ritual and \\\"grand-charge\\\", elementary in representation and laughable with its imitation grandeur. The Treasury is being raided every day before its eyes but it cannot protect the people's patrimony. What then is its use Why do we waste hundreds of millions of dollars every year on this impotence Did it prevent the gas station racket, Lock Joint, the Caroni Racing Complex, the Piarco Airport scandal and money laundering, the desalination plant, the Tarouba sporting complex Instead it voted unanimously three times for the treasonous Section 34.

And more \\\"mamaguy\\\" is coming with the Government's proposals for constitution reform. How will term limits stop the domination of the Parliament by the Prime Minister and bring the people into the decision-making process How will a fixed date for general elections empower our parliament with the resources and authority to summon public officials to investigative committee hearings which could lead to corruption charges against public officials Will our new constitution continue to split the annual budget for national security between a police service we need to be strong and an army we never needed at all Will we at last have one strong, adequately resourced security system under one central command Isn't this country too small for an elaborate system of army, police and coast guard, each inadequate, whilst the police cannot meet the demands of modern-day law and order Our worthless political class will never summon the courage to face the tough questions of governance, security and our stagnating economy.

A mid-morning disaster preparedness simulation exercise, conducted yesterday by the Tunapuna Piarco Regional Corporation (TPRC) at the Churchill Roosevelt Highway (CRH) and Macoya Road intersection, was a source of concern for motorists as it created traffic gridlock on the west-bound lanes of the highway. The exercise was undertaken in response to the call by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM) for organisations to participate in its 'Exercise Turbulence 2016' initiative. The exercise, in which two of the corporation's vehicles were overturned on the roadway, began at 11 a.m. and finished at 12.15 p.m. and was fashioned to imitate a road traffic accident resulting from an 8.4 earthquake. Rishi Siew, TPRC's disaster coordinator, said: \\u201cWe created an atmosphere where light poles were uprooted, trees strewn across the roadway blocking traffic and people lying on the ground suffering from injuries. \\u201cWe then tested the response time of all the emergency services\\u2014fire, police, Red Cross and the Global Medical Response of Trinidad and Tobago.\\u201d Siew said all the emergency services responded from their bases, with none being pre-positioned, since the objective was to evaluate their real-time response. \\u201cAdditionally, we had volunteers from our Disaster Management Unit play the roles of victims, with all the necessary props such as (fake) blood,\\u201d Siew said. He said the exercise, which got the approval of the corporation's chairman Edwin Gooding and chief executive officer Loris Romany, was well executed and well responded to. \\u201cThe drill was a tremendous success,\\u201d Siew said.

We recognise and celebrate a number of feisty women who bring us the news and function as editors, commentators and hosts of various media shows in print and electronically. But here's some breaking news: the perception is one thing; the actual figures tell a story. How have our women in the media actually been impacting and changing the sphere in which they work Global Media Monitoring Day, November 10, 2009 might have been an ordinary day at work for newsroom staff. It was, however, a special day for the Network of NGOs of Trinidad and Tobago whose team monitored T&T's news media to feed into the report Who Makes the News of the Fourth Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP). GMMP is the world's oldest and most extensive research on gender in the news media. It monitors women's voice/presence on national radio, television and print news. The GMMP exercise on that randomly chosen, fated day revealed a startling picture: 1. That presentations of women in the news had changed only marginally over the last decade; 2. That not unlike the global norm, the world that is reported in the news is mostly male; women continue to hover to near invisibility in the news; 3. Very little news just under 10% of all stories focussed specifically on women; 4. Overall, news stories were twice as likely to reinforce gender stereotypes rather than challenge them; 5. News stories on gender (in)equality were almost non-existent as in the 70-plus countries monitored; 6. Women were rarely central in stories that comprised the bulk of the news agenda. Less than 20% of news subjects the people who are interviewed or whom the news is about were women; 7. The sex of the journalist made a difference in whether or not women made the news: there were more female news subjects in stories reported by female journalists (25%) than in stories reported by male journalists (20%); 8. Expert opinion was overwhelmingly male with women comprising only 17% of experts who appeared in news stories; 9. As newsmakers, women were under-represented in professional categories. Although it may be slightly skewed in terms of representation of the general picture given its focus on one random day, the GMMP 2010 report does show that gender parity is still a somewhat distant prospect for T&T and indeed in many regions of the world. News was more often being presented by women but it was still rarely about women. On this randomly chosen day, women were outnumbered by men as newsmakers in every major news topic. In the Network's view, news media remain the major and most influential source of information, ideas and opinion for most people around the world. It is a key element of the public and private space in which people, nations and societies live. A nation or society that does not fully know itself cannot respond to its citizens' aspirations. Who and what appears in the news and how people and events are portrayed matters. Who is left out and what is not covered are equally important. Across the world, the cultural underpinnings of gender inequality and discrimination against women are reinforced through the media. Specifically, in the analyses, of media parity for women in T&T, who delivered the news in T&T On that day, 16 per cent were Women and 84 per cent were male; while the overall presence of women and men as news announcers in radio were 14 per cent female and 86 per cent male. Who are the newsmakers in Trinidad and Tobago Politicians and criminals. These two categories dominate with government officials, politicians, president, government numbering 26 stories on that day and criminal and suspect comprising ten stories. The Male to Female ratio in these two categories was 90 per cent versus 10 per cent, and 88 per cent versus 12 per cent, respectively. The presence of female and male news subjects in Trinidad and Tobago by medium radio, TV and newspapers showed Print- female subjects 24 per cent; male subjects 76 per cent. Other newsmakers were the police, military, paramilitary group, prison officers and in all instances featured men; similarly too for stories with lawyers, judges, magistrates, and legal advocate. The picture eased a little when it came to business persons, executives, managers, and entrepreneurs where women commanded some 23 per cent of the scene compared to men, at 73 per cent. In terms of gender functions assigned by/in the news, women were marginally seen as news subjects or experts/commentators (only eight per cent), and as spokespersons (only 34 per cent) with men commanding all three areas. In like manner, in construction social 'victims', in all categories victims were male subjects including areas such as accident, natural disaster, disease, poverty, domestic violence and crime. In 35 per cent of the cases, the news equated women's identity through representation of their family status, while such identity was ascribed to men in only 16 per cent of the cases. Significantly, female reporters identified men by their familial status 27 per cent of the time and women 25 per cent; while male reporters identified women 50 per cent of the time in this way and men only 9 per cent. Also significantly, female sources were equally sought by male and female reporters (50/50). However male sources were sought more by female reporters than male reporters (59/41). In effect, it also showed that female reporters reinforced gender stereotypes 100 per cent of the time and male reporters 94 per cent. This disparity however only represents one story in which the male reporter neither challenged nor reinforced stereotypes. Overall, the Network found that 'Politics and Government' was one of the most highly discussed topics and also represented one of the highest percentage differences between male and female reporters 74 per cent versus 26 per cent respectively. The gender gap was also strongly felt in topic ranked third 'Social and Legal' with 83 per cent versus 17 per cent and in 'Celebrity, Arts and Media' with 79 per cent versus 21 per cent male to women. 'Crime and Violence', however presented an almost equal figure of 51 per cent versus 49 per cent and women led only in two lower-ranking categories of Economy and Science and Health by small margins. Not unexpectedly, the overall presence of women was highest in relation to the least popular topic 'Celebrity, Arts and the Media' (64 per cent), while the two highest ranking topics 'Politics & Government' and 'Crime & Violence' presented the greatest disparities of men to women, with 93 per cent versus seven per cent; and 95 per cent versus five per cent respectively. Female subjects were present 100 per cent of the time in the following topics: Women's movement, activism, events, demonstrations, gender equality and advocacy, beauty contests, models, fashion, beauty aids, cosmetic surgery, and Celebrities, Arts and Media. Other high female representation showed 50-60 per cent representation in reporting related to: Education, child care, nursery, pre schools to University, adult education, literacy; Economic policies, strategies, models; Medicine, health, hygiene, safety, disabilities, medical research, funding and 'other' (minor) stories on politics and government. There was a male subject in 100 per cent of the time in 20 out of 50 topics and an overall percentage of 85. Some of the statistics are in the chart below.

It seems almost as cold as outside, as we settle down for our interview with Noriyuki Shikata, director of global communications at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But the public servants are not complaining about the temperature of the building. They casually explain to us that the government is leading the way in conserving energy. Everywhere there is evidence that the country is serious about this goal. The water in the taps in the rest-rooms at the restaurants and other public places is ice cold. And when we took a taxi the driver switched off the engine every time the traffic forced him to come to a stop. Japan is conducting a major review of its energy policy in which the saving of energy is one plank. Trinidad and Tobago with its heavy investment in liquefied natural gas would be happy to know that LNG is likely to emerge a major source of energy in this review. \\\"The proportion of LNG will increase...In terms of power generation, LNG is playing a bigger role,\\\" Shikata said. The accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan which came in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the attendant threat it posed to the people, has turned the population away from nuclear energy and has sparked a nationwide debate about Japan's energy policy. With 99 per cent of its oil coming from imports, Japan had pursued a policy of diversification away from oil and into nuclear energy for its energy requirement with a goal of achieving 50 per cent of its energy from nuclear power by 2030. And it was getting there. By March 2011, 30 per cent of its power generation was coming from domestic nuclear power plants. Now of the 54 nuclear reactors in the country, only five are operating, significantly reducing the country's reliance on nuclear energy from 30 per cent to three per cent. In the face of popular concerns and opposition to continued reliance on nuclear energy for its power supplies, the government is conducting stress tests at all the power plants. But there is a strong feeling that the nuclear reactors should be decommissioned. Shikata noted that under the current situation, given public opinion, it would be difficult to construct any new nuclear plants. \\\"But the government is hoping to see if it is possible to resume the existing operations at the current nuclear plants. But that is an ongoing issue,\\\" he stressed. If those 51 reactors (currently not operational) are not back up by the end of April, there will probably be no nuclear plants operating in Japan, he predicted. The new draft energy policy comes out for public comment in the summer. \\\"You are talking about losing 30 per cent of your power generation. The government is coming up with ways to address this. There is a resumption of coal and we are importing more gas, in the form of LNG. Compared to coal however, gas is cleaner and therefore there is a preference in Japan for gas,\\\" Shikata said. LNG now accounts for over 50 per cent of Japan's energy supply. The Japanese government has faced criticism that its cost assessment for nuclear power was underestimated. Nuclear energy was originally attractive because it was cheaper. \\\"But now there is a re-evaluation of the cost assessment if one has to take into account the cost for safety measures and extra requirements to guarantee 100 per cent safety. It adds up,\\\" Shikata said. He explained that Japan's nuclear power policy came after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 when Japan's economy was growing rapidly and there were fears that high oil prices could cause it to collapse. Then Japanese companies, like Toyota, responded to the challenge by producing more fuel efficient automobiles and these companies invested so heavily in energy efficiency that they became competitive globally. In fact Japan became the world's leading energy-conserving nation in the aftermath of the oil shocks. The Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on January 24 that the country faces the same challenge now in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake. \\\"The challenge is not to bring back the old Japan but to create a new Japan,\\\" he said. Japan gets its LNG from Qatar, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. On the possibility of importing from Caribbean and Latin American countries, Shikata said Japan needed to invest in countries like Trinidad and Tobago. He recalled that in the 1970s when it wanted to diversify its energy sources, Japan thought about importing oil from Mexico and Venezuela. \\\"But the reality of the global energy supply and demand is that there is a stronger pull from the US. So it seems easier for Latin America and the Caribbean exports to go to the US,\\\" Shikata said. The goals of Japan's new energy policy are lower dependence on nuclear energy power, more saving of energy and more use of renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy. Nine per cent of Japan's energy comes from renewable sources, with hydroelectric power being the dominant source. The government has given incentives to companies using renewable energy. Many of the nuclear reactors in Japan are located near the sea, because seawater is used in their cooling systems. Because of the huge tsunami last March, reactors at Yukushima which face the Pacific Ocean were affected when 14-15-metre tsunami waves hit the emergency diesel generators, flooding and crippling them, leading to a hydrogen explosion and the leakage of nuclear material into the environment into the atmosphere and the sea. There were two major leakages into the ocean on April 2 and May 11 when, in an effort to cool down the reactors, fire engines were deployed to spray water and cracks in the building which allowed contaminated water to leak into the sea. The contaminated water was found inside the port area and according to Koichi Shiraga, director at the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, these levels have been decreasing steadily. A water-shielding steel wall has been installed at the plant to prevent any more contaminated water from leaking out into the sea. This is being done at nuclear power stations all over the country as one of the lessons of this disaster is that there should be sea walls to prevent tsunamis from flooding the nuclear power plant site. The other lesson is ensuring that there are external power supplies. Next week: How the nuclear disaster has changed Japan's relations with the world.

I am thinking that this was a better country in which to live in the era of my youth, going back to my earliest recollections in the 1950s. But how could that be, what with readily observable affluence everywhere now Big houses, expensive vehicles, everyone with cellphones, trips abroad. There is certainly greater access now to education, to basic amenities such as water, electricity, and roads. We have embraced the information age. Whatever device is brought to the market today in a major metropolitan centre, we will have available here and on sale by morning. No, I do not doubt that on many objective measures we have come a long way. Yes, we are living longer now. But we are more jittery. We are afraid of shadows, for good reason. The galleries in houses are not used anymore. In the old days people sat in their galleries and watched others go by on the street. Or they looked out of windows. These were commonplaces. Now houses are fortresses. Burglar proofing is standard and is now an industry. People are locked inside once darkness appears. In the old days boys had childhoods. Pre-teen and teenaged boys in Marabella engaged in all of the seasonal cultural games. Top spinning, marble pitching, and kite flying. These were all communal games. During the summer vacation, we made slingshots. In cricket season we played gozeen. Young men in villages everywhere in this country ran foot races against each other, lamp-post to lamp-post, seeking bragging rights. In Port of Spain boys converged on the savannah, from everywhereBelmont, Gonzales, Harpe Place, and from up the hillto fly kite, or play football. Childhood and adolescence are stages we must all pass through. Many Afro-Trinidadian boys are not passing through these stages. They are being force-riped into manhood and into criminality. In his first week in secondary school, my young relative was accosted by Form Two boys who were trying to tax him. This is practice for a later date when they do the same to anyone who wants to come into their territory with a taxi, or who wants to open a little parlour. So boys are practising extortion in Form Two. In my youth the deaths that were reported most frequently in the newspapers were those caused by road accidents. Today they are due to murders. We saw a teenaged boy being held in protective custody recently. Wearing a mask he led the police to a grave in the woods. Young boys are defending streets and alleys with their lives. Boys who should be playing small goal and trying to get O-Levels. Or who should be in a technical school, learning how to design video-games, or how to make computers. But they stand as sentinels throughout the night watching for intruders from other streets. Where are the fathers or the step-fathers or uncles At 15 you should have to answer to somebody at home that you fear. And the women come to their limit as custodians of discipline when boys start trying to prove manhood on the block. Our country is now a world leader in crime. Ahead of big powers like Japan and the United States. In 2012 the number of murders committed in Japan was 506. This is for a population of 127 million people. This yields a murder rate of 0.4 per 100,000 people. The US state with the highest murder rate is Louisiana. In 2012, its murder rate was 10.8 per 100,000. The number of murders in Trinidad and Tobago for 2012 was 379 for a population of 1.3 million people. This yields a murder rate of 29.1 per 100,000 people. How did this once idyllic country get to become one of the most deadly places on the planet How could we be ahead of the United States and Japan in the rate of murders We certainly cannot blame politicians for that. I think we have to blame ourselves as a collective. Why have we gone so far in our callousness towards our fellow man Why are our youth, especially black youth, so uncaring about their brothers Why is the threshold for taking a life in this society so low We lost our way on the road to development. But why did the Japanese not lose their way Our society is adrift, and the reason is that we do not have a centre, a place to turn back to collectively, where we can recalibrate, and thus rejuvenated, start afresh. I am not talking about religion. I am talking about values. Our loss of the value of simpleness. Our loss of a rallying point. In times past neighbours would keep an eye on children so someone could go to the market. Children would play ring games on moonlight nights under the supervision of adults. Neighbours would bake bread collectively. But now we have lost or forgotten all of the foundations of the moral economy we once had. This is an economy that was founded on neighbourliness, trust, sharing, respect for elders. In that economy, children were children and adults were adults. Children knew their boundaries in dealing with adults. They knew how to address adults, and how to act in their presence. They knew that adults would tell on them if they saw wrongdoing. Grown men acted grown and thus commanded respect. Men who never went to school themselves provided encouragement to you as a boy, that you should go to school. A few days ago I heard on the BBC that tens of thousands of people in Japan are still residing in camps or other shelters far from their homes, ordered to do so when the tsunami struck the country in 2011, and the nuclear plant was breached. What we have not heard from Japan is that there is unrest among those who have not been able to go to their homes after this long. On that fateful day in 2011 the country suffered the triple whammy of a magnitude 9 earthquake, followed by a tsunami that killed 21,000 people, followed by a nuclear meltdown. The country as a whole reacted with stoicism. Japan has a moral centre, a place to which it can go in times such as national disaster. It has tradition and a culture of orderliness to turn to. I think that if we go back in history in this country, we will come to a time when there was civic harmony, when people shared sugar and flour, and when the watchful eyes of every adult were on a child playing in the street. We could look to Tobago for a glimpse of what the country used to be. We would see the power of simplicity. People respecting each other, strong family bonds, strong village bonds, fishermen helping each other, elders being revered, children being children and knowing their place. I think at some point when the country turned the corner materially, we failed to look back to see what we were leaving behind. It was not just the old-time Morris chair we threw out, or the old latrine that we pushed down. When petro dollars took hold we also threw away the moral/ethical software on which the country ran in the times when we were poor. We lost patience, honesty, and the work ethic. We lost values, such as honesty and integrity. We have to get back to the way we were. We are just an island where a bicycle sometimes makes more sense that a Ferrari. We have to get back to simpleness. Theodore Lewis, emeritus professor, University of Minnesota. * Michael Harris returns next week.

The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisher folk and people in poor coastal communities. The Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this country's worst environmental disaster. This is the second in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, head, Express Investigative Desk: Sea line No 10, the 40-plus-year-old fuel oil line that ruptured on an early December morning, was an accident waiting to happen. In addition to the severe external corrosion problems already identified, No 10 had five inoperable and leaking expansion joints, one missing in action altogether, leaking valves and flanges, segments of bare metal exposed, severely worn and loose safety wrappings, severely corroded chain and channel supports, cracks on support bolts and 41 identified areas where the channel beam support, including bearing plates and pile caps, were found to be severely corroded and perforated. Inspection Advice Ticket (IAT) 763/2013 which was issued on December 27, 11 days after the rupture on No. 10, found a range of safety hazards, including cracks on bolting hardware associated with the expansion joints, leaking gaskets and metal loss of between two to three millimeters. The inspection ticket laid bare some of the more vulnerable parts of Petrotrin's most famous sea line, which successive management and boards of directors at Petrotrin ignored, allowing No 10 to continue its business of transporting hazardous product as usual, that is, until December 17, when the line finally gave way. Petrotrin's own reports reveal that the company intentionally and knowingly failed to comply with industry safety standards. And as reported yesterday, its lead investigator on the December 17 incident, Mervyn Cummings, found that the refinery failed to follow its own mechanical integrity management plan. The architect of the plan, Gamini Hapuarachchi, Petrotrin's former head of Inspection Engineering, was clear that the ten-year inspection programme, if followed, would keep the refinery's marine infrastructure safe. The Hapuarachchi Plan He put it this way in his report: \\\"The ten-year sea line inspection programme was generated utilising the mechanical integrity report. This programme displays the inspection schedule for each sea line based on its risk ranking, location and service and inspection frequency.\\\" Noting that the sea lines were exposed to a marine environment, Hapuarachchi said: \\\"The corrosiveness of each line varies with the degree of exposure. Subsea lines are classified into two sections, above water as well as riser piping. Special care needs to be addressed to riser piping in the splash zone areas. \\\"These lines are exposed to a high degree of turbulence, thereby making them susceptible to an increased rate of erosion corrosion. These riser piping are rated as high risk lines and are assigned inspection intervals of two years. Recommendations are made to apply the required coatings or wrappings on these lines so as to maintain their integrity. \\\"The environmental impact played an important factor in the risk ranking of the lines due to the consequences of an oil spill and its effect on the environment and sea life. Samples were taken from failed sections of sea lines in various services. On inspections of these failed samples it was noted that the failure of the lines were primarily due to external corrosion. Internal corrosion of these lines were found to be negligible when compared to that of the external.\\\" The 2010 Hapuarachchi plan said: \\\"A risk assessment was carried out on each sea line where each line was ranked based on their probability and consequence of failure. The risk assigned to each line is based on the Risk Assessment Matrix implemented within Petrotrin. This classification is done for high, medium and low ratings for the sea lines, where high risk requires a two-year inspection frequency and medium and low requires a four to six and a six to ten-year frequency, respectively.\\\" \\\"A major factor that was taken into consideration in the determination of the consequences of failure is that of the availability of spare lines. Much emphasis is paid on the effect of assets and environment, if a failure should occur. It is assumed that the mode of failure of these lines being that of a corrosion hole.\\\" The only trouble with the Hapuarachchi plan is Petrotrin's failure to implement. \\u2014To be continued on Sunday TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

No way. So villagers of Siparia, who did not attend the funeral service for fallen boxing hero Jizelle Salandy at the St Benedict's Roman Catholic Church, La Romaine, yesterday, converged on the hearse as it arrived at the Siparia Public Cemetery and demanded that the coffin be opened. Not even the police were able to control the hundreds who waited in the blazing sun, some taking up vantage positions, to say farewell to their daughter of the soil. Several attempts were made to have the pathway cleared for the hearse to pass but the shouts for the coffin to be opened grew even louder. Unable to go further, the decision was made to give the mourners an opportunity to view Salandy's body. Caution tape, placed earlier by the police, was torn down and a mad dash was made towards the coffin. Police moved in, in an attempt to bring some order to the madness. At the graveside, where her mother was also laid to rest, Salandy's family and friends held on to each other and wailed openly while final rites, by members of a Baptist church, were being performed. Hundreds also turned up at the church in La Romaine to pay their respects to Salandy who succumbed to injuries suffered when the car she was driving crashed on the Beetham Highway, Port of Spain on Sunday. Former national U-20 footballer Tamar Watson, who was with Salandy in the car, remained a patient at the Port of Spain General Hospital, where she is being treated for several broken bones. The parade of dignitaries at the funeral service included President George Maxwell Richards and his wife Dr Jean Ramjohn-Richards, Sports Minister Gary Hunt, Culture Minister Marlene McDonald, San Fernando West Member of Parliament Junia Regrello, San Fernando Mayor Kenneth Ferguson, Legal Affairs Minister Peter Taylor; Opposition MPs Jack Warner and Winston Peters; Ambassador Joan Yuille-Williams and double Olympic silver medallist Richard Thompson. Thompson and fellow Olympic sprinter Monique Cabral were also involved in an early morning accident on New Year's Day, moments after leaving the 51 Degrees nightclub and lounge on Cipriani Boulevard, Port of Spain. Also present were Salandy's promoter, Boxu Potts, her manager Harry Ragoonanan and his wife, Senior Magistrate Lucina Cardenas-Ragoonanan, and calypsonian SuperBlue. Salandy, a Chaconia Gold Medal recipient, who would have turned 22 on January 25, was decked out in a boxing robe and a pair of red, white and black boxing gloves. In his eulogy, Fr David Khan said Salandy's death should not be looked at as a disaster but as the work of God. \\\"Jizelle left this world as the greatest world champion, so let not your heart be troubled,\\\" Khan said. His words seemed to bring little comfort to the bereaved. \\\"Imagine she left this world as the greatest world champion. That is how she will go down in history and God took her at that point. God took her after her last success. \\\"We have heard from so many (who have said) that they love Jizelle. I say to all of you who said you love Jizelle, you are to become, not as good as her, but better. \\\"The people of this nation, if we really loved this young woman, we should even excel beyond her so we can say 'I am the person I am today because of Jizelle 'Magic' Salandy'.\\\" Saying his words might be viewed as a sore point, Khan said every driver knew how dangerous it was to speed on the road but some just would not learn. \\\"It is a point which should hit home in our hearts. We know the things that are dangerous for us.\\\" Potts, who delivered the eulogy, said Salandy would go down in history as the most decorated boxer of all time and praised her humble nature. Hunt also addressed the congregation saying God chose the sport of boxing as an avenue for Salandy to serve her country. \\\"Jizelle won the hearts and minds of many citizens by the way she conducted herself in and out of the ring,\\\" Hunt said.

Offshore: Section of Petrotrin\\u0092s marine facility with its network of pipelines, the main transfer hub for the refinery\\u0092s petroleum products like crude, fuel oil, gasoline, aviation fuel and kerosene. crucial document: The Hapuarachchi ten-year sea line mechanical integrity report. Note the scheduled 2010 appointment for inspection tests for No.10 sea line which was not done. On a fateful December day when Christmas shopping occupied the minds of most people, a 16-inch diameter sea line broke at the State-owned refinery, sending a rush of black fuel oil into the Gulf of Paria and along the south western coastline. The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisherfolk and people in poor coastal communities. The Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this countrys worst environmental disaster in history. This is the first in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, head, Express Investigative Desk: FOR over a decade, State oil and gas giant Petrotrin ignored multiple leaks in its fuel transmission pipelines, safety warnings and its own recommendations to repair and replace aged and severely corroded infrastructure, including sea line No. 10, which ruptured last December 17 sending an estimated 7,453 barrels of fuel oil into the Gulf of Paria and coastal communities along the south western peninsula. In its push for increased production and bigger profit margins, Petrotrin rolled the dice in a high-stakes gamble which saw warnings go unheeded, essential maintenance pushed back and corners cut as it outsourced more of its work to private contractors with little or - in the case of No. 10 sea line - no attention paid to safety standards and industry best practices, Express investigations have found. From all accounts, including its own inspection records, audit reports, interviews with current and former officials, and other internal company data, Petrotrin knew about the potential and existing hazards identified with the continued use of poorly maintained and aged transmission pipelines. CARELESS ACTIONS The States biggest money spinner (liable for an annual $5 billion in petroleum taxes) had full knowledge that some of its marine assets did not meet strict industry fitness for service standards, yet continued, some say recklessly and dangerously, to push the safety envelope by using corroded, high-risk and leaky pipelines to move hazardous product. The evidence on record shows that the December 17 oil spill disaster could have been averted had the company paid attention to the long laundry list of inspection recommendations made by its own safety experts, including the phased change-out of the 1,875 kilometre-long No.10 sea line. Successive management top brass and boards of directors in the State oil and gas company failed to act on any of the several inspection reports related to No. 10 sea line, including a 1996 report which recommended a phased change-out of the severely corroded 40-plus-year-old sea line. Classified High Risk The failed line was issued an E3E ranking in an October 2010 diagnostic by then-head of Petrotrins Inspection Engineering department, Gamini Hapuarachchi, in a bid to overhaul key parts of the companys mechanical integrity management plan. The E3E classification is deemed high risk on the companys integrity evaluation Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM), which means it is almost certain to leak. It is also the third highest possible risk contemplated in the Petrotrin RAM and carries a bucket list of potential hazards in the event of a spill, including negative publicity and damage to the companys image, health and environmental issues and a $5 million hit in the pocket. Delayed Maintenance Petrotrins own records show that the company pushed back two crucial inspections in the years leading up to the rupture of the 16-inch, carbon-steel, above-water No. 10 sea line which the Hapuarachchi inspection report found had severe external corrosion. The line was scheduled to undergo visual inspection (VI) and ultrasonic thickness (UT-STD) tests in 2010 and a line inspection in 2011, according to Inspection Report 016-2010, the Hapuarachchi blueprint for keeping the refinery safe. Documents obtained by this newspaper reveal that the company, which posted a $2.5 billion profit in 2011, continued to play cheap with critical equipment maintenance schedules and spend big on experimental projects and plant upgrades. It shaded the truth and used selective data to present a skewed picture of efficiency and aggressive maintenance management. Worst Environmental disaster on record Company bosses read from the same script as they sought to deflect responsibility for what has been described as the worst environmental disaster in this countrys history. It denied union accusations that it failed to implement high priority schedule of works and countered that it adhered to industry best practice, namely the American Petroleum Institute (API) 570 standard. But did they In statements made to the media and full-page advertisements, the company held that it completed several inspections on No.10 sea line since 2006 and as recently as 2011. But its own internal investigation report into the December 17 incident shows that to be untrue The Petrotrin report, which reviewed historical company inspection data, found only three reports related to No.10, specifically: Inspection Advice Report No.0515 of 1996 (recommendation for phased change-out of sea line still to be implemented) Inspection Advice Ticket NTA 103/2006 (an advice ticket is not considered a complete inspection report and does not reflect work undertaken, if done at all) Inspection report 016-2010 (the Hapuarachchi report which examined all 40 sea lines at the Point-a-Pierre refinery, including No.10. The inspection recommendations contained in this report were not adhered to). The accident report failed to address the two scheduled inspections recommended for No. 10 in the 2010 report and made only a vague reference to the planned roll out of new two year inspection intervals recommended for identified high risk lines. No. 10 was among five high risk lines flagged by Hapuarachchi for urgent attention within a prescribed two-year period. Crucial Inspections Skipped The internal probe, which Petrotrin has kept under wraps since late January, said this about the Hapuarachchi plan to improve plant safety: Several sea lines should be inspected as per a given schedule, including No.10 sea line to be done by 2011. It said further that most of the sea lines, including No.10 should be replaced on a phased basis. The report by the four-member Petrotrin team, headed by process engineer Mervyn Cummings, made passing mention of Petrotrins failure to implement its own risk assessment process. It said this: Based on the data gathered, gaps were identified in the maintenance effort, asset integrity monitoring and the understanding and implementation of procedures. It was concluded that the failure of pipe supports for No.10 sea line expansion joint at Pile Bent 122 on the main viaduct led eventually to failure during the loading of the barge Marabella. Elements of planned preventative maintenance were in place but the implementation questionable. Failure to Meet API Standards The report fails to identify the gaps in question or why there were gaps at all given the 016-2010 Hapuarachchi blueprint which was copied to a roster of 17 managers including vice president, Refining and Marketing (R&M) Mado Bachan and senior manager of Refining Luke McSween. An electronic copy of the report and its attachments were also posted on the companys web. The Cummings report, however, admits in a roundabout way to Petrotrins failure to comply with API industry standards. It puts it this way: It was also concluded that the engineering support required to guide the process was either not engaged or not available. The report does not examine why this was so. Publicly, Petrotrin went on the offensive with tales of sabotage conspiracy and employee negligence. The company was quick to rule out safety lapses or willful neglect of pipeline assets it knew were on borrowed time as it defended itself against repeated claims of negligence and calls for an independent investigation by the bargaining union representing workers, the Oilfields Workers Trade Union (OWTU), fisherfolk, coastal communities harmed by the oil spill and other stakeholders. Company Lies It attempted to counter-punch union boss Ancel Rogets outspoken criticism of Petrotrin and his charge of negligence with a defence that the company operated a robust asset integrity management system and complied with API standards. But the companys own documents show this to be untrue. Petrotrins top brass Lindsay Gillette and Khalid Hassanali asserted that, contrary to Rogets claims, sections of No.10 sea line had been changed out in the last 24 months in compliance with industry standards. Public statements, advertisements and e-mail responses to questions from this reporter all maintained that any statement suggesting that there has been no inspection and/or maintenance performed on this line is incorrect. Official company statements identified the API 570 piping inspection code as the standard Petrotrin followed. Flawed Defence It went further, pointing out that the API inspection code recommends maximum inspection intervals for the various classes of piping systems, namely Class 1: 5 years and Class 3: 10 years. According to Petrotrin, No.10 sea line, falls within the Class 3 range. The company noted that: In keeping with the recommendations of the inspection programme, critical parts of sea line No.10 have been changed and work is ongoing. This defence is completely at odds with the Hapuarachchi ten-year inspection plan which used factors like age, historical data and corrosive condition of the line. Also, the API 570 classification for inspections is based on the premise of new and/or rehabilitated pipeline, not severely corroded and leaky 40- plus-year-old sea line. Hassanali, Petrotrins president, in an e-mailed response to the Express on what sections of No.10 have been changed out since the initial 1996 inspection report, said: Repairs have been carried out over the years in accordance with recommendations and most recently in 2013 approximately 200 ft of pipeline was changed. He did not respond to questions on whether the repairs were certified or whether it sufficiently addressed the severe corrosion issues identified in the 016-2010 report. Work on No.10 not Certified It also appears that he did not share this information with the team he appointed to probe the failed No.10 sea line. The Cummings report talks of a recent change-out (prior to the December failure) of 120 ft of pipeline on No.10 and apparent quality control lapses in supervising this pipe replacement job which was done in close proximity to the ruptured expansion joint. He made bare-bones mention of work done without inspection and/or mechanical and civil engineering input. According to him: This was evident based on the fact that there was no engineering input into the replacement of circa 120 ft of No.10 sea line that took place within the last few months. The line was replaced because of a leak, which was at first clamped, then the opportunity taken to install replacement pipe between two existing flanges. Cummings noted that: This replacement began at Pile Bent (PB) 124, which was close to PB 122, where the expansion joint failed. Pointing to the detailed planned preventive maintenance (PPM) blueprint developed by Hapuarachchi, he said: It appears that there is a lack of coherency and effectiveness regarding the implementation of the PPM program. He pointed to the high incidence of leaking glands in the fuel oil pumps in No.1 Pump house as further evidence that the PPM is not functioning as designed. Given his findings, it may not surprise him that it was actually 240 ft of pipe that was changed out on No.10. Also, there is no inspection documentation or mechanical completion certificates or any quality assurance/control documentation or individual inspection report that No.10 sea line was partially renewed before it dramatically gave way on that fateful December day - clear violations of the API 570 code.

One fuel tank wagon overturns close to the Gasparillo/ Petrotrin flyover on the Hochoy Highway and commuters from as far north as the CR Highway intersection, through all of central-south Trinidad, steam in their stalled or slow-moving vehicles for up to seven hours. And we lay claim to being on the brink of developed country status Give me a break! I was not in the traffic, but I first observed its deleterious effects when I took my ritual late-afternoon walk. The street on which I exercise runs off the Cedar Hill Road, Claxton Bay, not far from the Southern Main Road (SMR) Junction. When I got to the intersection, I saw the west-bound lane jammed with vehicles. They hardly moved. I had heard of the noon accident on the news, which also spoke of heavy traffic on the Hochoy and Butler highways, and advised motorists to use alternative routes. But I never imagined that at 5 p.m. people would be still stewing every-which-by-way, not to add being at a standstill on the highways. As I walked, I peered in both directions, looking for police officers. Not a uniform in sight. I hear sirens, presumably from ambulances trying to force they way through the logjams, to take patients for medical attention. Earlier, I had received phone calls from friends and relatives who were stuck in the mess and asking about alternative routes. I offered what advice I could, but it hardly helped. Later, on television news, when I saw images of Disaster Day, I was livid. Traffic was at a standstill, or barely moving, from as far north as the CR intersection. Trinidad had suffered a major stroke: its main artery was severed. From other reports, all ancillary roads, including the alternative SMR, were similarly stricken. Some wise fools (an oxymoron, I know!) decided to abruptly stop traffic in both directions as close as 150 metres to the overturned tank wagon. Had that tanker exploded, scores or people closest to it would have been blown to shreds or burnt to death. I am sure, too, infirm persons trapped in the jam must have suffered, maybe even died later, as a consequence of the torture they had undergone. Instead of a disaster plan, what the authorities inflicted on us was an unplanned disaster. What irks me most is that there were options available to mitigate the mess. In a situation like that, given where the accident happened, the Gasparillo and San Fernando police, as well as officers from nearby Petrotrin's security, should have been first on the scene. Fire officials from Petrotrin and San Fernando would be next: they focus on averting an explosion, which, in this instance, they did. Recognising the magnitude of the challenge, the senior police officer in the accident zone alerts the Police Commissioner who directs a senior officer to quickly evaluate the problem using a helicopter from the Air Guard of the Defence Force. While aboard, he notes the extent of the highway jam, and orders divisional chiefs to mobilise manpower to divert traffic from the highways onto alternative roads. He sees the feeder roads, as well as the SMR, similarly clogged. Clearly, there is need for maximum police personnel to keep traffic moving along these roads. The two new Augusta Westland helicopters move into action, collecting police officers and maybe soldiers in Port of Spain or Chaguaramas or San Fernando. The helicopters make several trips, and within two hours, officers are strategically deployed at key points on the highways, the feeder roads and most of all on the SMR. The helicopters use playfields nearest the \\\"trouble spots\\\" (mainly junctions) to drop off officers. They run to their nearby posts and immediately regulate traffic. This task is no high scienceI have seen civilians do it at accident spots. On the SMR, a major challenge is maxi-taxis that insist on stopping in the middle of the road to drop off or pick up passengers. If they insist on being boorish in the midst of a crisis, park them aside for the day! Traffic wardens should litter districts like Marabella, the San Fernando By-Pass, and similar alternative routes, again, keeping traffic moving. No parking is allowed on any of these clogged roads. So on the ground you have a few hundred officers dealing with a crisis situation, and in the air, helicopters patrol the clogged arteries hailing offenders (parked vehicles, for example), ordering them to get moving or get off the roads. Assuming such mobilisation got underway one hour after the mishap (1 p.m.), by 3 p.m. the sections of the highway closest (Claxton Bay to Tarouba) would have been clear of all vehicles, even if that meant having them drive in the wrong direction, to get them out of harm's way. With adequate officers policing the \\\"escape\\\" routes, traffic will have flowed, albeit at a slow pace. But such plan will have allowed for the disabled tanker to be made safe and removed from the highway by 3 p.m., restoring the free flow of traffic. There is much more I can write about handling such crises with military precision. However, if the best solution Minister Jack Warner can come up with is a ban on heavy trucks from the nation's roadways during daytime, what can a sober citizen say Go, Boyo, go!!

It is difficult to find support for St Joseph MP Justice Minister Herbert Volney in his St Joseph constituency. In the community of Bangladesh, in Farm Road, St Joseph, the Sunday Express could not find support for the representative who took over from the People's National Movement's (PNM) Kennedy Swaratsingh after the May 24, 2010 general election. A squatting community from its start, the \\\"village\\\" is in stark contrast to most of the constituency which, though still quaint in places, is obviously better off financially than the residents of Bangladesh. Most of the homes are in disrepair, with quite a few clearly constructed from cast-off materials. On one empty \\\"lot\\\", a pile of wooden shipping pallets were waiting to be taken apart and used to build and repair. Most of the members of that community who spoke last week were single mothers. They want jobs, they said, and better living conditions for their children. Many of them said they are not interested in working with the Community-based Environmental Protection and Enhancement Programmme (CEPEP). \\\"We can't mind our children on CEPEP,\\\" said Isha Ali, who attended a meeting held by Volney in the community last week to discuss the lack of employment in the area. It was at this meeting that Volney told the residents he had tried in the past to secure jobs for them with CEPEP but had been thwarted by certain councillors. Most residents said they, too, felt they were being used by some councillors as pawns in a political war, but they also admitted they were simply not qualified for any other types of jobs. Most residents were willing to speak but refused to give their names, for fear of being left out of any future work programmes. There were other issues they felt Volney could have solved by now, they said. \\\"The drains in the area real bad,\\\" said one resident. \\\"It have dengue in this village affecting our children.\\\" Another single mother said she has for months begged the San Juan/ Laventille Regional Corporation and the office of her MP to trim the trees around her modest home. \\\"It could fall on me and my children any time, and he not taking me on,\\\" she said. In St Joseph, Volney had more support. A number of people said they felt their MP \\\"was trying\\\", but they felt \\\"PNM elements\\\" within the area and in the local government councils were trying to make him look bad. \\\"They didn't take it nice when they lose,\\\" one man said. \\\"They making sure he hands tied now, so he will look like he not doing anything and don't care about the people.\\\" Retiree Leon Legall, 72, agreed and said Volney was \\\"one man trying to change a culture of laziness\\\". \\\"A lot of people here don't want to work, but they want money,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't take them on. I believe Mr Volney is trying his best, but he can only do so much. I also appreciate that he seems to speak his mind. He doesn't mix matters and says what he has to say without fear, whether it is outside here or in the Parliament.\\\" Still, there were detractors. One man, who did not want to be identified as he is employed with a State entity, said Volney has turned a deaf ear to them. The man claimed he and others have complained that the St Joseph Police Station has created congestion on Market Street by filling it with wrecked cars and vehicles that were involved in accidents. \\\"We tired complain about this, and Mr Volney has taken no action,\\\" the man said. \\\"Also, the Medical Associates Private Hospital has more or less taken away the public park from us in a number of ways. First, the children cannot play there because they say it is too noisy for their patients. So taxpayers are paying to upkeep a park that is of no use to the community. Then they burn their medical waste any time of day or night, and this makes some people nauseous. They also allow some of their wastewater to run through the main drains, and this is wrong.\\\" The man said some residents have also asked Volney to spruce up the main recreation grounds and add infrastructure to make it more user-friendly. \\\"We get nothing so far,\\\" he said. \\\"And where are the vocational courses for the youths We have a community centre that can be used for them to have classes. We need employment in this area, but the youths need help to get qualified. If Mr Volney is not careful, he will never win back a seat here again.\\\" See Page 20 for a response from MP Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan, following the March 18 \\\"MP Monitor\\\" story on her performance in the San Fernando West constituency.\\\"I'M doing my best,\\\" Minister of Justice and St Joseph MP Herbert Volney has said of his constituents' complaints. Volney said yesterday there were areas within his constituency which were \\\"not easy to manage\\\", and among them, the traditionally troubled squatting community of Bangladesh. \\\"The expectations of the people in this community are very high,\\\" Volney said. \\\"Their problems have been ongoing for years and have not been easy to resolve because most of them do not have the education.\\\" Getting a little tongue-in-cheek, Volney said: \\\"They want jobs that many of them do not have the education for. I will look for jobs for them in the Central Bank (of Trinidad and Tobago) and in the Office of the Prime Minister. If there are those who qualify, then they can have these jobs,\\\" he joked. \\\"Other than that, I will also look for sustainable jobs for them,\\\" he said. Volney said his office, for some time, has worked on relocating the community to a housing scheme, which he feels will help them to \\\"feel better and rise above Bangladesh as we know it\\\". Volney said since taking office, he has tried to furnish the community with employment from CEPEP but had no co-operation from some councillors. \\\"It has been a phenomenal disaster, and I have had to take over the seeking of the contracts myself,\\\" he said. \\\"So I hope this part of it will be resolved soon.\\\" Despite the claims of some constituents, he considers himself \\\"very and easily accessible\\\". \\\"There are three MP offices set up in my constituencythey are at Mt Lambert, St Joseph and Aranjuez,\\\" Volney said by phone. \\\"I see a lot of people through these offices, many of them from Bangladesh,\\\" he said. \\\"I have touched many people and helped many. I am trying my best.\\\" On the issues raised in St Joseph proper, Volney said he cannot help people if they do not make him aware of the problems. \\\"This is the first I am hearing of the Medical Associates issue,\\\" he said. \\\"If this had come through my office, I am certain we would have looked into it, but now that it has been brought to my attention, certainly, I will.\\\" The parking along Market Street of wrecked cars and vehicles that have been involved in accidents has been going on for over a year, Volney said, and he has spent almost as much time trying to change it. \\\"Yes, I am very aware of that problem,\\\" he said. \\\"I have written to the Commissioner of Police (Dwayne Gibbs) and the Deputy Commissioner (Jack Ewatski) on this. My requests to have the cars removed and the practice stopped have been ignored. \\\"This is one of the reasons I have turned completely against the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner. I am of the opinion that they need to pack up and leave our country because they cannot deliver, even on simple matters.\\\" Volney was thankful, however, for his supporters.

Steve Jobs, the Apple founder and former CEO who invented and masterfully marketed ever-sleeker gadgets that transformed everyday technology, from the personal computer to the iPod and iPhone, died on October 10, 2011. A memorial is shown outside of an Apple store in Palo Alto, California, on October 11. Steve Jobs, the Apple founder and former CEO who invented and masterfully marketed ever-sleeker gadgets that transformed everyday technology, from the personal computer to the iPod and iPhone, died on October 10, 2011. Europe took the financial world on a stomach-churning ride in 2011. The rising threat of default by heavily indebted European countries spread fear across financial markets and weighed on economies worldwide. As the year came to a close, banks and investors nervously watched Europe's political and financial leaders scramble to prevent the 17-nation eurozone from breaking apart. Several of the other biggest business stories of the year highlighted the global economy's linkages: A British phone-hacking scandal shook the foundations of Rupert Murdoch's U.S.-based media empire; a nuclear disaster in Japan stymied auto plants in the US and beyond; and the price of gasoline surged because of unrest in the Middle East and growing demand in Asia and Latin America. In the US, political squabbling led to the first credit downgrade for government debt, the economy suffered its fourth straight disappointing year and Apple founder Steve Jobs died. The European financial crisis was chosen as the top business story of the year by business editors at The Associated Press. The sluggish U.S. economy came in second, followed by the death of Jobs. 1. EUROPEAN FINANCIAL CRISIS. The government-debt crunch rattled Europe's financial system and weighed on the global economy. Portugal became the third European country, after Greece and Ireland the year before, to require a bailout as its borrowing costs soared. And investors grew worried that countries with much larger debts, such as Spain and Italy, would also need help. Financial markets were volatile all year as hopes rose and then were dashed that forceful steps would be taken to prevent the financial crisis from becoming Europe's version of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered a global financial panic and deepened the Great Recession. Banks worried that they or their partners wouldn't be able to cover losses if governments defaulted, so they cut back on lending. European governments, facing ever higher borrowing costs, reined in spending a policy response that is expected to stunt much-needed economic growth. Analysts estimate the slowdown in Europe, America's number one trading partner, will cut US economic growth next year. 2. BAD US ECONOMY: YEAR FOUR. The Great Recession may have ended, but the economic recovery continued to disappoint. For the first six months of the year, the economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.9 per cent. Growth improved to a two per cent rate in the third quarter and a three per cent growth rate is forecast for the fourth quarter. Still, 2 years after economists say the recession ended, 25 million people remain unemployed or unable to find full-time work. The unemployment rate fell from nine per cent in October to 8.6 per cent in November, providing a hopeful sign. Yet the housing market remained burdened by foreclosures and falling prices in many metropolitan areas. How to fix the economy became the top campaign issue for Republican presidential contenders. 3. STEVE JOBS DIES. The college dropout who helped popularise the personal computer and created the iPod, iPhone and iPad, died on October 5. That was two months after Apple Inc., which Jobs started in a Silicon Valley garage in 1976, briefly surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp. as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Jobs cultivated a countercultural sensibility and a minimalist design ethic. He rolled out one sensational product after another, even during the recession and as his health was failing. He first helped change computers from a geeky hobbyist's obsession to a necessity of modern life. In recent years, he upended the music business with the iPod and iTunes, transformed the smart phone market with the iPhone and created the tablet market with the iPad. 4. THE US CREDIT DOWNGRADE. The inability of political leaders to come up with a long-term plan to reduce the federal budget deficit led the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's to take away Uncle Sam's sterling AAA credit rating for the first time. The political bickering enraged voters, spooked investors and led to the lowest consumer confidence level of the year. But the nation's long-term borrowing costs fell after the crisis. The reason: US debt still looks safer to investors than almost everything else, especially European debt. 5. RUPERT MURDOCH AND THE HACKING SCANDAL. The man whose worldwide media empire thrives on covering scandal became the center of a dramatic one. A British tabloid newspaper owned by Murdoch's News Corp, which also owns Fox News and The Wall Street Journal, hacked the phone of a murdered schoolgirl. Murdoch was not charged with a crime, but an investigation by British authorities raised questions about Murdoch's ability to run his worldwide media empire. News Corp. fired several executives and closed the newspaper at the center of the scandal, the News of the World. 6. JAPAN EARTHQUAKE. An earthquake and tsunami that crippled the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor, owned by Tokyo Electric Power Co., cut off supplies of crucial Japanese parts and idled factories thousands of miles away. Auto companies, especially Toyota and Honda, were hit hardest. Inventory of certain models, especially hybrids, fell short at dealerships, reducing sales and sending retail prices higher. The worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl led countries around the world to reconsider nuclear power. Germany decided to abandon nuclear by 2022. 7. GASOLINE PRICES HIT ANNUAL RECORD.: The retail price of gasoline averaged US$3.53 per gallon for the year, eclipsing the 2008 record of US$3.24 per gallon. Americans drove less and switched to more fuel efficient cars, but it wasn't enough to offset the higher prices. A bigger percentage of household income went into the gas tank in 2011 than any year since 1981. Economists say the high prices shaved half a percentage point off US economic growth. 8. SOCIAL MEDIA IPOs TAKE OFF. Shares of the business social networking site LinkedIn more than doubled when it went public in May, recalling the froth of the dot-com boom. LinkedIn was followed by large IPOs from online radio company Pandora Media, online discount site Groupon and social gaming site Zynga. But the market is treacherous: shares of Pandora, Groupon and Zynga all traded below their offering prices soon after they were listed. Market anticipation is high for a Facebook IPO in 2012. 9. OCCUPY WALL STREET. On September 17, several hundred protesters gathered at a small plaza about a block from the New York Stock Exchange. They slept in tents, ate donated meals and protested income inequality and the influence of money in politics. The movement inspired protesters around the world who camped in city centers and business hubs to complain about unemployment, CEO pay and a decline in upward social mobility. 10. THE DOWNFALL OF MF GLOBAL AND JON CORZINE. The former governor, senator and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs lost control of a small brokerage firm he agreed to run in 2010. Saddled with huge debt and risky bets on European bonds, MF Global was forced to file for bankruptcy protection on Halloween after trading partners and investors got spooked. It was soon discovered that $1.2 billion in customer money was missing. Corzine told Congress he had no idea where the money went.

The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisherfolk and people in poor coastal communities. The Sunday Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this country's worst environmental disaster. This is the eighth in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, Head, Express Investigative Desk State oil and gas giant Petrotrin broke the law, aided and abetted by the state regulatory agencies tasked with the job of protecting life and the environment. State regulators, including the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources (MEEA) turned a blind eye to repeated safety violations in the thousands by the state-owned company which has shown a cavalier disregard for safety, the environment and the truth. The oil and gas giant, which is critical to the financial well being of the country was given a free pass by all of the State watchdog agencies and was left \\u2014 for the most part \\u2014 to its own devices to do as it pleased and take care of serious safety hazards as it saw fit or as in the case of No.10 sea line \\u2014 not at all. Continuing Sunday Express investigations show that the MEEA dropped the ball and allowed a major state operator to simply roll-over the annual laundry list of issued warnings with no consequence to how it does business or threat of shut down. No investigation about who inside Petrotrin made the call to skip crucial inspections or keep a weakened and severely corroded 16-inch sea line in continued and dangerous service. Petrotrin's free pass The line Minister and Government's chief regulator, Kevin Ramnarine showed no stomach for going after the rogue State operator which he acknowledged has consistently failed to act with dispatch on issued warnings in the thousands from the Ministry's Inspection Unit or Health, Safety, Security, Environmental/Measurement Division (HSSE/M). The man who is supposed to safeguard the wider national interest and ensure energy operators scrupulously follow industry best practices and comply with the law breached a duty of care by holding the State-owned oil and gas giant to a less stringent standard. In prepared remarks to a series of questions from Independent Senator David Small on April 2, Ramnarine admitted to Petrotrin's continued failure to tackle health and safety maintenance issues. \\\"The ministry conducts an annual inspection of Petrotrin's oil producing and storage facilities, and there have been instances where these facilities have not adhered to all environmental, health and safety practices as required by the MEEA,\\\" he told the Senate, adding: \\\"Where facilities have not adhered to these standards, a notice of deficiency is issued and the company is required to take corrective action.\\\" Getting away with repeated failures He read three years figures into the Hansard record, seemingly unperturbed by the high number of notifications which were in the thousands or the high rate and annual roll-over of unresolved safety issues in an already dangerous work environment which has claimed ten lives in the last decade. Ramnarine, who has refused to respond directly to this reporter's requests for answers to questions about the spill or related safety and oversight issues, on the specific Small question of whether the MEEA has considered \\\"sitting with Petrotrin to come up with a plan\\\" to take care of outstanding \\\"deficiencies\\\", said: \\\"That is exactly what the National Facilities Audit will accomplish. We have, of course to recognise that Petrotrin, though a company which is now 21 years old, sits on inherited assets that are, in some cases, close to 100 years old.\\\" He talked about the environmental mess left behind by the multinational energy corporations as though that was an excuse for Petrotrin's rogue conduct and continued failure to adequately appreciate risk and implement basic measures to protect the lives of its 5,000 workers and the environment. It has been the scripted response so far of company officials to why Petrotrin failed to follow the maintenance advice of its own experts. \\\"Petrotrin has inherited the assets and liabilities, including aged plant and infrastructure, of several predecessor companies. We continue to refurbish and upgrade as quickly and as economically as resources would allow. Regular and preventive maintenance are key aspects of our operations,\\\" Petrotrin president Khalid Hassanali said, in an e-mail response. As reported previously in this series, the company's former head, inspection engineering, Gamini Hapuarachchi had developed a ten-year integrity management plan to overhaul aged marine assets identified on Petrontrin's Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) as potentially dangerous and high risk. No 10 sea line was one of six identified high risk pipelines which missed two crucial scheduled inspections in 2010 and 2011. Coy with spill details Minister Ramnarine, who had early knowledge on December 17 of the Petrotrin oil spill and played coy with the details as the country worried about mystery leaks and the threat of unknown saboteurs, hedged his bets on the question of possible Government sanctions against the Lindsay Gillette-chaired board of directors and Hassanali-led executive management. \\\"That is a matter that could be considered for a future question,\\\" he advised the Senator, perhaps mindful of the several outstanding probes, increased public scrutiny and call for scalps by union boss Ancel Roget, who has been sharply critical of his and the company's handling of the oil spill. The minister talked about his Government's plan to launch a national facilities audit of the energy sector as a cure-all for Petrotrin's failure to take reasonable actions to eliminate identified safety hazards. He gave no account about what he has done to bring the renegade State-owned-and-managed energy giant to account since the disastrous events of December 17 or whether it is business as usual at the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery. Ramnarine, who went to Petrotrin's defence in the immediate aftermath of the oil spill and read from the same company cue cards, told the Senate on April 2 that: \\\"The ministry and, by extension, of course, the Cabinet has been very proactive. The Cabinet two weeks ago approved the plan for the national facilities audit of the energy sector, whereby the MEEA conducts safety and operations audits, on a periodic basis.\\\" The Government's big fix According to Minister Ramnarine: \\\"The national facilities audit is aimed at looking at the entire sector, not only Petrotrin but the east coast and Point Lisas and Point Fortin and so on, and I think, therefore, that is one policy position that we have taken post this oil spill that we really are ramping up the level of audit work being undertaken by the MEEA, as had been done by BP, as you know, over the last three years on their own facilities.\\\" (Post the Gulf of Mexico oil spill). He did not say who exactly would do this country-wide audit given the severe staffing shortage at the ministry's inspection unit or why Petrotrin is not being held to account for failing to follow its own integrity management plan or issued safety warnings from the State's regulatory agencies. Also, why there has been no consequence to Petrotrin's negligent conduct that led to the spill. No word either as to why he has not used his authority as the State's regulator-in-chief to issue a stop order to the energy giant responsible for the December oil spill. His response to the long laundry list of safety lapses and dangerous operating procedures by a State corporation that has repeatedly been caught lying has been muted as has his People's Partnership Government. Operating outside the law If Minister Ramnarine is at all worried that the State oil and gas company is operating recklessly and dangerously outside this country's HSE laws, he has not communicated that to the national community nor has he done anything about bringing Petrotrin to book over the thousands of safety warnings issued to the company. He has remained publicly silent on the issue. Weak State oversight and a severely understaffed and underpaid Inspection Unit in the MEEA were contributing factors that led to the environmental disaster, according to persons familiar with the situation. The inspection unit is the State's main agency overseeing the energy sector throughout the country and was so behind its workload it completely missed Petrotrin's marine facility when No.10 sea line dramatically burst open. The marine facility is a critical part of Petrotrin's daily operations and comprises a network of high pressure pipelines that are used to move crude and other hazardous product into and out of the Pointe-a-Pierre plant. Sources with knowledge of the situation say the refinery's marine facility literally slipped through the inspection cracks with no inspection audit conducted at the facility in five or more years. The unit is supposed to do annual inspections of all of the country's energy installations in both the State and private sectors. Persons with knowledge of the situation say the unit has been starved for critical resources and is currently operating with just 40 inspectors for all of the upstream and downstream industries, in all of Trinidad and Tobago, including rigs, seismic survey vessels, onshore terminals, offshore platforms, well sites, LNG terminals, bunkering warehouse facilities, petrochemical plants, road-tank wagons, transmission distribution pipelines and the whole spectrum of industrialised plants \\u2014 from methanol and ammonia to nitrogen and hydrogen (both state and private). Cultural failure Poor pay and an understaffed department struggling to keep up with the huge task of country-wide inspections led to vast regulatory gaps in the system, Sunday Express investigations have found. The network of distribution pipelines were among identified energy assets that had not been inspected by the MEEA when No.10 ruptured last December, sending over 7,000 barrels of bunker fuel oil into the Gulf of Paria. But even if the department had somehow managed to conduct the scheduled inspection with its limited manpower, the question remains about whether Petrotrin would have heeded the warning given the fact it knew the enormous risks it was taking by continuing to use lines identified as potentially dangerous and high risk by its own technical experts. The evidence so far shows a company that took calculated and dangerous risks given the known condition of No.10 sea line (recommended for change-out since 1996) and failed to follow its own integrity management (Hapuarachchi) plan, industry standards or warnings that the line was extremely corroded and would rupture if not upgraded. \\\"It was not a question of if it would rupture but when,\\\" said a Petrotrin source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Industry experts and former and current Petrotrin officials have painted a scathing picture of cultural failure at Petrotrin, citing poor management, lack of sufficiently trained technical professionals, failure to comply with industry codes, political interference and a company that puts profits before safety. Nobody minding the store Successive administrations have milked the State oil and gas company for all they could get, more interested in the billion-dollar deals and costly plant upgrades than on ensuring that the company operates safely and takes care of aged, badly maintained and vulnerable infrastructure critical to its business. The situation is further exacerbated by the failure of supposedly independent State regulatory agencies like the Environmental Management Authority (EMA) and the Occupational Health and Safety Agency (OSHA) to hold Petrotrin to account. Persons with knowledge of the situation say the December spill could have been prevented with better oversight. One HSE energy sector expert said the inspections don't go far enough. Perhaps most troubling, is the lack of prosecutions brought against the State oil and gas company by the country's two main oversight authorities. And it is not because of a lack of hard evidence. As reported in this series, Petrotrin's own inspection reports and other internal company documents have catalogued a long list of serious health and safety hazards that pose a threat to life and the environment. The evidence on record suggests that both State agencies have been less than rigorous in ensuring that Petrotrin stays safe. Worst yet, they rely in the main on voluntary compliance. Petrotrin's own data suggests that all of the State's oversight agencies \\u2014 including the State's regulator-in-chief and line minister \\u2014 failed to do their jobs. There has been no flood of penalties, no increased enforcement for safety lapses, no prosecutions for the near misses or accidents that have claimed lives or devastated coastal communities and ecosystems as far as 28 kilometres away from the spill site and no State directive to shut down the State energy giant until identified high risk safety hazards are fixed. Petrotrin untouchable Industry experts question the State's apparent reluctance to go after one of its own. A veteran oilman, who spoke on background, said the serious safety shortfalls highlighted in this series should have led to increased regulatory scrutiny of Petrotrin which has a worse health, environment and safety record than most. As reported previously, Petrotrin's failure to adopt a find-it and fix-it strategy following the December oil spill has led to six more oil and gas leaks (that we know of) for this year already. Experts inside and outside of Petrotrin say the company has systemic safety and health problems. They pointed to the company's poor safety culture where the main worry is \\\"how much\\\" a problem will cost to fix as opposed to \\\"how soon it could be fixed\\\". There has been a spate of serious safety incidents over the last decade and just as many deaths which raise questions about how Petrotrin was able to get away with breaking the rules for so long and why the state's oversight agencies failed to do comprehensive inspections of a known offender There are questions too about why the oversight agencies failed to rein in the culture of risk and breakdown maintenance that prevails at the State energy giant. Also, how did they miss the badly maintained and clamped No.10 with its worn hangers, weakened pipeline, leaking expansion joints and high-priority diagnostic Conflict of interest Perhaps the answer lies in the interconnected relationships between the central figures and the State's reliance on the Petrotrin money machine. Shyam Dyal, head, HSE Corporate at Petrotrin was deputy chair of the EMA up until a year ago. The Kamla Persad-Bissessar administration put an executive from an oil and gas company that is arguably the largest potential polluter (by nature of its operations) as deputy chair of the environmental watchdog agency. As to whether potential threats to the environment and the network of badly-maintained and leaking pipelines were overlooked as a result of this conflict of interest Chairman of the EMA, Dr Allan Bachan says no. But according to him, the EMA relies on Petrotrin to do its own voluntary monitoring and to provide reports of non-compliance to the State regulatory agency. In a short phone interview, the EMA chairman insisted that the agency's authority extends only to CEC (Certificate of Environmental Clearance) approved infrastructure and not petrochemical plants 100 years old. He claimed archaic legislation and understaffing as a defence for lax inspections at the State oil and gas giant. Dr Bachan refused to discuss the oil spill, saying only that the matter was still under investigation. Asked why the EMA failed to ensure that Petrotrin complied with the law, he again pointed to deficient legislation. But Section 16 (1) of the act gives the authority \\\"general functions\\\" to take appropriate action \\\"for the prevention and control of pollution and conservation of the environment\\\". Lack of enforcement The authority also has wide powers under Sections 47, 52, 58, 59, 60, 61 and 62 to do \\\"all things necessary\\\" to protect the environment. It also has the power to go after Petrotrin for criminal negligence under Section 70 of the act but according to Dr Bachan that is a difficult hurdle because: \\\"You have to prove it.\\\" Section 70 (1) states in part: \\\"Any person who through the release or handling of any pollutant or hazardous substance, knowingly or recklessly endangers human life or health, commits an offence.\\\" The EMA's position, according Bachan, is to allow the Government appointed task force of which he is chair to do its job. He did not say if the committee's remit extends to examining the EMA's role as a failed regulator. He declined further comment. Petrotrin was ordered to pay $20 million in fines related to its poor response to the spill 18 days after the incident. The identified breaches, however, had nothing to do with cause or the company's reckless and negligent conduct to take decisive steps to prevent the oil spill. The OSH agency which is mandated by law to ensure that employers provide a safe workplace did little more than the Inspection Unit of the MEEA. It simply wrote up a bunch of enforcement notices. The Agency, which has wide powers to enter a workplace without the benefit of a warrant, in an e-mailed response to a question about the slew of potential dangerous hazards identified in Petrotrin's inspection reports, said: \\\"Industrial establishments are targeted for compliance and enforcement activities by the OSH Agency based on risk profiling, risk rating and other criteria which include factors such as compliance history and accident frequency rate. Throughout the years several plants in the refinery have been targeted and compliance and enforcement programmes implemented by inspectors of the OSH Agency. Some of these compliance programmes were conducted jointly with officials of the MEEA, with reports of the findings being submitted to Petrotrin.\\\" State complicity Asked if the agency was aware of Petrotrin's pipe infrastructure problems and whether it did anything to ensure compliance to industry safety standards, the agency said: \\\"This question is vague and therefore does not lend itself to an informed response. However, assuming that reference is being made to the recent oil spill at Pointe-a-Pierre please be advised that this is an active investigation, and as a consequence we prefer to reserve comment, so as not to prejudice the process. We can confirm though that the situation has engaged the attention of the OSH Agency.\\\" What the agency neglected to say was that its attention was engaged only after the No.10 sea line failure. The agency which can make a demand for the production of company records and other data failed to respond to a question about how many accidents and fatalities were caused by some of the hazards identified in Petrotrin's own data over the last decade. What has emerged so far suggests that the EMA, the OSH Agency, the Inspection Unit of the MEEA and the Government regulator-in-chief, Kevin Ramnarine each played a part in protecting Petrotrin from the legal consequences of its negligent conduct. In the wake of the oil spill disaster, they have a duty to now tell the country why the rules do not apply to Petrotrin.

Because its predecessors were so delinquent in addressing real problems affecting citizens, the people are crying out for relief from the ills that affect them. Many voted for the People's Partnership out of sheer frustration over the way ex-prime minister Manning and his key ministers treated their concerns with contempt. Maybe their expectations are unrealistic. No government can reduce the levels of crime we have experienced over the past decade in a few months. I do not envy National Security Minister, Brigadier John Sandy, as he grapples with robberies and burglaries that have reached epidemic proportions, and murders that continue unabated. Sandy does have a major advantage over Martin Joseph: he has been in the trenches, having served in the Defence Force in varying capacities, from a private soldier to Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). He therefore understands the strengths and weaknesses of Defence Force personnel, and by virtue of his interaction with other arms of the Protective Services, he would understand their challenges too. I note that already he has indicated his intention to legitimise the SAUTT, a grossly-maligned unit that another of his military colleagues, Brigadier Peter Joseph, has built over the past five years or so. My understanding is that SAUTT is confined to gathering intelligence (information on criminals and their activities). In spite of the fact that its members are trained as an elite fighting unit, it does not have the power to act on the information it gathers. In other words, SAUTT is bogged down by bureaucracy. The UNC in opposition was very critical of it, saying it cost a lot but did little. Now they have the power to rectify this anomaly. That should bring greater firepower to bear on those who believe their right to terrorise entire communities comes from the barrel of a gun. There are many other measures that must be implemented if the Government hopes to reduce crime, first to manageable levels, and ultimately to insignificance. An overwhelming majority of the population are law-abiding citizens. Given the necessary assurances, they can play a pivotal role in reducing crime. A people's partnership must mean more than ministers and senators in government: it must signal a new era in which government partners with the people to address national problems. Meanwhile, Works Minister Jack Warner has tackled head-on some problems plaguing his ministry in a way only Jack does. He rolled up his sleeves, found himself in Caparo where residents faced a crisis caused by irresponsible sand-mining practices. Within 48 hours he got Energy Minister Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan to halt sand-mining in that general area. It's not that the new government is against quarryingI should hope not. It's simply that too many quarry operators have been a law unto themselves, they have ignored environmental concerns, damaged rural roads, made living hell for nearby residents, and they got away with it. This cannot be allowed to continue. The PNM Government talked about it, but never acted. Jack showed up Colm Imbert for what he isn't, and that in short orderno pun intended. Jack's other initiative, a declaration to move the main operations of the Licensing Department to Central Trinidad, is most welcome. Decentralisation of ministries and critical state agencies has been touted for 30, 40 years, but without any affirmative action. Since our current network of roads and highways makes no part of the country difficult to access (a PNM boast), shifting operations of agencies like Licensing would make life easier for both employees and the public. I hope the minister acts on this with dispatch. I must, however, warn Mr Warner (sounds good, eh) that his proposal to open up the Priority Bus Route (PBR) to the public is a disaster-in-the-making. I understand the urgency with which he wants to alleviate the horrendous traffic jams motorists face on a daily basis trying to access Port of Spain. But opening up the PBR to the public, even for limited periods and with pre-conditions, is a recipe for chaos. If anything, the PBR needs to shed some of its current traffic-load. I know what I write about since I use the PTSC bus service to travel from Chaguanas to POS during weekdays. Already there are too many vehicles on that special road. But in off-peak periods, the bus takes around half-hour to make the trip. With additional traffic on the PBR, commute-time will increase by 15 to 30 minutes. Knowing Trinis as we do, every-man-Jack would rush to the PBR to \\\"try out\\\" the new system. That will add yet another clogged artery to the city and it would defeat the purpose of the dedicated bus (and maxi-taxis) road. Because the PBR is a narrow, two-lane road that criss-crosses around 30 traffic lights/intersections, accidents will increase exponentially. Also, how many policemen would be required to ensure the proposed usage-rules are enforced I urge the minister to consult with traffic engineers and planners before executing any such plan. They may well advise that he not only leave the PBR as is, but he start construction of another dedicated bus and public transport road from Chaguanas to Mt Hope. That's one solution to North-South traffic woes. Implementing it would also signal the timely death of Imbert's $15 billion bound-to-fail rapid rail.

BW 523's runway mishap in Guyana will now increase the volume on CAL's flights, part gratitude part relief. Aviation incidents are usually related to human or mechanical issues or physical conditions: sometimes all three. This one will be figured out and ascribed a cause or series of causes. Even before that we learn a few things. CAL is not infallible and has a first major accident. Much can happen even after an aircraft safely touches down, so when you do applaud, stay buckled-in and keep in mind the job is not finished. We also know that Guyana is a lucrative market for CAL and not all airports are created equal. CAL needs some assurances in Guyana. It has to take stock of consistency in passenger and aircraft safety and emergency response. The initial sounds out of Guyana point to matters for concern and that is where the Prime Minister and Guyana's President will take the lead. With all of what has landed on the plates of the PM, Transport Minister and CAL's board it is funny enough that out of this incident CAL's beleaguered board may actually have found a unifying force, leading right up to the PM. The PM's visit to the crash site in Guyana is one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't things. I could not appreciate the reason for the trip at a time when the PM herself could do very little. The situation required technical and tactical responses and a political jaunt was not one of them. But later on I conceded that the trip was important in demonstrating both the level of oversight Trinidad intends to provide to the incident and the forward plan. It also demonstrates the PM's acceptance of responsibility: it is not just a CAL issue but a larger Guyana and TT issue. Guyana and Guyanese around the world are important to CAL. On most of those CAL flights out of Toronto and JFK Trinidadians are a minority and over the four seasons Guyanese and Guyana bound travellers are dominant CAL flyers. In fact on my CAL flight last May I was struck by the high level of Guyanese corporate advertising in CAL's fabulous Caribbean Beat in-flight magazine, a sign of Guyana's significance to the airline. This incident should have little impact on CAL's Guyana market as it currently lacks competition on the routes. But if the incident shows any sign initially of being related to physical or infrastructure issues in Guyana then CAL and the PM must act urgently. With the short- and long-term in mind, the involvement of both political leaders is welcome and the immediate focus has to be on the physical conditions BW 523 met that morning and the support given to the flight. The focus also has to be on Guyana's emergency response, though our current understanding is informed by anecdotes carried in the media. In Trinidad and Tobago then transport minister Jack Warner got caught in a national imbroglio in 2010 over runway lighting and contracts for it. At that time he emphasised the urgency, suggesting the country's international airports were very close to disaster given the inadequacy of lighting. It seemed at the time that we were winging it, since Warner pointed to deficiencies which had existed for a while and posed a persistent threat to aircraft and passenger safety. Could lighting or other infrastructure issues emerge as decisive or contributing factors in BW 523's runway mishap And if that is a factor, will we await a final report before we persuade Guyana to take action or will we act right away Sure enough Trinidad and Tobago may have taken its chances but assuming that lighting is or could be a factor, then Guyana was not as lucky. An aircraft snapped in two is no near miss. Could it also have been other infrastructure issues in Guyana Again we can await a full report or we can consider some of the passenger and crew anecdotes, the most critical of which will come from the persons piloting BW 523. There should also be a review of Trinidad and Tobago and all CAL's routes. We know that there were lighting issues at Piarco and Crown Point, but was that all of it The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Airports Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (AATT) and CAL will have to tell us what other risks passengers and aircraft may face at our local airports and elsewhere as CAL continues on this perennial hustle to even out the bottom line. And even with all the sensitivities, would human factors feature in this investigation into BW 523 A day's-old report into the June 2009 crash of Airbus Flight 447 is instructive. A Daily Mail, UK report says that the report emphasises that \\\"as their Airbus A330 rolled from side to side in a tropical thunderstorm, pilots 32-year-old Pierre-Cedric Bonin and David Robert, 37, were unable to bring it under control''. And \\\"even when Marc Dubois, the 58-year-old captain of the plane, returned from a rest break, his deputies were panicking too much to even tell him what the problem was.'' CAL has excellent staff and crew which must have contributed to the airline's safety record. Nothing suggests human error in this incident but a final report would surely consider how crew can better handle physical, infrastructure or mechanical challenges given the potential benefit of hindsight. Depending on who is saying it various descriptors will be assigned to BW 523's split into two. The spin doctors are already at work and \\\"crash'' is already a runway mishap: alternatively \\\"incident'', \\\"accident'', \\\"issue'', \\\"problem'', \\\"challenge''. It is what it is and that is a reminder of fallibility and vulnerability in the face of which BW 523's captain, crew and passengers have earned applause. Not just a smattering.

The effect of that spill is still being felt today by fisherfolk and people in poor coastal communities. The Express takes a close look at the chain of events that led to this country's worst environmental disaster in history. This is the sixth in a series of articles by Camini Marajh, head, Express Investigative Desk. Petrotrin's top brass, Lindsay Gillette and Khalid Hassanali, stayed on script over their handling of the December oil spill disaster even as they faced questions on key points about the company-issued version of events. Chairman Gillette, himself a former minister of energy in the Panday administration, defiantly maintained that unknown saboteurs were involved. Asked if he had any proof of this, Gillette, in an e-mail response to this reporter on March 21, said: \\\"Yes. The evidence that was available has been shared with the police and investigations are ongoing.\\\" As to what exactly that evidence might be, the chairman of the State oil and gas giant, who was an early proponent of the sabotage conspiracy, said only: \\\"I would prefer not to comment further.\\\" Hassanali, whose term as president of Petrotrin was extended for an additional two years 47 days before No 10 sea line dramatically ruptured, said: \\\"The number and chronology of the various incidents have been well reported previously and the company even took out full-page advertisements in the national media.\\\" Hassanali maintained that there were 11 spill incidents, including \\\"those of our business partners\\\", Trinity Exploration and Production Ltd and Neal and Massy Energy Resources Ltd. And, like his chairman, he hid behind the veil of an ongoing police probe to not disclose what evidence of sabotage the company has. \\\"The police was advised of all instances where sabotage was suspected and the relevant evidence was shared,\\\" he told the Express, noting that: \\\"For obvious reasons, we are unable to comment further on these matters.\\\" Petrotrin's top bosses and various Government officials, including line Minister Kevin Ramnarine had repeatedly asserted there was \\\"compelling evidence\\\" of sabotage in two of the 11 Petrotrin-reported spills, specifically Riser Platform No 5 and Rancho Quemado. Assistant Commissioner of Police Glen Hackett said yesterday the police are yet to come to any finding on the specific complaints of suspected sabotage. He confirmed that-south western division police have had several \\\"conversations\\\" with Petrotrin on the matter and that investigations are ongoing. He said: \\\"Given the national interest in the matter, we are moving with alacrity in the matter.\\\" However, as reported in last Sunday's Express, much of the company's so-called proof of sabotage just doesn't exist. The company's own investigation report into the RP No 5 incident made no such finding and put the blame squarely on a faulty rubber gasket. Much of the RP No 5 investigation report, including when the spill incident happened, contradicts the official version of events put out by Petrotrin and its top executives. Significantly, Petrotrin labelled the RP No 5 incident a \\\"deliberate act\\\" of sabotage before it had even appointed its team of company experts to investigate. The six-member team, headed by Dexter Hector, was appointed late in the day on December 23 and only began its investigations nearing year's end on December 27. The report itself was sharply critical of the lack of historical data, inspection reports and Management of Change (MOC) documents for repair work done on Riser Platform No 5, which forms part of Petrotrin's aged and poorly-maintained production and distribution infrastructure. The Hector probe also found that the accident investigation site on the eastern edge of the Soldado Main Field was not preserved in keeping with strict company guidelines and repairs to the busted rubber gasket were completed on December 19 before an investigation was even initiated. The report noted the team's inability to secure a \\\"list of physical evidence related to the blown gasket\\\", and the company's failure to keep a proper record of events, including the estimated start time of the spill. Company records report an alarm being raised by the captain of a marine vessel, C'est La Vie at about 12.30 p.m. on December 18, the day after the big 7,000-plus bunker fuel spill at the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery, which devastated miles of coastline and fishing communities along the south-western peninsula. The Hector Report found that, contrary to company claims, the response was slow and lacked critical booms and other spill-containment equipment. It also found that the company's first responders did not know what to do and apparently had no knowledge and/or training in oil spill response. It found that the company failed to follow industry standards for industrial pipe installation and maintenance. The gasket that blew was a wrong fit and breached several safety codes, according to the API (American Petroleum Institute) standard for offshore production platform piping systems, again contrary to Petrotrin's oft-repeated claims that it adhered to industry's best practices. The Hector probe estimated the size of the spill at about 40 barrels of crude oil and a leak time of about five hours, but conceded there were inconsistencies with the number of bags of Consorb or spill-absorbent material used. The report suggested that 50 bags of Consorb were used to contain the two Trinmar spills, specifically, RP No 5 and Platform 17. In the case of the latter spill, which was caused by a quarter-inch hole in a six-inch riser pipe, the estimated volume of the spill was said to be six barrels of crude oil. A leak time of three hours was given. Petrotrin insiders, however, spoke of an underreporting in the actual Trinmar spills. Persons with knowledge of the situation told the Express that about 1,000 bags of Consorb were used in addition to other marine assets to break up the spill. Hassanali has refuted reports that the executive management and board of directors of Petrotrin pushed the safety envelope by continuing to use old, corroded and leaky transmission pipelines to move hazardous product. \\\"Those allegations are not true,\\\" said Hassanali, stating that: \\\"The company has a robust Asset Integrity Management Programme, which exceeds statutory requirements. It includes planned maintenance schedules as well as preventive maintenance programmes based on periodic asset integrity and reliability inspections.\\\" This is at variance with the findings of this special Express investigation and Petrotrin's own inspections reports and other internal data. Both Hassanali and Gillette deny that the company operates on a system of breakdown maintenance. According to Hassanali: \\\"The company uses relevant and applicable codes and standards, including API and ASME, as well as industry best practices across its operations. Regular and scheduled maintenance is a key aspect of our operations.\\\" As reported in this series, several of the spill incidents, including sea line No 10, were caused by neglect of aged and under-maintained pipeline assets.

Because its predecessors were so delinquent in addressing real problems affecting citizens, the people are crying out for relief from the ills that affect them. Many voted for the People's Partnership out of sheer frustration over the way ex-prime minister Manning and his key ministers treated their concerns with contempt. Maybe their expectations are unrealistic. No government can reduce the levels of crime we have experienced over the past decade in a few months. I do not envy National Security Minister, Brigadier John Sandy, as he grapples with robberies and burglaries that have reached epidemic proportions, and murders that continue unabated. Sandy does have a major advantage over Martin Joseph: he has been in the trenches, having served in the Defence Force in varying capacities, from a private soldier to Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). He therefore understands the strengths and weaknesses of Defence Force personnel, and by virtue of his interaction with other arms of the Protective Services, he would understand their challenges too. I note that already he has indicated his intention to legitimise the SAUTT, a grossly-maligned unit that another of his military colleagues, Brigadier Peter Joseph, has built over the past five years or so. My understanding is that SAUTT is confined to gathering intelligence (information on criminals and their activities). In spite of the fact that its members are trained as an elite fighting unit, it does not have the power to act on the information it gathers. In other words, SAUTT is bogged down by bureaucracy. The UNC in opposition was very critical of it, saying it cost a lot but did little. Now they have the power to rectify this anomaly. That should bring greater firepower to bear on those who believe their right to terrorise entire communities comes from the barrel of a gun. There are many other measures that must be implemented if the Government hopes to reduce crime, first to manageable levels, and ultimately to insignificance. An overwhelming majority of the population are law-abiding citizens. Given the necessary assurances, they can play a pivotal role in reducing crime. A people's partnership must mean more than ministers and senators in government: it must signal a new era in which government partners with the people to address national problems. Meanwhile, Works Minister Jack Warner has tackled head-on some problems plaguing his ministry in a way only Jack does. He rolled up his sleeves, found himself in Caparo where residents faced a crisis caused by irresponsible sand-mining practices. Within 48 hours he got Energy Minister Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan to halt sand-mining in that general area. It's not that the new government is against quarryingI should hope not. It's simply that too many quarry operators have been a law unto themselves, they have ignored environmental concerns, damaged rural roads, made living hell for nearby residents, and they got away with it. This cannot be allowed to continue. The PNM Government talked about it, but never acted. Jack showed up Colm Imbert for what he isn't, and that in short orderno pun intended. Jack's other initiative, a declaration to move the main operations of the Licensing Department to Central Trinidad, is most welcome. Decentralisation of ministries and critical state agencies has been touted for 30, 40 years, but without any affirmative action. Since our current network of roads and highways makes no part of the country difficult to access (a PNM boast), shifting operations of agencies like Licensing would make life easier for both employees and the public. I hope the minister acts on this with dispatch. I must, however, warn Mr Warner (sounds good, eh) that his proposal to open up the Priority Bus Route (PBR) to the public is a disaster-in-the-making. I understand the urgency with which he wants to alleviate the horrendous traffic jams motorists face on a daily basis trying to access Port of Spain. But opening up the PBR to the public, even for limited periods and with pre-conditions, is a recipe for chaos. If anything, the PBR needs to shed some of its current traffic-load. I know what I write about since I use the PTSC bus service to travel from Chaguanas to POS during weekdays. Already there are too many vehicles on that special road. But in off-peak periods, the bus takes around half-hour to make the trip. With additional traffic on the PBR, commute-time will increase by 15 to 30 minutes. Knowing Trinis as we do, every-man-Jack would rush to the PBR to \\\"try out\\\" the new system. That will add yet another clogged artery to the city and it would defeat the purpose of the dedicated bus (and maxi-taxis) road. Because the PBR is a narrow, two-lane road that criss-crosses around 30 traffic lights/intersections, accidents will increase exponentially. Also, how many policemen would be required to ensure the proposed usage-rules are enforced I urge the minister to consult with traffic engineers and planners before executing any such plan. They may well advise that he not only leave the PBR as is, but he start construction of another dedicated bus and public transport road from Chaguanas to Mt Hope. That's one solution to North-South traffic woes. Implementing it would also signal the timely death of Imbert's $15 billion bound-to-fail rapid rail.

(AP Photo) Wreckage lies at the scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed shortly after takeoff at Hejere near Bishoftu, or Debre Zeit, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia Sunday, March 10, 2019. The Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia's capital on Sunday morning, killing all 157 on board, authorities said, as grieving families rushed to airports in Addis Ababa and the destination, Nairobi. (AP Photo) Authorities in Ethiopia, China and Indonesia grounded all Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft Monday following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner that killed 157 people, and investigators found the flight recorders from the field where the plane went down. The new plane crashed shortly after takeoff in clear weather outside Addis Ababa on Sunday, and the airline decided to ground its remaining four 737 Max 8s until further notice as \\\"an extra safety precaution,\\\" spokesman Asrat Begashaw said. Ethiopian Airlines had been using five of the planes and awaiting delivery of 25 more. As Ethiopia observed a day of mourning, Red Cross workers slowly picked through the widely scattered debris near the blackened crash crater, looking for the remains of the dead, while heavy machinery dug for larger pieces of the plane. The plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were found, Ethiopian Airlines said. An airline official, however, said one of the recorders was partially damaged and \\\"we will see what we can retrieve from it.\\\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak to the media. Ethiopian authorities are leading the investigation into the crash, assisted by the U.S., Kenya and others. \\\"These kinds of things take time,\\\" Kenya's Transport Minister James Macharia told reporters. Sunday's crash was strikingly similar to that of a Lion Air jet of the same Boeing model in Indonesian seas last year, killing 189 people. The crash was likely to renew questions about the 737 Max 8, the newest version of Boeing's popular single-aisle airliner, which was first introduced in 1967 and has become the world's most common passenger jet. Safety experts cautioned against drawing too many comparisons between the two crashes until more is known about the disaster. Besides the groundings in China and Indonesia, Caribbean carrier Cayman Airways temporarily grounded their Max 8s. Chicago-based Boeing said it did not intend to issue any new guidance to its customers. It plans to send a technical team to the crash site to help investigators and issued a statement saying it was \\\"deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the passengers and crew\\\" on the jetliner. People from 35 countries died in the crash six minutes after the plane took off from Ethiopia's capital for Nairobi. Ethiopian Airlines said the senior pilot issued a distress call and was told to return but all contact was lost shortly afterward. The plane plowed into the ground at Hejere near Bishoftu, scattering debris like a shredded book, a battered passport and business cards in multiple languages. \\\"I heard this big noise,\\\" resident Tsegaye Reta told the AP. \\\"The villagers said that it was a plane crash, and we rushed to the site. There was a huge smoke that we couldn't even see the plane. The parts of the plane were falling apart.\\\" Kenya lost 32 people, more than any country. Relatives of 25 of the victims had been contacted, Macharia said, and taking care of their welfare was of utmost importance. \\\"Some of them, as you know, they are very distressed,\\\" he said. \\\"They are in shock like we are. They are grieving.\\\" In Addis Ababa, members of an association of Ethiopian airline pilots cried uncontrollably for their dead colleagues. Framed photos of seven crew members sat in chairs at the front of a crowded room. Canada, Ethiopia, the U.S., China, Italy, France, Britain, Egypt, Germany, India and Slovakia all lost four or more citizens. At least 21 staff members from the United Nations were killed in the crash, said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who led a moment of silence at a meeting where he said \\\"a global tragedy has hit close to home.\\\" Both Addis Ababa and Nairobi are major hubs for humanitarian workers, and some had been on their way to a large U.N. environmental conference set to begin Monday in Nairobi. The U.N. flag at the event flew at half-staff. The crash shattered more than two years of relative calm in African skies, where travel had long been chaotic. It also was a serious blow to the Ethiopian Airlines, which has expanded to become the continent's largest and best-managed carrier and turned Addis Ababa into the gateway to Africa. The state-owned carrier has a good reputation and the company's CEO told reporters no problems were seen before Sunday's fight. But investigators also will look into the plane's maintenance, which may have been an issue in the Lion Air crash. The plane was delivered to Ethiopian Airlines in November. The jet's last maintenance was on Feb. 4, and it had flown just 1,200 hours. China's Civil Aviation Administration said that it ordered airlines to ground all 737 Max 8 aircraft as of 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) Monday, in line with the principle of \\\"zero tolerance for security risks.\\\" It said it would issue further notices after consulting with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing. China Southern Airlines is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the aircraft. The 737 is the best-selling airliner in history, and the Max, the newest version of it with more fuel-efficient engines, is a central part of Boeing's strategy to compete with European rival Airbus. \\\"Safety is our No. 1 priority and we are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this accident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved,\\\" the company said in a statement.
