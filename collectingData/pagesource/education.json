A woman and her lesbian lover were allegedly beaten by the woman\\u2019s husband after she confessed to an extramarital affair last Saturday. The suspect, a 48 year old fisherman, flew into a rage after the confession and allegedly beat his wife at their home in Charlieville. Police said when the wife called her lover and told her of the attack, the lover went to the house and was allegedly battered by the suspect and his 19 year old son. The suspect and his son allegedly ganged up and beat the lover with their fists and a cutlass, police said. The two women \\u2013the 43 year old Charlieville wife and her 47 year old lesbian lover - went to the Chaguanas police station that night and reported the incident to police. Officers took both women to the Chaguanas District Health Facility and they were transferred to the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex. The suspect\\u2019s wife was treated for minor injuries and discharged. Police said that the lover was severely beaten on the head and face, and was warded at hospital. She is being treated at hospital for a fractured jaw, perforated eye ball, sliced tongue and dislodged teeth, police said. Police said the husband also went to the Chaguanas District Health Facility on the night of the incident.

We were assured that there were sufficient surveillance technologies and safety officers in place. One expected that the MOE's response would include strategies for bringing about behaviour change in the population so that our people would be less inclined to act in ways that would bring pain and suffering to others. Indeed, the White Paper (1993) on Education, adopted in the past as a guide to educational policy, informs us that the education system of T&T is expected \\\"to establish and maintain the ethical and moral values necessary for civilised relationships .. in our society (p. vii). We have focused (with limited success) on preparation for work, and for further education, and have neglected purposeful and effective instruction in living in peace and harmony. I am not speaking of the lecture-based instruction in \\\"life skills\\\" and the nonsensical \\\"etiquette\\\" projects that privileged individuals have foisted on the nation. I am referring instead to well-designed initiatives that use practical learning tasks to engage students in real-life activities that can induct them into practices that will shape their consciences positively, so that they will experience remorse and guilt from the mere contemplation of hurting others. Some may argue that this should be part of the upbringing provided by parents, but I believe that notwithstanding the many capable parents around, there is an increasing majority who are incapable of aligning the moral compasses of their children. In this situation the education system should exercise its mandate in providing experiences to all students, from kindergarten to university, to shape their consciences positively and develop their appreciation for ethical conduct. We should not embed this kind of moral development in religious education offerings, but treat it as a separate subject with its specific objectives and methodology. In other words, students should be involved in caring behaviour and should directly confront the consequences of violent behaviour, without preaching and sermonising. If we neglect moral development the other school subjects become meaningless as preparation for life. This is the kind of revolution that we need in our education system. Our present curricula, from early childhood and beyond, neglect this imperative to make our population resilient to the enticements of criminal behaviour, and engender appreciation for moral and ethical conduct. The MOE needs to engage in serious curriculum reforms if we are to become a more civilised nation.

This is not only because of adolescent pregnancy, which has actually been dropping, but also because of far more serious issues such as child abuse. Ignorant of right and wrong in sexual activity, too many children remain silent when abused, with such abuse usually perpetrated by adults whom they know. A more open attitude toward sex education is an important part of reducing child sexual abuse, as well as fostering healthier attitudes toward sex which, in time, may also reduce the number of perpetrators. Unfortunately, we may never be rid of those who prey on the young and innocent, but with proper programmes in place in the school system, our children will be made aware of these despicable characters and raise a red flag in their own defence and that of their friends and classmates. It is no use turning a blind eye to these situations\\u2014that has already been done for far too long\\u2014and it is time to face them head-on by educating our children from early in life. Of course, there will be debate over the extent of what will be taught at primary school level, but there should be no further delay in implementing such a plan, so that when our children get to secondary school, they will not be naive in the way of the world and instead be assertive and confident about themselves, knowing fully well that their body is a temple and they should treat it as such. Unnecessary deliberation will only leave the window open for the deranged ones among us to continue to find innocent victims. The need for such an addition to school life was highlighted earlier this week by Dr Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN under-secretary, who spoke at the University of the West Indies' distinguished open lecture series. \\\"We at the UNFPA believe that comprehensive sexual education must be a part of education. The ability for the girl to understand, the ability for the girl to access correct information, and the ability for the girl to access services if she does require it is a basic right she must have,\\\" said Dr Osotimehin. \\\"We know for a fact that when girls go to school and stay in school up to the age of 18, they tend not to have children, and when they do, they have fewer children and they are able to make decisions for themselves,\\\" he added. So on all fronts, there is no doubt about the benefits of such an approach, from primary level right through the school system. Too many girls have had their lives thrown off the rails by an early pregnancy, with most of them being forced to leave school prematurely. In addition, their lack of higher education limits their opportunities in the world of work and they fall into a cycle of having children for any number of fathers. The right counselling and interaction with their male peers from an early age will allow both sexes to appreciate the need to respect each other and, in turn, limit the number of schoolgirls who have their dreams shattered by an unwanted pregnancy. Our young people are too vital a resource to continue to deny them the right to this basic knowledge that will guide them throughout their lives.

So with exams to prepare and grades to be submitted, I did not hear the Presidents speech. I was, however, struck by a headline which read Rose Hill RC, a success story. Now its rare to have a newspaper include Laventille or East Dry River and success in the same sentence, except maybe when mentioning Desperadoes steelband. For context, Rose Hill RC is an elementary school located in East Dry River, the part of the country that Trinis have been conditioned to fear. In reality, this fear surpasses the physical location and extends to anyone with connections to the region. The words success story grabbed my attention. The headline implied that Rose Hill RC was a successful school. I was elated and assumed that the definition of a successful school in T&T was similar to that used in the US, where there are quantifiable standards for evaluating schools. For elementary schools these standards include achieving certain state-established benchmarks in reading, comprehension, math and social science. The T&T Ministry of Education has generated a document titled Standard of Performance for Primary School Mathematics. The Assessment Strategies section of this document contains a laundry list of assessment tools few of which, if implemented, would result in quantifiable outcomes. Also, a search of the Ministrys website fails to yield data which are the product of these assessment tools. Because of this paucity of available data, I decided to examine a sort of surrogate standard: how students perform on the SEA exam, the data for which is readily available on the Ministry of Education website. With the assistance of an undergraduate engineering major who does research in my lab we performed rudimentary analysis of the SEA data for Rose Hill RC and compared the data with that of two other RC schools, Sacred Heart Girls RC and Sacred Heart Boys RC. For Rose Hill RC 16 per cent of the 2011 graduating class had to resit the SEA exam and 16 per cent were admitted to Tranquility Secondary and Belmont Boys Secondary while eight per cent attended each of the following secondary schools: East Morvant, Barataria North, Morvant/Laventille, St Anthonys College, Woodbrook Secondary and Diego Martin North. Compare this to Sacred Heart Girls School, where 71 per cent of the graduating class were admitted to Bishop Anstey High School, Holy Name Convent, Providence Girls, St Francois Girls, St Joseph Convent, Bishops Anstey East and Bishop Centenary. Additionally, for Sacred Heart Boys, 44 per cent of the graduating class gained admission to St. Marys College, Trinity College, Fatima College, Trinity East and Hillview College. None of the students who attended Sacred Heart Boys RC or Sacred Heart Girls RC had to resit the SEA. So, zero per cent of the graduating class of Rose Hill RC performed at a level which gained them access to any of the top ten high schools in Port of Spain. However a summary of the Presidents speech states that citizens should look at Rose Hill RC to provide the quality of personal and communal leadership the nation so urgently needs. If this is really true why arent the parents of the students at Sacred Heart Girls and Boys schools transferring their children to Rose Hill RC In the article, a representative of the Catholic Education Board of Management states that every schoolchild knows the difference between right and wrong. This comment is helpful because it may suggest that the problem is not with the children, but with the adults who cannot tell the difference between right and wrong. Is it right to have a school system with such glaring disparities in student performance Is it not wrong for adults (the Ministry of Education and the Catholic Education Board of Management) to turn a blind eye to underperforming schools A retired teacher of Rose Hill RC felt validated by all the hard work [they] have been doing. Am I missing something here Sixteen per cent of the graduating class had to retake the SEA exam and zero per cent gained admittance to any of the top ten performing high schools in the area and there is a sense of elation Job well done Maybe validation, but for the wrong accomplishments. Rose Hill RC prides itself on its mentoring programme that is full of volunteers who talk to boys and show them a different way of life. This programme is well intentioned, but why not develop an after-school and weekend tutoring programme which increases the students literacy and numeracy skills Maybe a programme such as after-school lessons, which prepares the students for the SEA exam Programmes such as these, paid for by parents, are widely available to middle class and upper class children but are lacking in schools in communities which serve the poor. The mentoring programme has as another goal -- to show that with appropriate support young persons are capable of acting in a responsible manner. Do you really want responsible adults How about providing these students with an educational experience which makes them competitive for admission into the top secondary schools Entry into one of these elite schools puts students on a path into the middle class where responsible behaviour is the norm. The article provides a quote which best explains the cause of the yawning gap in students expectations. A retired teacher is quoted in the article stating that the mentoring programme has been a success but with each child it is a different measure of success. The sore that festers in the T&T education system is finally exposed. What is whispered or goes unsaid is that the education systems expectations for poor children are quite different than those for middle and upper class children. T&T is constantly seeking to identify the factors which lead so many of its young into a life of crime. Maybe its not how low they wear their pants, not that they pray less than their grandparents, or not their love of rap and dancehall music. Maybe they are simply the products of a failed education system. * Charles M Hosten is a professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at Howard University TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Despite education and training receiving the largest slice of the 2012/2013 budget ($9 billion), the deputy principal of the University of the West Indies (UWI) feels that for this heavy expenditure we should be getting better, more comprehensive results not only for individuals, but for the entire society. \\\"We really need to look at the quality of our education,\\\" said Prof Rhoda Reddock. \\\"I think our education system is uneven and class-based. The poorest groups in the society who need the most support, the most facilities, they are not the ones getting this. So the education system basically reproduces the class and socio-economic structure.\\\" Reddock believes our system is overly competitive, with too early specialisation and based primarily on examinations from very early ages. It does not ensure that all children, no matter what their socio-economic background, are allowed to perform at their best. For children, education should be enjoyable, engaging and stimulating. In the past, when there was less expenditure on education, and fewer people attended high school, our primary school system was much more robust, she believes. The levels of education of students who left that primary school system were in some respects better than many of those coming out of the secondary school system today. \\\"Many teachers in certain secondary schools have given up and don't bother to teach because the quality of students who have come from the primary schools is so poor that it's almost impossible to teach the syllabus,\\\" Prof Reddock said. They too need support and a new vision for education in the society. She pointed out that some teachers do not have much faith in the students' capacity, so they limit their expectations of the students, which results in a self-fulfilling prophecy. She calls on committed teachers to form an education NGO to educate the public, especially parents, and lobby for a new vision of education. Although teacher education (especially focused at the primary levels) has been receiving increased attention at the University of the West Indies and the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT), the quality of teachers has to be improved. Primary school education needs to be revamped, she says, if secondary and tertiary level education systems are to perform at their best. The early childhood education system is now one of the best-performing aspects of the system, she thinks, even though teachers are paid less than $3,000 a month. \\\"I am proud to say that The Early Childhood Education Programme of the Faculty of Education at UWI contributed a lot to laying down standards for early childhood education across the country.\\\" However, she would like to see the university's education experts advising the Government about standards for a modern primary school education that truly enables and empowers all students and unleashes their full potential. \\\"We have 100 per cent secondary school access, which means that the Government pays for these children to go to school, plus pays for their exams. But yet, I think if we have 40 per cent who get five O-Levels that's a lot. If they didn't get five O-Levels but they got other things, we would be happy, but many of our young people leave school or drop out of school without critical skills and knowledge, without even the competencies to manoeuvre in the society. That is really missing. Something is seriously wrong with our education system despite the well-meaning efforts of some,\\\" she said sadly. The effort to have all teachers obtain university degrees in education is important. Teachers also have to be motivated and to be responsible for all children. Prof Reddock says there is a notion in Trinidad and Tobago that some children are academically inclined and others are not. However, all children have the capacity to attain a minimum level of education, she stated. After that, we can have differentiation but a certain minimum level of education is required for all young people to become competent adults especially in today's complex world. \\\"And most young people can achieve that,\\\" she insisted, \\\"even those with social, economic or other challenges. We know today that disabled children generally, with the right opportunities, can perform much better than they are doing currently in our society, although we now have some inspiring examples.\\\" Reddock, who was head of the Institute of Gender and Development Studies for a number of years, says with regard to crime, and boys' performance in school, \\\"I do think there are a number of structural issues that are affecting boys' performance in education. We in Gender Studies have researched this, we have written about this, we have published this, but we really need the society to take this on seriously. We need the Gender Affairs Division of the Ministry to be working with the Ministry of Education to see how these issues can be dealt with. We need the Institute of Gender and Development Studies and the Social Policy, Social Work or Criminology programmes at UWI to be working with the Ministry of Social Development in their social programmes.\\\" The education system is failing girls as well, contrary to popular belief, she emphasised. \\\"Girls may be faring a bit better. It is true that generally girls are doing better than boys, but if you look at all the girls and all the boys and using examination results as an indicator, then, the majority of girls are also failing and we need to recognise that.\\\" Today there is a general equation of education with certification i.e. successful education is getting a certificate or degree. This is inadequate and this has robbed education of its fuller meaning. Education is a tool of human and societal development and therefore a good education is imperative for the social, political, scientific, aesthetic and ethical development of any society. An understanding of gender by parents, by policymakers and by our political leaders could go a long way toward understanding many of our social problems, especially crime and criminal violence. Many of the problems with criminality are gender issues, Prof Reddock pointed out.

On the surface, this might appear to be true if the assumption is that a professional administrator is one who ensures that all the stakeholders in the organisation are treated fairly and openly, and that favouritism, bias, discrimination, and other unfair practices are minimal, if not totally absent. Administrators in all sectors are judged by the relevant stakeholders and, whether we like it or not, it is the majority view of the stakeholders involved that creates the public perception of the administrator with respect to traits such as personality, attitude, competence, and style. Principals, vice principals, deans, and heads of departments are all administrators and among those who \\\"judge\\\" them are teachers, parents, and students. Within recent times, increased emphasis has been placed on teacher education and teacher education programmes in T&T, as exemplified in the establishment of a new four-year Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) programme offered by the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT). This is a very commendable and impressive initiative, which is intended to ensure that there are well-trained, professional teachers to discharge the responsibility of educating our children. However, one cannot help but wonder about the impact of the older and/or traditional, untrained or minimally trained administrators on the entire initiative. How possible really is it for a newly trained teacherone who is excited about trying new pedagogy and innovative teaching/learning strategies in the classroomto work under an administrator who is fixed in the traditional paradigm Given, too, the fragility of the human ego, it is quite possible that principals who are not professionally trained will feel intimidated or even threatened by the increased knowledge base of their subordinates. In fact, teachers have complained of their efforts being rejected and even ridiculed by some principals who clearly fail to see the immense benefits of teaching/learning strategies such as role play, drama, and song, for the learning potential of students. Today, there are several primary schools in T&T that are led by principals and vice principals with only minimal professional training. Therefore, while the focus on training teachers is a noble one, the inherent problems of the resulting situation in which trained teachers are supervised by untrained administrators might defeat its nobility. If principals are not supportive and do not encourage their trained teachers to practise their acquired skills and techniques and to share these with their colleagues, many teachers would choose to \\\"abandon the effort\\\" rather than to \\\"persist in vain.\\\" The School of Education, UWI, St Augustine has been, over the years, attempting to institute programmes and short courses geared not only for teachers but also to target those administrators who may have moved up through the ranks, but who may be without the necessary professional training. The rationale, of course, is that pedagogically trained administrators may be less resistive facilitators when it comes to supporting and encouraging their teachers to make the necessary paradigm shifts. In addition, it is to be expected that institutions with properly trained leaders would be proactive and responsive to the needs of students in dynamic and creative ways. It is vital to remember that parents are significant stakeholders in the education enterprise. They will no doubt have cause to visit their children's schools on occasion and to interact with teachers and principals. Principals have to ensure that they do not interact with parents in a manner that might be interpreted as being confrontational, disrespectful, and unprofessional. Training is intended to provide the tools to equip administrators to deal with issues that require discussion, negotiation, and meaningful resolutions, and which are in the best interest of all concerned. The experts say that training is supposed to broaden minds and expand intellect, and that well-trained administrators realise that decision making and charting the way forward in any institution ought not to be the prerogative of the administrator alone but, rather, the collective responsibility of all those in the institution. Our administrators need to see themselves less as the boss and more as team players. This new image will no doubt require a conscious attitudinal shift and a new openness on the part of administrators if the paradigm shift is to become a reality.

This morning, thousands of little three-year-olds will arrive at early childhood education centres and pre-schools across the country, many of them clinging to their parents\\u2019 hands as they take their first step into the education system. While they move in, five-year-olds will move out and up into the primary school system. At another level, primary school graduates are taking up their places at secondary schools across the nation while at yet another level, secondary school graduates are heading in a variety of directions, including the skill trades, apprenticeships, universities and so on. It is an annual ritual marked by equal doses of thrill and tension for everyone involved, including students, parents, teachers, school administrators, the Ministry of Education and, not least, the travelling public. In the midst of this excitement there is hardly a school year that opens without its share of drama and this year is no exception. Even before the new school year opened, the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association (TTUTA) announced that teachers will be joining the call to \\u201crest and relax\\u201d on Friday in solidarity with Petrotrin employees and the Oilfields Workers\\u2019 Trade Union. Then there are the schools that will not reopen today due to damage suffered by the 6.9 earthquake two weeks ago. The Education Ministry has advised parents of children attending five schools that were seriously affected to keep their children at home: Curepe Anglican Primary School, Forest Reserve Anglican Primary School, Santa Monica RC Primary School, Dayanand Memorial Vedic Primary School and St Paul\\u2019s Anglican Primary School. The ministry was still to figure out what alternative arrangements would be made for the schooling of these children. Depending on how much structural damage has occurred and the cost involved it could be quite some time before the damaged schools are ready for student intake. Beyond the public schools, there is the ongoing dispute between the ministry and private schools regarding the fee paid for accepting students at the government\\u2019s expense. The Government\\u2019s current offer of $4,000 per student is a vast improvement on the $1,200 previously paid but still lower than the $5,000 demanded by private schools. Hopefully, this matter has been settled. One of the biggest challenges facing parents is the cost of textbooks, the burden of which shifted from the State back to parents when the Government terminated a substantial part of the free textbook programme as a cost-cutting measure in late 2016. In the age of online media, this is a problem that could be resolved with some imaginative resort to online teaching resources. One very welcome note of success over the past year was the reduction in reports of student violence following more structured interventions by the Ministry of Education using its students support services in collaboration with key personnel at affected schools. As they head out to school today, we wish all students the joy of learning. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

I shall begin with reference to Fr Martin Surju's third article (Catholic News, August 16). In this article he discusses the role of parents in assisting and motivating their children to be educated. He refers to the deteriorating situation over the years from a time in which illiterate parents often with great sacrifice produced children who are not only literate but progressed successfully in the education system to the present time in which illiterate parents may produce illiterate children. However having in his first two articles placed emphasis on the role of the school in achieving the education of children particularly if the parents were not performing their duty in this regard, and in his third article discussed the role of parents he concluded: \\\"But I have come full circle. Who is to break this cycle if not the school Education today is calling for a particular kind of teacher and Catholic education even more so.\\\" \\\"I think the CEBM (Catholic Education Board of Management) needs to do much more in alerting the Catholic public through the Catholic News on what's going on in our schools. I am sure they are doing some hard work; dissemination of information is the problem. Many persons expressed shock at my first article. Shock must not be the final word. It is a time for analysis, planning and action. We must set everything else aside. Catholic education and family life must be our concerns for the next 10 years.\\\" I have quoted extensively from Fr Sirju's three articles (with his permission) for he is in intimate contact with the Catholic primary school system which, he states, comprises 23 per cent of the primary system. It is my view that his articles should be reproduced in one or all of the national newspapers so that they may attain wider readership. Given that a substantial proportion of the primary school sector is the responsibility of the Catholic Church, improvement in Catholic primary education could have a substantial influence on the system as a whole, particularly on the Government-managed schools. In 2005 I wrote a series of articles in the Catholic News entitled: \\\"Can the Catholic Church lead the way for reform of the Education System\\\" In those articles I suggested that: \\\"The Church has control over a large section of the education system at primary and secondary level and therefore cannot escape some responsibility if the system is failing the country. The early involvement of the Church in education in this country filled a vacuum and provided education to those who otherwise would have received none at all. At that time only a favoured few were able to receive this education\\\". \\\"But as secondary education became more universal over time the system has become distorted so that a disproportionate quantity of the resources at some Catholic secondary schools (particularly the boys schools) go to potential scholarship winners. This means that the less brilliant but nevertheless able students who have the potential to become the backbone of any society are disadvantaged. The present system at some Catholic schools should be stood on its head! In other words the approach in Catholic schools should be to have small classes for less talented students and larger classes for the talented students. Students often learn their behaviour patterns from actions outside the classrooms in schools. The present arrangements at Catholic schools are sending a powerful message to young pupils at these schools \\\"to him (or her) that hath shall it be given and the devil take the hindmost\\\". No doubt the Church leadership has the moral authority to make the necessary changes. Does it have the insight and the will to do so\\\" The comments that I have made on the disparities in individual schools also applies between schools since some Catholic schools are performing well, others poorly. The emphasis that I have placed on Catholic education is not intended in any way to down play the important role played by other religious denominations who must also play their role in improving the education system. In this series of six articles I have tried to emphasise that: 1. the rights of the child should be enshrined in the Constitution and that the right to education should be included. However, since this could be interpreted as merely providing a school place, it should be expressed not just as the right to education but as a right to be educated. 2. there are serious deficiencies in the present education system that result in social inequity and by which we are creating a permanent underclass; 3. regrettably this could have ethnic implications and devastating effects on the future of our country; 4. it is essential that the link between poor education and crime be understood; 5. there is a grave responsibility to ensure a proper base for achieving social equity by educating all children in a system of high quality.

Professor Theodore Lewis Education in this country is a zero-sum game. Winners and losers. That is an old, anti-democratic model. Former People\\u2019s Partnership minister Fazal Karim recently talked about the \\u201cbest and the brightest\\u201d. Sat Maharaj boasted about the scholarships won by pupils at Lakshmi Girls Hindu College. But when we highlight only success, we deny ourselves opportunities to examine and to remedy failure. Education triumphalism\\u2014old fashioned boasting\\u2014by Sat, is what provoked Prof Courtenay Bartholomew\\u2019s letter in the Express of January 28, 2009. Sat was at it again at the recent dinner commemorating Indian Arrival, where he spoke of heroism Lakshmi Girls Hindu College\\u2014beginnings in cowsheds\\u2014and lectured about \\u201cemancipation of the mind\\u201d. Suruj Rambachan also was at it, speaking of beginnings in cow pens, and suggesting that Indians should now \\u201cbegin a national discussion on what it means to be a citizen.\\u201d One suggestion I have for Suruj would be to begin the discussion of citizenship by singing the anthem, which has a line that says, \\u201chere every creed and race finds an equal place\\u201d. When Indian indentured workers arrived here, an immediate and transcending bonus for them was that they could shed the weight of caste. Yet some today have revelled openly in the politics of race baiting and a discourse of racial superiority. Dominance in education is one thing but exclusionary education where the hijab is not welcome in the school yard is another. The story about cowsheds in the 1950s is highly embellished, and in the realm of Brer Anancy. Tanty Popo walked me up the trainline to begin school at Harmony Hall CM School in 1953. I was one of about a dozen black children there. The majority were from Union Village and Tarouba. All of the teachers except one were Indian. Those who were not monitors had been trained at Naparima Teachers College. The school was run by Mr Dookeran who lived in the headmaster\\u2019s house right next to it. There were no government primary schools in Marabella. I represented Harmony Hall CM in a road safety competition that took me, along with Sookdeo Bispat and Ralph Babooram, to other CM schools in South to compete\\u2014schools like Grant Memorial, Vistabella CM, and Canaan CM. They were not cowsheds. These schools are still standing. What Suruj and Sat should know is that throughout slavery the children of slaves were themselves slaves who had tasks in the fields from the age of six. Education in cowsheds would have been better than this. Now to the current education system in the UK. That system is diametrically opposite from what Sat and Suruj have defended in T&T. There is room in it for faith-based schools, but not exclusive faith-based enclaves. These schools are about education, where you question, not indoctrination. The current UK school system is comprised of two sectors, public and private. Private sector schools are referred to as independent schools. These are fee-paying. About ten per cent of children in the UK attend fee-paying independent schools, which are basically grammar schools. Public sector schools are of two basic types (a) academies, which are publicly funded, and (b) maintained schools. Some 72 per cent of secondary schools, and 27 per cent of primary schools are academies. These schools have a measure of autonomy over the curriculum and the terms and conditions of staff. One interesting dimension of the UK education system is the way in which it communicates information to the public, to be seen especially in the reporting of indicators of school quality. A key device for this is the league table, which draws from football, where at anytime during the season one can see the relative standing of each team. League tables for education rank every primary and secondary school. The data is made available on the Internet. For example, the league table for primary schools in 2018 tabulates the standing of 21,044 schools. The UK curriculum progresses according to \\u201ckey stages.\\u201d The league tables show school performance data for early stages (1 and 2) in reading, writing, mathematics, grammar, punctuation, spelling, and science. League tables for secondary schools in 2018 are also published. Results are shown for 6,374 schools. Schools are also given a score according to grades received by pupils in the GCSE exams. The 2018 league tables also provide data for the A-Level performance of 4,470 schools. The tables report the grades for pupils\\u2019 best three A-Level passes. Especially relevant to us here is the method by which a child in the UK gets into a secondary school. No, children do not have to compete with each other. In the UK the parent merely fills out a form indicating home address and which school in their locale is preferred. That form goes to the Local Education Authority. The child is then placed in a secondary school near home. Schools have to be on their toes, or they would be sanctioned by the Office for Standards in Education, Children\\u2019s Services and Skills, a statutory agency. Poor schools cannot survive in that environment as they do here. \\u2022 Theodore Lewis is professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

This has been the result of the hard work of successive colonial administrations and several religious denominations. Also, the People's National Movement (PNM) has been responsible for the type of education system we now have. Carl Campbell in his 1992 book, A Short History of Education in Trinidad and Tobago, 1834-1986 reported that by March 1981, Trinidad and Tobago had the most impressive education structure in the Caribbean. Commenting specifically on secondary education, Campbell pointed out that between 1981 and 1986, 80 per cent of the students of secondary age were accommodated in the education system of Trinidad and Tobago. Campbell also noted that this rapid expansion of secondary education introduced into public education the new problem of large failure rates (and to my mind, \\\"the jewels among pigs syndrome\\\"). A 1989 study commissioned by the National Alliance for Reconstruction confirmed that secondary education in T&T provides an essentially academic programme designed to fit its graduates for further education and employment at clerical levels. Klaus Borowka, the consultant responsible for the study, also admitted that secondary education in T&T (largely because of Dr Williams' vision of T&T as an industrial state) also contained a programme, which was oriented towards the technical/vocational skill areas and which also was meant to cater for those students who had made a clear decision as to the type of employment they wanted to engage in at the start of their working life. The 1985-1990 Education Plan also had much to say about the nature and dynamics of schooling in T&T. It also commented on the unpleasant trend of failure rates in our secondary education sector. Reasons highlighted were: poor intelligence and attainment on the part of students who sat the then Common Entrance Examination (now with the current policy of Universal Secondary Education one can imagine today's reality); inadequate preparation at the primary school level; the unusually wide ability ranges and student behaviours which tend to make classroom management and teaching extremely difficult in our secondary school; the failure of the then Senior Secondary or Comprehensive Schools to perform at optimum capability as a result of low and inadequate preparation of students at the level of the then Junior Secondary Schools; the practice of indiscriminately entering students (a process which has recently reappeared in the system) for the different external examinations whether they are prepared or not; whether they possess the necessary potential to cope with these examinations or not. As recently as 1991, in an unpublished paper I submitted recommendations to address the waste of human resources in our education system. Among other things, I recommended; the upgrading of the leadership in the Ministry of Education to secure more humane, visionary and professional leadership at this level; 2) appointing professionally trained administrators noted for their experience, understanding of the diversity and different sub-cultures which characterise Trinidad and Tobago society, and their philosophical base and not only for their paper qualifications; appointing and developing quality teachers who have a desire for ongoing training, research and innovation in our schools; recognition and application by the education system of the fact that there are other tracks to excellence besides the strictly academic path; increasing teachers' salaries to a level on par with a new appreciation for the importance of quality teachers in the system; inducing or providing standards for the professionalism and work ethic required among teachers in a dynamic and effective educational system; introducing policies and mechanisms which will ensure greater accountability on the part of school leaders, teachers, parents, and students in the system. Up-to-date research and investigation on my part reveal that all is not well in our education system. Many of our teachers seem neither to understand the significance of their contribution to nor cope with the imperatives of national development. Too many of our school leaders lack the personality, competence and passion to manage and lead their schools. Education for many of our children has become a commodity which can be compared to jewels among pigs. Indeed, too many continue to demonstrate an ideology which is inconsistent with national development. To my mind, in too many schools children seem to have taken over. Unless the Ministry of education focuses more on the holistic development of human resources rather than primarily on examination success, indiscipline and failure will continue in the educational system.

With no fanfare and like a thief in the night the Adult Education Unit, as we knew it, was disbanded by the Ministry of Education, on January 9, 2012. Adult education centres engaged mainly in craft (vocational courses) were transferred to the Ministry of Community Development. Some may argue that it was a progressive move as it sought to make adult education programmes community-based. Unfortunately philosophical reasons are not forthcoming and we are left to speculate as to the purpose of the change. This move brought to an end 40 years of continuous service under the aegis of the Ministry of Education. Since 1971, the adult education programme was annexed to the Ministry of Education with the establishment of an Educational Extension Unit, to organise and co-ordinate programmes of education extension. Before this, adult education had experienced a checkered past. Even during slavery, there were skilled artisans among the slaves and training of others was most probably achieved through non-formal means of apprenticeship and experiential learning. There were, however, popular movements in the 1930s and 1940s in Trinidad and Tobago where people were mobilised to participate in their own social and educational development, for example, the Negro Cultural and Welfare Association and the Indian Welfare Association that aimed at addressing the problems of illiteracy in particular. Formal attempts at adult education in T&T date back to 1943, with the establishment of the Social Welfare Department that assumed responsibility for the education of community groups (forerunners to the village councils) and began its adult education programmes with classes at ten centres in literacy, numeracy, civics, music and art. Between 1948 and 1971, adult education was shunted to the Department of Community Development under the Ministry of Social Services. Officers were mainly primary school teachers, who believed in the importance of community involvement in education and were themselves prominent in their communities. Some sought professional training but in the majority of cases it was felt that adult education was really an extension of primary schooling and that any good primary school teacher could have similar success in adult education. This perspective is still held by some policy makers. Some of the early stalwarts though were CLR Ottley, Phyllis Anderson, Olly Stanford, Olga Shurland, Eileen Armstrong, Ramcharitar Rickhi, George Sinanan, Jeremiah Saunders, Cyril Solomon, John Romano and Kelvin Branche. Allied programmes were established at other ministries in public health education, culture, agriculture, and at the Community Development Division of the Prime Minister's Office with the Prime Minister's Best Village competition. There was the establishment of formal institutions such as the National Training Board and the National Training Agency. In the face of the complexities and duplication, two private/public institutions are still respected for their work in \\\"popular'' education: the Extra Mural Department of the UWI (now the UWI Open Campus) mainly under the leadership of Esmond Ramesar and SERVOL led by a visionary priest Fr Gerard Pantin. Since 1997, there was growing stability in adult education with the establishment of lifelong learning centres offering approximately 69 different courses in adult basic education, technical/vocational education, enrichment activities, family life education, citizenship education, environmental education, and computer literacy as well as a growing interest in andragogy \\u2014the art and science in facilitating adult learning vis-a-vis pedagogy, and of course the progressive work of ALTA. With this momentum, by now, we should have established a sound professional adult education unit in the Ministry of Education, a unit that would have been the hub for research and policy on all aspects of adult learning and training. Of grave importance would have been its role in identifying barriers to learners' participation in adult education and the means to overcome these barriers. The unit would still have played a crucial role in the delivery of adult basic literacy and numeracy and other life skills. It would have sought to reduce the several duplications and discontinuities and allow for greater organisational coherence among government ministries and state agencies and the private sector that deliver adult education. Revival of its role in cultural studies and citizenship education would have been necessary with a focus on the lives of ordinary people, on historical memory and on critical understandings. Many progressive countries in Africa and Latin America also parts of India are adopting a similar approach with equal attention paid to non-formal and informal adult education. It was further hoped that in its new dispensation, a new cadre of researchers and practitioners in the field of adult education, for example, graduates of the Masters in Adult and Continuing Education of the UWI Open Campus would have taken their place in this transformed unit. The current move by the Government suggests there is really no amplified vision of adult education. There is talk among the power-brokers that education of the adult population is essential for sustained economic growth and development, but there is little evidence however that adult education is integrated into the educational sector much less national development planning. It has not been designed to serve basic development goals, at least not in terms understandable and convincing to curriculum developers and decision makers. What is worse is that there is also great confusion regarding the concepts of adult education, continuing education, lifelong learning, higher education and the parameters and application of these, leading to the resultant fragmentation across state agencies, non-government organisations and the universities. \\u2022 Lennox Bernard PhD (Sheffield) has been a teacher at all levels of the educational system TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

If they are taught to love and care for nature, and taught how important nature is to us, then they will be green and teach their children and friends to be green, and from there it will be spread,\\\" wrote Chioma Emesiani. These are the words used by the 16-year-old student of Holy Name Convent to describe her painting entitled \\\"It's easy to be green\\\", which stole the hearts of the judges and won the national poster and art competition on nature organised by the University of the West Indies' Family Development and Children's Research Centre (FDCRC). \\\"Mother nature is telling the little girl that if she really loves nature and her environment, then it's easy being green because when you see someone you love dying or suffering, you will do all you can to help them,\\\" added Chioma. Her stunning painting of a little girl with a map of the world imposed on her face, which took the top prize of $5,000 in units from Unit Trust Corporation, was selected from 202 entries by judges from the Creative Arts Centre at UWI. Chief judge Ken Crichlow, a respected artist and a lecturer at the Department of Creative and Festival Arts at UWI, said: \\\"I would really like to congratulate the FDCRC for giving the students this forum to channel their talents in this direction, and for the opportunity to express themselves. The visual arts are held so low on the curriculum that opportunities for this kind of expression are invaluable, and getting the students to engage in a very important issue, the environment, is really something to be applauded.\\\" Children aged five to 18 were invited to create posters using natural materials such as leaves, stones, seeds, roots, flowers and anything else they could think of to illustrate the main theme \\\"Reconnecting the world's children with nature\\\", with three themes\\\"it's easy to be green\\\", \\\"saving our earth\\\" and \\\"inside our outside\\\". It was a difficult task to choose from the two hundred submissions, as many were outstanding. \\\"The work that was done was really interesting,\\\" confirmed Crichlow. \\\"I had the benefit of looking at all the work. In terms of the imaginative reach, it spans from the ideal to the less than ideal, which tells you something about the intellectual make-up of the next generationthat they are no different from the present. I hope that the idealists will be able to live out the ideals.\\\" He said the pieces that were finally chosen reflected the high level of technical competencies available to our art students, which, he says, are really extraordinary. Judging the competition was an eye-opening experience for him, and it confirmed that the nation's children of school age have extraordinary abilities. Crichlow says he was overwhelmed by the talent and concepts that he saw in the submissions, and he doesn't know how such abilities can be converted into an economic life or a personal creative life, but he hopes that they will find their way in the world. \\\"There is no structure that exists right now to do that. Hopefully they are going to invent it.\\\" The poster and art competition is one of five initiatives that the UWI-FDCRC is currently undertaking as part of a worldwide campaign by the World Forum Foundation to reconnect two million children around the world with nature called Nature Action Collaboration for Children. The mission of the World Forum Foundation is to promote an THE WINNERS: From left, first, second and third place.ongoing global exchange of ideas on the delivery of quality services for young children in diverse settings. This mission is accomplished through convening gatherings of early childhood professionals around the world and by promoting the continuing exchange of ideas among participants. Current projects focus on men in early childhood education, AIDS and young children, nature education, peace education, teacher education, and immigration and young children. Dr Carol Logie, director of the UWI-FDCRC, is the Trinidad and Tobago Representative of the World Forum Foundation and a member of its International Organizing Committee (IOC). She is a lecturer in Early Childhood Care and Education in the Faculty of Humanities and Education. She has also worked as a preschool teacher in Spain, Canada, and the United Kingdom. During her 30 years of international and regional experience in the field of early education, she continues to be an advocate for children. The World Forum Foundation initiative to reconnect children with nature comes as a result of growing research that shows how fearful young ones are becoming about the natural world. Studies have shown that children's unfounded fears and misconceptions about the natural environment develop when they have very little actual contact with living things and obtain most of their attitudes through the electronic media. They are being exposed to frightening environmental issues at an early age, but are not first being given the opportunity to develop close personal connections with nature. Exposing children to environmental problems beyond their cognitive abilities, understanding and control can cause them to become anxious, tune out and develop \\\"biophobia\\\"a fear of the natural world and ecological problems. Research based on personal interviews with groups of children varying in age from preschool to age nine found that the attitudes children expressed towards various aspects of the natural environment (rain, wildflowers, trees, birds) included more expressions of fear and dislike than appreciation, caring or enjoyment. The first two years of life are considered a critical time for brain development. TV and other electronic media can get in the way of exploring, playing outdoors, and interacting with parents and others, all critical activities for learning and healthy physical and social development. As children get older, too much screen time can interfere with activities such as being physically active outdoors, reading, doing homework, playing with friends, and spending time with family. The UWI-FDCRC's work on the Nature Action Collaborative for Children is aimed at reaching 150,000 children and families in Trinidad and Tobago over a period of two years. Other initiatives include training for four members from the FDCRC's Family Development Project as well as 23 volunteers who were trained to assist with sensitising students in selected schools between October 2011 and April 2012. Most of these sessions were held outdoors to promote the many benefits of outdoor classrooms. They included art and craft, cooking, school gardening and journaling. The FDCRC's own early childhood and education centre had nature elements integrated into their curriculum, including the construction of a tapia house in the backyard. Murals were painted on school walls.

The Minister of Finance spoke of the construction of a campus for the College of Science, Technology and Applied Arts (COSTAATT) in Chaguanas, an integrated campus in Tobago and a multi-storey upgrade to the existing structure at the University of the West Indies (St Augustine campus). He discussed reform of the Government Assistance for Tuition Expenses (GATE) programme to eliminate wastage and abuse; and expansion of skills training. The Minister of Education spoke extensively of the achievements of his ministry in infrastructure development (school repair and building); distribution of Laptops, training of teachers in information technology, building of early childhood schools and training of teachers for these schools, development of technical vocational schooling, performance in Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) and Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE), teacher training for primary and secondary schools, arrangements for children with special needs, continuous assessment, curriculum development and publishing of textbooks. I shall not discuss all of these activities but I shall discuss some issues which were not highlighted by the minister. I listened to the Minister of Education being interviewed (by telephone) on the television this yesterday morning during which he described his visits to schools where he saw first-hand some of the infrastructure problems. While I have no difficulty with a Minister of Education visiting schools and seeing some of the problems this cannot replace a systematic monitoring of schools. This is supposed to be done by school supervisors but that system is glaringly inadequate and does not shine light independently on the system. I am unable to reconcile the achievements, praiseworthy as they may be, with what we see highlighted on the television news almost every night of the problems that school children, parents and teachers have with faulty infrastructure and absenteeism of teachers. Two young people when asked what they would like to have improved in their schools responded by saying that they would like better attendance of teachers. I shall now discuss (not for the first time in these articles) the following issues which I consider to result in major deficiencies in our education system: independent monitoring of schools, teacher absenteeism, school and classroom design and numeracy and literacy. Independent monitoring of schools. The Minister of Education is a medical doctor by profession so he will be well aware that the first step in addressing an illness is diagnosis of the problem. For proper diagnosis it is necessary to carefully collect and record the symptoms. In this diagnosis there must be no bias on the part of the doctor and on many occasions the general practitioner alone will not be able to do the job and so specialists have to be consulted. This is recognised in England where there is within the Ministry of Education an independent unit: the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) which reports directly to Parliament. In this system all schools are inspected at least once in every five years (more frequently if the school is not keeping up to a required standard). Inspections are carried out by a team of some ten persons, experts in different fields of education who spend a week at each school examining all aspects of the school's operations. Inspectors go into classrooms and listen to teaching, examine homework books, talk to teachers and students. The inspectors report on performance in individual subjects, particularly comparing this with previous inspections, comment in the report on the quality of teaching, on behaviour of students in the school. Comment is made on leadership in the school including leadership from the school board, on relations between the school and the community. The reports include assessment of the school's infrastructure. Two extremely important aspects of the Ofsted system are that the inspectors are trained and certified and each report is posted on the Ofsted website. At anytime the most recent report on any of the thousands of schools in England can be accessed. The names of individual teachers are not mentioned but each subject is accessed and appropriate comments are made. We should request help from Ofsted to set up a similar system in this country, particularly in the training of inspectors. Retired teachers should be recruited in the first instance. Teacher absenteeism. In this country teachers can take 28 (casual) days off and 14 days sick leave during term time. When I first heard of this arrangement I contacted a teacher in England and enquired how many days a teacher gets off a year in that country. I was told that there is no such arrangement for \\\"days off\\\". I then enquired how many days of sick leave were teachers entitled to each year. I was told that there is no such entitlement. If a teacher is ill the principal is informed and in due course a sick leave certificate is submitted. I was told that a class could not be left without a teacher for apart from the adverse effect on learning if anything should happen to a student under such circumstances the principal, the school board and the Local Government Authority would be liable. How do we solve this entrenched problem in Trinidad and Tobago Sometime ago a previous Minister of Education tried to assess the extent of the problem and came up with the answer that for seven schools 100 additional substitute teachers would be required. At that rate I calculated that we would probably have to double our present number of teachers. My proposal is that during salary negotiations (as are in progress now) Government should \\\"buy out\\\" these concessions which were no doubt introduced when teacher's salaries were low and the state could not afford to increase them significantly.

Census figures released last Tuesday highlight the latest education milestone for women, who began to exceed men in college enrolment in the early 1980s. The findings come amid record shares of women in the workplace and a steady decline in stay-at-home mothers. The educational gains for women are giving them greater access to a wider range of jobs, contributing to a shift of traditional gender roles at home and work. Based on one demographer's estimate, the number of stay-at-home dads who are the primary caregivers for their children reached nearly two million last year, or one in 15 fathers. The official census tally was 154,000, based on a narrower definition that excludes those working part-time or looking for jobs. \\\"The gaps we're seeing in bachelor's and advanced degrees mean that women will be better protected against the next recession,\\\" said Mark Perry, an economics professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \\\"Men now might be the ones more likely to be staying home, doing the more traditional child rearing,\\\" he said. Among adults 25 and older, 10.6 million US women have master's degrees or higher, compared to 10.5 million men. Measured by shares, about 10.2 per cent of women have advanced degrees compared to 10.9 per cent of men - a gap steadily narrowing in recent years. Women still trail men in professional subcategories such as business, science and engineering. When it comes to finishing college, roughly 20.1 million women have bachelor's degrees, compared to nearly 18.7 million men - a gap of more than 1.4 million that has remained steady in recent years. Women first passed men in bachelor's degrees in 1996. Some researchers including Perry have dubbed the current economic slump a \\\"man-cession\\\" because of the huge job losses in the male-dominated construction and manufacturing industries, which require less schooling. Measured by pay, women with full-time jobs now make 78.2 per cent of what men earn, up from about 64 per cent in 2000. Unemployment for men currently stands at 9.3 per cent compared to 8.3 per cent for women, who now make up half of the US work force. The number of stay-at-home moms, meanwhile, dropped last year for a fourth year in a row to 5 million, or roughly one in four married-couple households. That's down from nearly half of such households in 1969. By the census' admittedly outmoded measure, the number of stay-at-home dads has remained largely flat in recent years, making up less than one per cent of married-couple households. Whatever the exact numbers, Census Bureau researchers have detailed a connection between women's educational attainment and declines in traditional stay-at-home parenting. For instance, they found that stay-at-home mothers today are more likely to be young, foreign-born Hispanics who lack college degrees than professional women who set aside careers for fulltime family life after giving birth. \\\"We're not saying the census definition of a `stay-at-home' parent is what reflects families today. We're simply tracking how many families fit that situation over time,\\\" said Rose Kreider, a family demographer at the Census Bureau. She said in an interview that the bureau's definition of a stay-at-home parent is based on a 1950s stereotype of a breadwinner-homemaker family that wasn't necessarily predominant then and isn't now. Beth Latshaw, an assistant professor of sociology at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC, notes the figures are based on a narrow definition in which the wife must be in the labour force for the entire year and the husband be outside the official labour force for the specifically cited reason of \\\"taking care of home and family\\\". Her own survey found that many fathers who had primary child-care responsibility at home while working part-time or pursuing a degree viewed themselves as stay-at-home fathers. When those factors are included as well as unmarried and single dads, the share of fathers who stay at home to raise children jumps from less than one per cent to more than six per cent. Put another way, roughly one of every five stay-at-home parents is a father. The remaining share of households without stay-at-home parents - the majority of US families are cases where both parents work full-time while their children attend school or day care or are watched by nannies or grandparents, or where fathers work full-time while the mothers work part-time and care for children part-time. \\\"There's still a pervasive belief that men can't care for children as well as women can, reinforcing the father-as-breadwinner ideology,\\\" said Latshaw, whose research is being published next month in the peer-reviewed journal Fathering. She is urging census to expand its definition to highlight the growing numbers, which she believes will encourage wider use of paternity leave and other family-friendly policies. The new \\\"Mr Moms\\\" include Todd Krater, 38, of Lakemoor, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. Krater has been a self-described stay-at-home dad for the past seven years to his three sons after his wife, who earned a master's business degree, began to flourish in her career as a software specialist. Krater said he found it difficult adjusting at first and got little support from other mothers who treated him as an outcast at school functions. He eventually started writing a blog, \\\"A Man Among Mommies,\\\" to encourage other fathers to take a larger role in child care and says he now revels in seeing more dads at the park, library and school events. \\\"What was once an uncommon sight of a dad with the kids during the day is becoming more and more prevalent,\\\" said Krater, who is now studying part-time to become a registered nurse. \\\"But many still feel the pressure of gender roles and feel if they don't make money they are somehow less of a man.\\\" The census numbers come from the government's Current Population Survey as of March 2010. Among other findings: Among adults 25 and older, women are more likely than men to have finished high school, 87.6 per cent to 86.6 per cent. Broken down by race and ethnicity, 52 per cent of Asian-Americans had at least a bachelor's degree. That's compared to 33 per cent for non-Hispanic whites, 20 per cent for blacks and 14 per cent for Hispanics. Thirty per cent of foreign-born residents in the US had less than a high school diploma, compared to 10 per cent of US-born residents and 19 per cent of naturalized citizens. At the same time, the foreign-born population was just as likely as US-born residents to have at least a bachelor's degree, at roughly 30 per cent. Jeremy Adam Smith, author of the 2009 book The Daddy Shift: How Stay-at-Home Dads, Breadwinning Moms and Shared Parenting are Transforming the American Family, described a cultural shift as women began to surpass men in college enrollment in the 1980s. The 1983 movie, Mr Mom, openly broached the idea that out-of-work fathers can contribute to families as stay-at-home dads, allowing more men to be accepting of the role in subsequent recessions, he said. \\\"Over the long term, the numbers are just going to keep going up,\\\" Smith said.

That was the view of Acting Chief Educational Officer Harrilal Seecharan during an interview with the Express on Monday at the Ministry of Education, St Clair. Seecharan was commenting on the benefits of the Continuous Assessment Component (CAC) that will replace the SEA's current three- subject final exam format, which has been to the detriment of the children. \\\"When we have only 40 per cent of the students getting five and six subjects, including Maths, that tells you that something is wrong. \\\"The current approach where we've been focusing only on two areas has in fact derailed our entire education system. We are talking about 21st century skills,\\\" Seecharan said. He said the CAC will widen the skill set of the children and better prepare them to face the workload at the secondary school level. He added that, with the current system, \\\"we are not doing as well as we should\\\" and the CAC is 25 years too late. Seecharan said the implementation may appear as though the Ministry of Education was rushing it but that is due to the slow pace at which other programmes have been launched in the past. He added that the 12 days of training for the teachers will be conducted by curriculum and former curriculum teachers who are qualified to teach their subject areas. The subject areas that will fall under the CAC are: Character Education and Citizenship, Visual and Performing Arts, Physical Education, Agri-Science, Science, Maths and Language Arts. Seecharan said the biggest concern so far is the need for greater stakeholder engagement and responses in schools. He added that the necessary funds are available to equip the schools with both the physical and human resources needed to teach the subjects. He said the aim is to assist children who are struggling and bring them up to par with their excelling classmates while maintaining the high standard the exceeding pupils face. \\\"The CAC is part of a wider strategy that the Ministry of Education has which stems from two years ago following an assessment of the curriculum. The CAC is one of the priority areas that have been identified,\\\" said Seecharan, adding that ideas such as universal early childhood education, SEA date change and regular teacher training are some other initiatives to improve the system. He said the aim is to make learning fun and the CAC will provide avenues for both parent and child to be kept abreast of the child's progress. \\\"To ensure that the grading is reliable, a very rigorous monitoring system is put in place to ensure that the marks are fair, valid and reliable,\\\" Seecharan said. He added that the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) has been contacted to have the final say regarding the children's grade. Both the Ministry of Education and the schools themselves have the power to review the children's results, but only CXC can adjust their grades.

In the July issue, he again takes Dr Gopeesingh to task, notably asking for justification and validation of changes he is making, makes further other country comparisons and conducts analyses of aspects of the T&T system, plus an interesting reference to Vivian Stewart's book, A World-Class Education, and highlighting her four traits of high-performing education systems. Anent Dr Gopeesingh, as another clinical professional, I find that Dr Gopeesingh is treating the T&T educational system like a patient, ie, he has diagnosed certain pathologies (problems) in the system and, like the good doctor he is, and according to his training in dealing with pathology (problems), he is prescribing certain treatments (solutions). However, I suggest his approach is homeopathic, treating the symptoms, rather than holistic or going after the root causes of the problems (more on this in a bit), and looking at the problem from a public health perspective. Getting back to my point, what am I alluding to by my assertion I mean that the T&T education system is basically a failure, an anachronism, and no amount of plasters or Band-Aids is going to rescue it. And my condemnation includes the teacher training system (how they are trained), the lack of value placed on teachers and the total inadequacy in the way and amount teachers are paid. Modern educational systems in the Western world were initially designed for the transition from an agrarian to an industrial production-based needs societyin the 19th and 20th centuries. We are now, however, in the 21st century; a century with a new needs basis and a new paradigm. For example, in the US, in 1960, almost zero per cent of the US workforce was employed in information technology, while currently that figure is over 60 per cent. From about zero per cent to over 60 per cent in 50 years! A new educational paradigm is slowly and, with much resistance, working its way into fruition in the US. Of particular note in this new paradigm, most of the higher level positions, well-paying jobs, better placements and professional places are being taken by women. Males are becoming (actually, have become) an endangered species and don't think this does not constitute a threat to society What do hordes of testosterone-loaded young men with no prospects do The old jobs are largely gone, many left taken over by robots and the better and emerging jobs being taken by women. Here in T&T, do you wonder that crime (drugs and gangs) is a career default mode Do you have to wonder much for causes of increased violence against women Do you think it is going to get better before it gets worse As the old expression goes, \\\"you ain't seen nuthin' yet\\\". Let us take a look at some of the comparisons that Mr Baldeosingh made about the systems in other countries, especially, to make our points about revamping the total education system, in the way teachers are chosen and trained, and, most importantly, paid. Singapore is often compared to T&T with T&T usually cast in the negative light. Once you look into the differences in the make-up and complexities of the two societies, however, the comparison is not entirely fair. Anent the education system, in Singapore, teacher candidates are chosen from the upper one third of university graduates with even further screening of certain qualities amongst those. In Singapore, teachers are very highly valued and respected, they are very highly paid and they stay in their jobs. Is this true of T&T I think not. Consider the comparison with the US where teaching candidates come from the lower one third of university graduating classes, are not valued and respected, are poorly paid and do not stay in their jobs. One does not have to conjecture much to understand why the US now ranks so poorly on so many education parameters. Even though Singapore is considered to have one of the world's most successful educational systems, critics have pointed to shortcomings which the Singaporean government is starting to recognise and address. For all its shortcomings, America is able to produce world-class achievers as many (unfortunately far from all) US students are in a system where they are encouraged to develop the ability to reason, to think critically, to problem-solve ; basically to think, question, reject and synthesise. This is a far cry from the Singaporean emphasis on rote and strictly book learning. You receive what you are willing to pay for and what educational parameters you put into the system. Where do you place T&T in all this China is another country that in a relatively few years has produced an amazingly successful educational system which incorporates many attributes of the Singaporean system, However, like the Singaporeans, the Chinese are staring to recognise the same deficiencies. China is able to turn out thousands of engineers but not enough of the type with the ability to think to the next level, to make the innovations necessary to respond to the needs of a complex society. However, it is beyond the scope here to discuss the issues involved but suffice it to say that qualities found in many, but far from all, of the US systems, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and entrepreneurship, leave many advantages to these US systems which the Singaporeans, Chinese, Koreans and the Finns are now recognising and looking to address. Mr Baldeosingh discusses the Finnish system in particular, a system that has been widely recognised as highly successful. However, lessons from the Finland experience are not at all easy to reconcile with the historical experience and demographic diversity of T&T. The Finns start off with a dramatically different zeitgeist: they are a very old, settled, stable and most importantly, homogeneous society with a stable economy based upon agriculture (forestry products) and high tech (a company called Nokia). They also have a long (often negative) history with their neighbours to the East that yields a strong sense of solidarity in the Finnish population. Against this demographic and psychological background, re-creating an education system in a 30-year period as discussed by Mr Baldeosingh is impressive, but not totally remarkable. The Finns are, however, like everyone else, being challenged by the forces of modernity: immigration, changes in economic markets, an aging population. And the educational system is being challenged also! One significant educational issue that they now share with many other societies is what they call \\\"the lost boys\\\". The lost boys are those who aren't making it in the school system and are dropping out. The question in Finland as elsewhere is: \\\"Are dropouts failing in their studies, or is the system failing to support these individuals\\\" To be continued.

Gopeesingh, who commended the private sector involvement in the initiative, promised Government's support in continuing the study, saying he will consider any research work within the school system. \\\"We welcome this type of initiative because diseases like diabetes, which result from obesity, stems from a lack of physical activity in schools.This means that it must be an important component toward the final marks of the SEA,\\\" he said. \\\"Sports, debate and drama would be included in the curriculum and form a measurable part of the exams.\\\" Prof Surujpal Teelucksingh, a member of the DERPi board, said the \\\"worrying\\\" results showed that childhood diabetes in the country had tripled in the last ten years. \\\"That gives Trinidad and Tobago the gold medal in these statistics,\\\" he said.

One might wonder then why Theatre Arts teacher Ayanna Jordan would choose to teach at that school out of all the others in the country. To understand that you have to know Jordan. What might be a deterrent for some is a challenge waiting to be met and overcome by the former St Augustine Girls' High School pupil. \\\"I always wanted to teach at a school where there was a need for the arts,\\\" she told the Express. Those quick to focus on pupils she referred to as \\\"my children\\\" don't know the full story, Jordan said. \\\"The stories behind their actions are deep. I won't condone wrongdoing, but people don't understand.\\\" Jordan got into theatre arts at SAGHS when she played parts in The Odyssey, Pressure does buss pipe and her favourite, A Raisin in the Sun, under the direction of teachers Avril Ramchand and Ann Assing Ahyee. When Jordan left SAGHS, she pursued International Relations and Theatre Arts at The University of the West Indies. At the Centre for Festival Arts, UWI, she was awarded the Beryl McBernie Prize for being an allrounder. \\\"(Theatre practitioner) Rawle Gibbons used to say of my directing style that I have an attention for details and that I approach directing in a photographic way,\\\" Jordan said. Dani Lyndersay, senior lecturer and coordinator, Theatre Arts at the Centre for Festival Arts, recognised her love for community work.\\\" Jordan taught financial literacy at schools before moving to Mucurapo West Secondary four years ago. Starting up a theatre arts class at the school initially proved to be a challenge. Since there was no class allocated to Jordan, she first used the Physical Education room, which she had to share. She spent one year there before moving to her own classroom, which she furnished with platforms and mats using funds she raised at the school. Jordan sees her Second and Third Form pupils once every cycle (six days), her Fourth Form students three times a cyle and her Form Fives twice a cycle. Theatre Arts is a legitimate subject in the school cirriculum and students are tested on what they learn at the end of the term and at the CXC level. The petite teacher has observed that Theatre Arts has made a huge difference in the way youngsters relate to one another and how they deal with stress in their lives. \\\"One of the things that I have them do is to journal. This allows them to express their feelings,\\\" Jordan said. \\\"I stress to them that we are all family and that families pick up for one another, rather than pick on one another.\\\" Jordan also encourages her students to critique each other's performance so they all learn from each other. Without warning, and due to their rapport in the classroom, she has also become more than a teacher to her students; she's also their friend. \\\"They all have me on BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) and What's App\\u2014two cellphone chat programmes.\\\" Some of Jordan's pupils are also her Facebook friends. \\\"On Mother's Day I get a lot of greeting cards, which I welcome because I don't have children of my own.\\\" Last week Saturday, the Murcurapo West Secondary made its performance debut at J Errol Lewis and Renaissance Production's High Alert\\u2014State of Emergency at Queen's Hall, St Ann's. Jordan was a director of a piece on reformed prisioner and mentor Ashton Blandin, who at 17, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for fatally stabbling a school friend. After serving six years in jail, his case was called and he was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading gulty to a lesser count of manslaughter. This, on the grounds that he served six years prior to his sentencing and on the account that--through his mentorship--he helped his fellow Youth Training Centre inmates to change their lives. The experience at State of Emergency proved not just to be an entertaining evening out for the Mucurapo Theatre Arts students but one that allowed them to see in action what they learned in class. As expected, Jordan's drama team Otis Nisbit, Shane Jackson, Omari Mitchell (who played Ashton), Isha Khan, Sherkell Phillip, Andrea Williams, Afiya Thomas, Kyia Samaroo, Akillah Bengochea and Nicholas Derrick were all nervous, but the positive response from the audience proved to be a welcome reward for their hard work. \\\"Ashton's story really had a big impact on my students,\\\" Jordan said. \\\"I could tell that most of them identified with his story. \\\"When the production was over, they took turns talking about what they learned.\\\" Jordan believes that a teacher she has the responsibility to be a change agent. \\\"I take my job as a teacher seriously. I know I can't transform every student, but I think that when you love and respect children they would gravitate towards you and open up.\\\" A lot of breakthrough stories have come out of Jordan's Theatre Arts classes. Some of her teens have completely turned their lives around; her past students have also gone on to good jobs and often keep in touch with their \\\"miss\\\" to update her on post-school activities. Like a protective mother, Jordan takes personally the rebuke of her \\\"children\\\" and the pupils of Mucurapo West. \\\"To the people who talk bad about them I say if you didn't make an investment in these children, don't look for the returns.

This situation has stirred a placard protest by parents and pupils at the Sixth Company Anglican Primary School, with the secretary of the Anglican Education Board of Management bluntly telling the Express, \\\"We do not have teachers.\\\" At the Sixth Company school, one parent complained that a single teacher was obliged to teach two classes. The parents made clear their preference for one teacher to a class and, indeed, logistics alone makes this arrangement far from satisfactory. At other Anglican schools, principals, appointed to manage their institutions, were themselves having to teach classes. With the Anglican board looking to the Education Ministry to supply teachers, both sides appear to be blaming each other for bureaucratic foot-dragging. The ministry, claiming to provide \\\"qualified and competent applicants\\\", argues the board insists on having Anglican teachers, who may not be in adequate supply. If this is so, then the Anglican school board is being somewhat disingenuous. Additionally, the Anglican Church can hardly complain about a shortage of professionally qualified Anglicans to teach in its schools when, over the past 30 years, the proportion of the population identifying themselves as Anglican has fallen from 14 per cent to a mere five per cent. Even the Roman Catholic Church, which has the largest percentage of the population by religion, does not insist all the teachers in its schools be of the Catholic faith. If, however, the Education Ministry wanted to appoint qualified teachers on the basis of merit only, it would run afoul of the Concordat, which states: \\\"A teacher shall not be appointed to a school if the denominational board objects to such an appointment on moral or religious grounds.\\\" This means a qualified teacher can be rejected not only on the basis of being the wrong religion, but also because he or she is a divorcee, a non-believer, a homosexual, or whatever the denominational board classifies as morally or theologically objectionable. In this particular contretemps with the Anglican schools, if teachers satisfactory to the board and to the ministry cannot be found, the Concordat-based collaboration is clearly failing. If only for this reason, operation of the agreement needs to be revisited. This, however, will be no easy task. Even the suggestion of a revised Concordat, whether bruited by People's National Movement or United National Congress administrations, has always met with vehement opposition from all the religious bodies involved. That attitude must change if the nation's children, Anglican and others, are to have their universal right to an education.

I shall now address education in relation to those rights. In my article of July 23, I pointed out that in our present constitution and in the Working Document reference to education under human rights referred only to parents' rights. The Principles of Fairness draft constitution, however, proposed rights of the child and rights to education which could be linked. An important issue for education in this country is the legal age up to which education is compulsory (12 years). It should also be noted that the legal age for entry into the workforce is 16! Many persons, including myself, have pointed out this absurdity which can be corrected by a minor amendment to the Education Act. This law is to undergo major review but as with many important issues this will take many years. I have previously suggested that the legal age to which education should be compulsory should be raised to 18 to capture those youths who are now involved in gang activity. In any event the population is aging and the retirement age may have to be raised with the consequent raising of the age for entry into the work force. Already the revision of the Education Act is shrouded in mystery. Last year the Education Discussion Group (EDG) was invited by the Ministry of Education to submit proposals for revision of the Act. We were invited on two occasions to appear before the committee set up to review the Act to discuss our submissions. This year to our astonishment when we expected to receive a revised draft for comment we were sent a draft Education Act of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)! What this means I can only speculate. Does the Prime Minister's thrust for integration with the OECS mean that in future we will be following the lead of those countries While the Constitution can enshrine the right to education this cannot guarantee good quality in the education system or the essential social environment that will allow children to be given and benefit from an education system that allows them to express the potential for creativity that they all possess. Let us therefore examine the present circumstances in which children are placed to be educated. I shall start at primary school since the comprehensive system on early childhood centres is only now being installed and all praise to the Government for this effort. I shall first make general statements which are largely derived from discussion with teachers and persons concerned with the education system and then I shall attempt to back these up with such data as are available. There can be little doubt that the performance at the Secondary Entrance Assessment Examination (SEA) of students from different schools varies greatly. Since there will be random variation in the inherent abilities of any school population this variation in performance must be due to the social environment of the children, the environment of the school or the quality of the teaching. Let us first consider the physical environment of the school since this would be the easiest to verify. Primary schools vary from well designed and constructed and well maintained, to poorly designed, constructed and maintained. The frequent scenes on the television news of parents protesting on the poor condition of one school or another can leave no doubt as to the perilous state of many schools. But even where the schools are in relatively good repair the design may be unsuitable for learning. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Many situations are far from ideal but are accepted by many parents who have come to accept them once they can afford the extra lessons and their children can be crammed to get a relatively high mark in the SEA. Whether they are well educated or not becomes a secondary issue. At the recent symposium held by the EDG (in collaboration with the University of the West Indies and the University of Trinidad and Tobago) David Subran presented a comprehensive paper on \\\"Impact of school facilities on teaching and learning\\\". It is intended that this paper will be posted shortly on the EDG website (educationdiscussiongroup.com). A common feature of primary schools is a large space divided into classrooms by blackboards so that the teaching in one class can be heard in the adjacent class. It would be informative to correlate this feature with performance in the SEA. There have been two newspaper editorials recently that discuss the problems in the education system: \\\"Drastic overhaul of the education system needed\\\"Guardian, July 24 and \\\"Our classrooms need to be havens\\\" Express, July 24. Of particular importance are two articles in the Catholic news by Fr Martin Sirju (August 2 2\\\"Catholic primary education needs overhaul\\\" and August 9\\\"Education issues: part two: Lessons and elitist education\\\"). Fr Martin's second article also discusses the ethnic implications of the deficiencies in the system. I shall discuss these four articles in Part II of this series.

Their testimonials came during the visit of Gender, Youth and Child Development Minister Clifton de Coteau and other officials to the St Dominic's Children's Home and St Jude's School for Girls in Belmont. De Coteau outlined a number of plans by Government including the establishment of the National Children's Registry and the establishment of Transition Houses. Those measures are intended to improve the lives of about 972 children from five to 19, living in institutions. Originally from Point Fortin, Patrice Norton spoke to her audience of children and officials about her struggles to become an auditor. Her younger sister Adasha Norton has excelled in sports and wants to make the senior national netball team. Both young women were able to relate their success stories because of their stay at St Jude's School for Girls. They were born to a mother hooked on cocaine. Norton said: \\\"It (our mother's addiction) affected the quality of life. We lived in a shack. No toilet. No water. We were about five to six-years-old. Our mother would disappear for days. We would have to drink water for days to survive. Then she moved in with an old man. He taught us a thing or two about church. Our mother would visit us. She would be drugged out. She would act weird. She would say weird things.\\\" At one point, an elder sister and the police intervened. \\\"They would give us toys. But around September 1997, they decided they had to remove us from the depressing situation. We spent two days at a halfway house. I was 11. It was the first time I had a birthday party. I knew the situation was going to change,\\\" said Norton. Although their mother struggled with her cocaine addiction, Norton said she never forgot her mother would regretfully say: \\\"If I could, I would have listened to my mother. If I could have gotten an education, I would have had a better life.\\\" When they moved to St Jude's, and she started attending St Martin's High School, Diego Martin, she decided to pursue an education. Later, she pursued her A-Levels at Malick Secondary and then attended university. Norton said: \\\"Without St Jude's, it would not have been possible. The transition was difficult. There was no one to talk to me or understand my struggles. I tried to focus on my studies.\\\" Adasha Norton said: \\\"At seven, I made a wish on my birthday. I wanted to live in Port of Spain. Two years after, we made the transition. I was nine. But I could not count. I did not know the alphabet. At St Jude's I found out I could play tennis and netball. I went to St Vincent and Grenada. I even picked up hairdressing. Today I am an ambassador for St Jude's.\\\" Norton said: \\\"I don't know my father. We still care for our mother. She is still on cocaine. We do not look down upon her. We try to let her know how strong her children are.\\\" Evans Thomas, from St Dominic's Children's Home, did not know his father. His motivation came from his caregivers. \\\"When there is someone who can say I believe in you, when there is someone to hold on to, that was what kept me.\\\" Thomas urged the children to take advantage of all opportunities available. \\\"There are few people who understand the psychology of growing up in a home.

Photo by Roberto Codallo Hazel Browne. Photo by Roberto Codallo Carnival, we've long been told, is woman. But this year Carnival Tuesday crossed threads with the International Women's Day (IWD) commemoration. Coordinator of the Network of NGOs for the Advancement of Women, Hazel Brown, had no illusions about which March 8 celebration held the trump card. This year they've chosen to focus on the Commonwealth Day which is celebrated tomorrow (March 14). With the theme \\\"Women as agents for change\\\", the Network will honour women from various spheres. \\\"Some of these women work all day to ensure that there is food on their family's table. Others are campaigning for political, social & economic rights. Many are setting examples to others, pushing through vital reforms in the public service,\\\" Brown explained. Beyond our shores, however, women's organisations used IWD2011 as an advocacy platform in the area of education, training and decent work. Roberta Clarke, Regional Programme Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment explained that there must be a distinct interpretation of the theme in our region. \\\"There are countries where girls have very little access to primary education. That is not our norm so it does not have quite the same resonance. Post-independence our governments have made commitments to universal primary education. In most territories there is universal access to secondary education and there is tertiary access in three countries. Over the last 40 to 50 years Caribbean girls and women have taken this seriously. Sometimes the stats are quite stunning,\\\" Clarke acknowledges. \\\"Upwards of 70 percent of UWI entrants and graduates are women.\\\" But while many focus on girls' achievement, it remains true that too many girls and boys continue to under-achieve at the primary and secondary level. \\\"One of the issues we must address is the quality of the education we receive,\\\" Clarke pointed out. \\\"Many girls and boys leave school without certification or without adequate certification. The education sector generally is not achieving the kind of outputs we'd expect from the investments we're making. That's an agenda for women as well as men. In the Caribbean there are some countries where the majority of the workforce is unskilled. The global economy is geared toward skilled jobs and a value-added labour market.\\\" Clarke stressed that we must also address the role of education in socialising children, enhancing access to employment opportunities and fostering leadership among girls. \\\"We comprise most of the teachers and girls outstrip boys in academic performance, yet they do not hold down many top positions in the corporate world or in politics,\\\" Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bissessar acknowledged just over a year ago. There remains a gulf between women's academic attainment and their leadership in the world of work. \\\"The education sector is important for a number of reasons. Educators are the primary socialisers of children. They can dispense the value systems we want to promote or limit the stereotypes about how men and women and boys should behave. Very often those stereotypes are channeled through schools, family, and the popular media. Restrictive gender norms continue to be perpetuated by the education sector. It is important to change the culture,\\\" she said. Clarke stressed that the over-arching agenda should be creating innovative, reflective and critical individuals who can participate meaningfully in democracies. And that's an agenda that lasts year-round.

Teachers are entitled to 14 days casual leave (which may be taken during term time) and not 28 as I had stated. I apologise for the misstatement. I had in mind that the 14 days may be taken half day at a time and to take a half day from school is disruptive of the whole day's work especially if it is taken in the morning! I still maintain that the Government should negotiate with the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers' Association (TTUTA) to increase salaries and remove the casual leave. If a teacher has an urgent problem then arrangements should be made by the principal for the class to be supervised in some other way. It should be made illegal for a class in any school at any time to be without the supervision of a teacher since to do otherwise is to short change our children's learning and to place them in physical danger. I shall now discuss the other important issues raised in my last article: school and classroom design and numeracy and literacy. Announcements by the Minister of Education indicate that a number of new schools are to be built particularly to replace existing buildings that can no longer be repaired. Thus there is an opportunity to build schools that allow for modern teaching methods; have facilities for new subjects on the curriculum such as the performing arts; and which have lunchrooms. Some of the structures now used as Primary schools have to be seen to be believed. There are still some schools that consist of one long rectangular room with the \\\"class rooms\\\" separated only by chalkboards. The pupils at the end of one class hear the teacher from the adjacent class as well as the teacher from their own class. The Principal of a secondary school on seeing one such arrangement said to me: If you had attended that school you would not have achieved the educational level that you are at today. Even assuming that such schools are the exception how many schools are designed to further modern concepts of education Recently the Education Discussion Group (EDG), in collaboration with the University of the West Indies and the University of Trinidad and Tobago, held a symposium on school and classroom design. A summary report on this symposium is available from the EDG. The symposium was well attended by architects and educators, including officials from the Ministry of Education. A presentation by Mr Gary Turton of the Trinidad and Tobago Institute of Architects on \\\"Stimulating Learning Environments\\\" recommended for introductory reading an article in the journal Scientific American entitled: \\\"How room design affects your work and mood\\\". I retrieved this article through \\\"Google\\\" and again found this interesting reading. Not only the design but the colours in which the room is painted affects work performance. I wonder if such factors are considered in the building of our schools. The external environment (open spaces around the school) and the flow of student traffic into and within the school are also of importance. For example I understand that the Woodbrook Secondary school is to be rebuilt on the same site which is greatly congested. Another aspect of school design to which I call attention at every opportunity is the provision of lunchrooms. Very few of our schools have such facilities and arrangements for \\\"sit at table\\\" lunches. All the schools that I have visited in developed countries (or that I have seen in movies or documentaries) have such facilities and eating of lunches in lunch rooms is compulsory. Such arrangements help to teach discipline and etiquette which is now on the curriculum. Modern teaching methods demand suitable architectural arrangements. Government should arrange competitions with million dollar prizes (if we do this for our culture why can we not do it for the most important aspect of our social arrangements-education of our children) for school designs for pre-school, primary and secondary schools. I am convinced that one of the most important issues in our high crime rate is the fact that a significant number of our young males are leaving school being functionary illiterate. This situation leads to gang membership to achieve self-esteem since with such membership the ability to use a firearm is more important than being able to read and deal with any complexity of numbers. I was heartened recently to hear the Commissioner of Police stressing the importance of social factors in crime-fighting. Regrettably I did not hear him discuss schooling. I blame the present state of numeracy and literacy on a well intentioned decision in 2000 to place all children in secondary schools despite poor grades in what was then referred to as the 11-plus examination. Prior to that time such children went into post-primary classes in the primary schools where there was remedial teaching. When the decision was taken to place all children into secondary schools the post- primary classes should have been replaced by remedial classes in the secondary schools. This was not done and so a number of children go through secondary school not being able to read, write or deal with numbers. They are sent to the back of the class so as not to keep back the other pupils. So I place some of the blame for our present high crime rate on that decision. This problem will continue to exist until all primary schools attain high standards. Why do not our universities (we now have four operating at postgraduate level) research the social factors, including education, affecting crime to point the way to an effective long term solution to the crime problem There are many deficiencies in our education system and I have discussed only a few in these two articles. I selected these because they are not usually discussed in spite of the important role they play in our education system. John Spence is professor emeritus, UWI.

Sakeena Yacoobi founded the Afghan Institute of Learning (AIL) in 1995, providing schooling and healthcare in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan as well as setting up the secret home schools, which closed down when Taliban rule ended in 2001. Since then the charity has expanded its work, helping 12 million people, many of them girls, in rural and marginalised parts of Afghanistan, according to the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE). \\u201cIt is particularly meaningful because this is such a crucial time in Afghanistan,\\u201d said Yacoobi, accepting the prize in Doha, Qatar. \\u201cI dedicate the prize to the AIL and all of the women, men and children we are educating.\\u201d The Taliban have launched sustained attacks since the withdrawal of most foreign troops late last year, straining the limited resources of Afghan forces. Many districts across the country are now fully or partly under Taliban control. The US$500,000 education prize awarded by WISE, set up by the Qatar Foundation, recognises individuals or teams who successfully address global educational challenges that can bring real change to communities. US First Lady Michelle Obama also spoke at the conference. \\u201cWith this prize, we know that we can continue to educate more and more Afghans, giving them hope and encouraging them to go forward no matter what they are facing,\\u201d said Yacoobi. She has also opened private schools under her own name, set up a radio station, and plans to establish a university for women as well as a television network. Last year the prize was won by Ann Cotton, a British entrepreneur who set up Camfed, the Campaign for Female Education, which has helped educate more than one million girls in Africa. Other past winners include Vicky Colbert, a Colombian, Madhav Chavan, an Indian, and Fazle Hasan Abed, from Bangladesh. (Reporting By Joseph D'Urso, editing by Tim Pearce.

My main worry, however, is that the technocrats at the Ministry of Education might not know, either. In considering single-sex schools as a policy which might help improve learning, the Ministry has adopted the right approach: a pilot project. But all the critics have been speaking as though this project is already a policy that will, eventually, be implemented in all schools. On the basis of mistrust of Government, such a reaction is understandable. Too frequently in this regime's tenure, policies have been foisted on the country without consultation and even, as the Prime Minister boasted about his tall buildings, without planning. But, rather than criticising the project itself, which is already underway, it might be more productive if the stakeholders, such as TTUTA and the National Parents Teachers Association and others, ensured that the project is done as a proper experiment. Single-sex initiatives in other countries haven't been conducted with enough rigour so we can state, with reasonable certainty, that this policy improves educational outcomes for boys and girls. Nonetheless, it is a scientific fact that male and female brains function differently, and that these differences are innate rather than, as humanities scholars like to suggest, socialised. This would logically mean that boys and girls require different teaching methods in order to learn effectively. However, human behaviour is too complex for even logical assumptions, so an experiment is the best way to reach a conclusion. Thus we have 20 schools converted from co-educational to single-sex, starting with the incoming cohort. The idea, presumably, is to benchmark the Forms Four and Five, which are still mixed, and then compare their academic performance and socialisation to the Form Ones, who are now single-sex. So the experiment is a five-year one. If this is so, it would mean that baseline data have already been collected on students in all 20 schools. If that is the case, this data should be provided to researchers at UWI, since it must be useful for analyses beyond single-sex schooling. And, if journalists request the baseline overview academic performance, socioeconomic profile, ethnic breakdown, behavioural indicators, and so on it will be readily available. And if the Ministry has measured staff ratios, equipment supplies, infrastructural quality, and so on, these will be kept constant over the five-year period, since any change in these variables would confound the factor they're trying to test: single-sex classes. And, yes, I wrote this paragraph on the basis that \\\"if\\\" is the biggest small word in the English language. Anyway, these are the criteria which are needed for a proper pilot project, although it would still be a more effective experiment if a single-sex high performing government school, such as St Francois Girls College, was converted to co-education, so as to provide a control. But I won't quibble too much, because experiments of any sort are very rare in education, and not just in Trinidad and Tobago. You would think, given the importance everyone places on education, it would be the leading area for research in the social sciences. In fact, the opposite is true. The Express used to carry a regular column by various lecturers from UWI's School of Education, and I guarantee that 99 per cent of the pedagogy in those articles was not based on any scientific research. Instead, there are whole bodies of \\\"theory\\\" dreamed up by various academics, which has never been subject to any testing to see if they actually work in the classroom. Thus, in the teaching courses at UWI and the University of Trinidad and Tobago, the ideas of Jean Piaget, John Dewey, Lawrence Kohlberg, Jerome Bruner, and even BF Skinner are promulgated as if they are correct. These scholars offered certain theories about how children's minds work, which have led to pedagogical practices such as look-say reading and socialisation through authority. However, research by cognitive and child psychologists has proven that the intellectual and moral developmental stages identified by Piaget and Kohlberg, as well as the models of learning created by Dewey and Bruner, are flawed. This means that teaching techniques built on these ideas start from wrong premises. Siegfried Engelmann, inventor of the Direct Instruction teaching method, in his book War Against the Schools' Academic Child Abuse describes education research as follows: \\\"They conduct a study in which nothing is taught. Instead, they 'study' something about the kids' behaviour. They then suggest teaching techniques based on what the kids do. This kind of 'study' gives no indication of what caused the kids' behaviour in the first place.\\\" Yet it is these theories which are more accurately described as philosophies or even ideologies which inform education policy in many countries. Let's hope the Education Ministry is not mimicking this approach. kbaldeosingh@hotmail.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

It may therefore be appropriate to pay attention to educational issues in the United Kingdom as these may contain important lessons for us. Over the recent past the UK has expanded university education by the creation of a large number of new universities. At the same time there seems to have been very significant grade inflation among A-level students. In last year's exams, 27 per cent of all A-levels taken resulted in a grade A and 95 per cent of students passed at least two A-Levels. Thirty two per cent of those from private schools receive three grade A passes which was higher than the 11 per cent from state schools who received three A grades. There is much debate as to whether the high percentage of passes and \\\"A'' grades has resulted from a reduction in the difficulty of exams or simply because children are better prepared. Whatever the reason the number of students attending university has increased (now 45 per cent of all school leavers go to university) and it is becoming more difficult for the universities to differentiate between the excellent students and the merely average students. One consequence has been the introduction of an A grade to help identify the best students. The most significant development, however, has been the consequence of the unsustainable budget deficit on the financing of tertiary education. For many years UK students have been heavily subsidised in their tertiary education. The maximum charge to local students for fees was approximately TT$32,900 per annum. The state then pays the university directly a further TT$80,000 subsidy for tuition. By contrast, overseas students are charged the full cost which averages approximately TT$140,000 per annum (fees vary according to the course and university). In some respects therefore the overseas students help finance the deficit at the universities by paying more than local students even after consideration of the government subsidy. The UK government recently announced that the subsidies would be cut very significantly. Students will now be expected to pay TT$90,000, almost triple what they paid in prior periods. There is also a further debate about alternative funding through scholarships and student loans. As a direct result of this revised policy there were large student demonstrations in London, some of which became violent. Readers may recall that Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla were subjected to an attack in which a window of their car was broken. This very un-British behaviour has resulted from the strong feelings arising from some significant hardship for existing students. Clearly the tertiary education system is now under pressure because its cost has become unsustainable. Not only can the UK no longer afford the existing subsidies but there also appears to be a shortage of jobs for the new graduates. It is possible the massive increase in fees will result in a declining demand for university places among local students. The universities may turn to overseas students to expand their intake to survive the revenue cuts. The important lesson, I believe, is to understand the importance of planned sustainable development in tertiary education that will not require any sudden cutbacks and is supported by effective demand rather than government subsidy. Most would agree that education is the fundamental building block for the development of society and should avoid any unexpected contraction. In recent years in Trinidad and Tobago we also have engaged in a very significant expansion of tertiary education through UWI, the new University of Trinidad and Tobago, expanded scholarships, COSTAATT and GATE funded private colleges. It is very important that this expansion maintains the existing standards of education. There are risks that some university entrants may not be fully prepared for tertiary education and the standards fall as a result. There is also the risk of \\\"grade inflation'' if the quality is not maintained. There is the further risk that the education provided may not match the employment needs of society, which means there will be no suitable jobs for the new graduates. And there is the further risk that if we expand subsidies too swiftly the costs will become unsustainable and lead to unplanned cutbacks. Subsidies should be carefully aimed towards the focused needs of society and balanced with the ability of those graduating from secondary schools. There is little point providing university places that cannot be filled with the appropriate quality of student, nor is there any point offering scholarships for PhDs in obscure subjects where we do not have a demand for these PhDs. It is also important that primary and secondary education provide students of appropriate quality to fill the expanded tertiary education places. In a developing country the sustainability and quality of education are of paramount importance. It is to be hoped that this development will be part of a well balanced plan and we can learn to avoid the mistakes which have become apparent in the UK.

There is a brown girl in the ring, tra la la la laDoes skin colour affect how you view yourself and your peers Come back now to the present day and ask yourself how do your children see themselves in a multiracial and cosmopolitan society As parents do we discuss racial identities and attitudes with our children Kerry-Ann Escayg, a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology and Equity Studies at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, asks and answers this question and more through her research topic: The role of parents and teachers in pre-school -Trinidadian childrens racial identities and attitudes. Salient findings from pioneering studies on race and young children, such as those by Clark and Clark (1939), suggest that between the ages of three and five, children become increasingly aware of their racial identities and develop both positive and negative attitudes toward racial groups, including their own. Contemporary research (2001; Gopaul-McNichol, 1995) also confirms that black children continue to display racial preferences toward white/light skin tones, states Escayg who is also an Ontario certified Kindergarten-Grade 6, teacher. She further argues- Very little attention has been paid to the process of racialisation of Caribbean children; more specifically, how parents and teachers influence childrens construction and application of racial knowledge. My study addresses these gaps using an anti-colonial and anti-racism lens to deconstruct the nuanced understandings of race in the Trinidadian context, and its transmission to pre-school children. Escayg, a graduate of St Francois Girls' College, Belmont, has published scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals on the topics of equity, race and teacher diversity. Her most recent contribution is a co-authored chapter on Afrocentric teaching in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education-\\\"Inquiry into Practice: Reaching Every Student Through Inclusive Curriculum. Formerly a resident of Chaguanas, she also has an extensive list of presentations at peer-reviewed scholarly meetings, including this year's presentation on \\\"Children and Race in the Caribbean Diaspora\\\" at the annual Caribbean Studies Association Conference. Concomitant to her active involvement in and commitment to anti-racism scholarship and practice, she was recently invited to serve as a guest panelist at York Universitys Race Seminar Speaker Series, and to participate in the Centre for Integrative Anti-Racism Studies at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, Speaker Series, on race and racism beyond the Canadian social context. Her repertoire of elite qualifications and major strides in the academic world at age 28 may be mind-boggling to many, but a peek into the findings of her research is even more amazing. Her preliminary findings suggest that not only are pre-school Trinidadian children aware of racial differences, such as skin colour and hair texture, they also accord positive characteristics to two racial groups-East Indian and mixed. \\\"The former is considered as being smart, and the latter as being more physically attractive, Escayg said While it is quite evident that children at this age have not fully developed an understanding of racial group membership/categories (for example, Indian, negro, mixed, white), they did demonstrate an ability to isolate phenetoypical characteristics, such as skin colour, as a prominent signifier of difference, says Escayg. According to Escayg, the participants in her study were Indo-Trinidadian, Afro-Trinidadian, and children of mixed race. A compelling phenomenon which was revealed in the racial identity interview session was that the mixed children and Afro-Trinidadian children, accurately identified with their racial background, whereas the Indian children (female participants) identified with white and mixed children. Equally relevant was the fact that the majority of parents in the study indicated that while they believe it was important to discuss race with their child, they were unsure as to whether this discussion should begin at the pre-school age. Some participants also mentioned that if they were to discuss race with their child, it may solidify, and not challenge, their misconceptions. When asked how they will cultivate a positive racial identity in their child, only a few parents felt confident in their ability to do so. In fact, one parent (Afro-Trinidadian) responded to this question by proudly declaring: I will tell her,..you see this traffic light, a black man created it, the elevatorwe made that too, declared Esacgy who incidently is also a recipient of the Gordon Cressy Student Leadership Award. Another interesting revelation from interviews conducted was that teachers confessed to experiences with children using racial slurs, and displaying preference for children of lighter skin tones, and softer hair texture but due to limited exposure to anti-racism training, which engenders more inclusive and anti-racism classroom spaces, they couldnt effectively manage the situation. I believe that in order to move towards an early childhood education that is empowering and inclusive, we must first acknowledge how young children are affected by the social structure, particularly in relation to the construction and application of their racial knowledge; and subvert these with teaching practices that do not reinforce or reproduce a hierarchy of identities, knowledges and lived experiences, suggests Escayg. Another caveat pertinent to the discourse is the difference in which racial groups perceive race relations in Trinidad. When quizzed, Afro-Trinidadian and mixed parents affirmed that there is still a race issue in Trinidad, and even provided personal examples to illustrate. The views of East Indian participants however, were varied, and somewhat less personal, she explained.. Escayg said that on closer analysis, the microscope was placed on the local education system- Why is the process of racialisation different for African-Trinidadian, mixed and Indian children Why is there such a reticence to discuss race with children, even though parents are aware that there are still racial divisions and spurious racial ideologies that marginalise children from particular racial groups And finally, how is the education system responding to promoting positive racial identities in children across the various age levels Much of the findings are consistent with previous literature on young children and race, particularly in relation to preference of lighter skin tones and (softer) hair texture. A point of departure in my work however, is the centrality of both environmental (parents and teachers) and systemic factors. I contend that if we are to disabuse our childrens minds of such inimical racial ideologies, then the pre-school period is indeed the incipient stage of this revolutionary process. It is a stage where we can begin to unravel the multiple layers of false consciousness, which is too often reproduced and reworked to their own detriment, avows the anti-colonial scholar. A born-again Christian, she believes her firm faith in God has inspired her work and that her findings will contribute to the fabric of a more stable society. To conclude, Escayg makes it clear that her mission is sincere as she cites her goals Once sponsors for a venue and time permit, I would like to offer free seminars for parents, teachers and the general public on the topic of children and race. It is time we work to decolonise our minds, and our children's minds, if we are to transgress the current social order. We owe it to our nations children. They are all worth the effort.

A woman with a strong will, and a zest for education that was developed during her childhood. It is the combination of these two qualities that have enabled Rochford to rise above her humble beginnings and attain her present status of educator and author. But what is most striking about Rochford is the fact that, in spite of her now many major accomplishments, she has not forgotten where she has come from and does her best to impart her strong determination and fervour for education unto others, mainly her students. Rochford was born in a place called Caigual, a place all the way behind Gods back as the common parlance goes here. And that is not just my perspective on her home village. I was born in a little village outside of Sangre Grande called Caigual. The only one who might know that village is the local writer, Anthony Michael, quipped Rochford. But while her early childhood was spent in Caigual, the balance of her youth was lived out in Diego Martin, where her parents moved there with her, and her six siblings. So when Diego Martin Junior Secondary was established in 1972, Rochford became a pupil there. I am a junior secondary product, a good product, she noted. But it is questionable that Rochford would have been a good product without the encouragement and support of both her parents. My parents didnt go to secondary school. They had seven kids, all of them, save for one, went to university. There is even one doctor in the family. My parents were sticklers for education. My mother would be cooking and shed have us around the table doing work. We got our books as soon as school went on break. Shed have us reading until school re-opened. Rochford, therefore, learned very early the value and importance of education. It is no surprise, therefore, that Rochford has found herself smack dab in the academic arena doing her best to impart the value of learning onto her pupils, in the same way that her parents have imparted the value of learning onto her. She had started off as an ECCE teacher and from there, moved on to preparatory school and then on to primary school. Maraval Primary School was my only primary school, she stated. Jehue Gordon is my claim to fame at the primary school level. Moreover, that Rochford was doing a good job imparting her love of learning onto her students became evident at Maraval Primary, where she had nine pupils, including Jehue, pass for Belmont Secondary School and a few others for St Francois Girls College. She taught the SEA class. In 2006, after teaching for sometime at St Anthonys College, she ended up at Bishops Anstey High School, Port-of-Spain, as a Communication Studies teacher. And in 2012, she made waves in the academic world when, in her class of 28 pupils, all 28 received one's with 21 distinctions in the CAPE May/June 2012 exam in Communication Studies. I kept telling them that I am going to be there for you. We are a class with a vision on a mission to succeed. I love to motivate my studentsOn the day of the exam, I meet my girls and I tell them, hear my voice telling you what a medium is I love to put things on my walls to motivate them. I give them love notes, Rochford stated as she explained the techniques she utilises in her classrooms to help her pupils succeed. Love notes are little letters containing positive and edifying statements to help her pupils stay on track. I should add here that the aforementioned class was considered an underperforming class given that they were the C classes (classes are divided alphabetically at Bishops Anstey High: A, B and C, with C being the least advanced students) and was comprised of mainly science students (at least when they had moved into Lower 6; also, those in the academic world, English and Literature teachers to be exact, know that Science and Math students tend not to write very well and so pose a challenge to their language teachers). But Rochford is a good motivator. Her 2012 class would have also benefitted from the fact that Rochford is a table leader at CXC. Such a position allows her to talk to other teachers in the field and see what students are writing. She is also able to see what CXC and CAPE expect from students. Her present classes also enjoy that benefit. Rochford is now at Holy Faith Convent where she teaches both Communication Studies and Caribbean Studies. However Because of a recent move to Couva, she has transferred there. She confessed that her pupils at Bishop Anstey High miss her. Nonetheless, she maintains contact with them. I have no childrenAll my students are my children, she told me. Indeed, she treats them as such. Rochford is the author of Communication Studies: Preparing Students for Cape. She is married to Phillip Rochford, whom she describes as her motivational coach. He, too, is involved with her classes. akholder22@aol.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

In a study conducted in 2007 among 32 primary and secondary schools, Williams noted that 26.6 per cent of males reported being bullied while more than seven per cent of females said they were victims of physical bullying. Although there are no current statistics to indicate the prevalence of bullying in schools today, Williams told the Express that news reports and anecdotal evidence suggest that the issue of bullying has rapidly worsened. At a workshop held last Thursday afternoon at the Department of Social Sciences addressing the issue of bullying, domestic violence and rape, Williams spoke at length about bullying in the workplace and at school. Victims of bullying suffer with negative feelings, low self esteem and may resort to suicide or murder. Williams noted that there are not enough safeguards in schools to protect children against bullies and emphasised the role the Ministry of Education plays in curbing the problem. \\\"Educators need to recognise the potential for bullyingas soon as it is identified the next step is dealing with it. All educators must also be sensitised and each school must have specialised counselors to deal with this issue. There also must be ramifications if teachers knowingly turn a blind eye to bullying,\\\" said Williams. Legislation to fight bullying must be put in place, noted Williams. Standard policies and procedures to deal with the problem, stringent punishment for those engaging in bullying and mandatory training for teachers along with specialised counsellors in schools is necessary to combat the growing problem. Guest speaker Diana Mahabir-Wyatt later told the media that legislation to deal with bullying is needed. \\\"You have to be very clear to define what bullying is and not only bullying of children with other children, but bullying of teachers to children and bullying of people within the school system to children because it's an extremely complex subject and once you have defined what bullying is and say it's against the law, then you've got to develop appropriate measures to deal with it,\\\" said Mahabir-Wyatt. She added, \\\"It's going to be very, very difficult, but if we are going to deal with the violence in society, we've got to start with schools.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

He states that some 2,000 pupils obtained below 30 per cent in that examination. The news media continue to rave over the performance at the top end (pupils obtaining over 95 per cent); as a society our concern must be for the 2,000 pupils whom the system has failed. I would be interested to know how many pupils would be expected to get below 30 per cent if they all had the environment (parenting, schooling, level of income and so on) that those above 95 per cent had. In order to judge just how well or badly our pupils are performing at both ends of the scale one would need to know a lot more about the system of examination. For example, I am surprised that over 150 candidates would get over 95 per cent in an examination (other than one in mathematics alone). In the United Kingdom there is concern of the standards in the Advanced Level examination and there is talk of \\\"dumbing down\\\"lowering of the standards. What does scoring over 95 per cent or below 30 per cent in the SEA mean How many of the pupils who score below 30 per cent can neither read nor write What percentage of those pupils writing the examination obtained between 50 per cent and 40 per cent, 40 per cent and 30 per cent and so on down to between 10 per cent and 0 per cent It would be interesting to compare the SEA results with those of the National Test since I believe these latter carry international standards. The fact is that to be able to pinpoint the problem one may need to undertake a great deal of research; the Ministry of Education does not have the resources or the environment to conduct such research and so the universities must be funded to undertake this vital task. As an aside, the appointment of Ms St Rose-Greaves in the Prime Minister's office as Advocate for children is of extreme importance. It is my hope that she will be able to lobby successfully to have some of these problems researched. I must express my surprise and disappointment that a commentator in last Sunday's Express newspaper criticised the appointment of Ms St Rose-Greaves, apparently on the grounds that contract appointments in general were open to abuse. In my article in the Express of June 3, I had suggested the appointment of Ms St Rose-Greaves in the Prime Minister's office where she would be in a position to hasten the establishment of a permanent Advocate for Children and the Children's Authority which I am confident she will do. I shall now discuss some issues with tertiary education. In my article in the Express of July 1, I had suggested that consideration should be given for tertiary education to be reunited with the Ministry of Education as is the case in many countries and had been the case in this country until the creation of a Ministry of Science, Technology and Tertiary Education. Does the present arrangement imply that tertiary education is only about science and technology However, perhaps the problems with primary and secondary education should be dealt with successfully before tertiary education is rejoined with them. In my Express article of June 11 I wrote: \\\"What is urgently needed is a body to oversee UWI and UTT and a university council should be created such as exists in Jamaica.\\\" I have since discovered that the University Council of Jamaica is in reality an accreditation council similar to the Accreditation Council that already exists in this country. I have also discovered that in this country there is a Green Paper on the website of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Tertiary Education dated October 2009 but with a foreword signed by the new Minister, Senator Fazal Karim. This Green Paper is entitled: \\\"Policy on Tertiary Education, Technical-Vocational Education and Training, and Lifelong Learning in Trinidad and Tobago\\\". There are some curious aspects to this development. Evidently this Green Paper has been adopted wholesale by the new Government, including the 2020 vision which the Paper uses as its starting point. In view of this I must register my disagreement, as I have done on many occasions during the time of the last PNM government, to the people of this country having as an objective that they shall be \\\"fun loving\\\". While pleasure and happiness are important aspects of our well being to have \\\"fun loving\\\" as an objective in an important statement on our aims and objectives for development in my view sends the wrong message to our young people. This Green Paper also proposes some developments that I have not seen in the People's Partnership Manifesto. The Green Paper states: \\\"It is envisioned that the governance of the system will be facilitated by a single National Education Commission comprising separate but interlinked Councils to deal with all levels of education including TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)\\\". The Councils to be created are: Council for Tertiary Education and Training; Technical-Vocational Education and Training Council; and a National Council of Science, Technology and Innovation. The People's Partnership Manifesto proposes under Tertiary Education that: \\\"A National Commission for Higher Education will guide the sector and we will work with Caricom and other governments of the region, as well as the Association of Tertiary Institutions to establish a Regional Qualifications Framework and to strengthen quality in a diverse system across the world.\\\" This is quite a different concept from that proposed in the Green Paper and if all of these proposals were to be adopted there would be \\\"overload\\\" in the system! The Green Paper was prepared apparently for the previous government by technocrats who no doubt did an excellent job. However, when will political parties develop their own policies based on their political philosophy which could be discussed subsequently by technocrats It might have been wiser for the People's Partnership Government to tread more slowly and to develop and articulate its own philosophy and programme for the governance of the education system. I have been invited to a consultation on the Green Paper and so shall reserve further comment until after those discussions. Prof John Spence is a retired UWI lecturer.

For while we celebrate those who have \\u201cdone well\\u201d there are many who receive the outcome as anything but a cause clbre. And we can expect the same when the CXC results are released. Universal education should mean that students no longer have to compete for school places since there is adequate provision for all children at all levels. It is now possible to have seamless transitions from ECCE through to secondary level. Why then do we persist with the unnecessary anxiety-producing SEA exam Universal access to schooling is based on the principles of equity and social justice. Thus we are challenged to revisit policies and practices to ensure that they are equitable and just. It means therefore, that those policies and practices that have entrenched inequality and sustained inequity in our education system must go. The SEA exam is one such practice. Why the SEA continues to be part of the educational landscape Perhaps it is the easier option for the principal stakeholders, namely the Government, the schools and the parents! They know that it is not just a matter of waving a magic wand. Doing away with the exam means that we have to find new ways to manage the transition to secondary school. Removal of the SEA should involve deliberations on the broader issues of the effectiveness of schooling and of the inefficiencies and wastage in the system. This is not beyond our capability; neither do we need another multi-million dollar World Bank or IDB project. The removal of the SEA exam presents us with a unique opportunity to engage in a comprehensive re-culturing of the education system. This must include rethinking and restructuring some of the organisational aspects of the school system. It also requires that we anticipate changes in policies and practices. The aim should be to remove inefficiencies and improve the quality of schooling so as to graduate confident persons who are socially and intellectually competent. The re-culturing process should require all schools to improve the quality of their programmes and the quality of their graduates. Schools however, must be provided with the required support and resources for achieving these goals. Several aspects of schooling directly affect the quality of student outcomes: teachers and the quality of their teaching; school leadership; the level of funding and resourcing to support teaching and learning; and the collaborative support of the home and community. In restructuring the system, we should seek to eliminate differences among schools. Schools at all levels should be well resourced and staffed with high quality teachers and administrators. All schools should be standardised on key factors. Standards are needed for the following: staffing of schools and related administrative functions; funding, equipment, resource materials, and support facilities; buildings and infrastructure; leadership and administration; and teacher, student, and school, performance. Policies should also incorporate accountability measures. Once teacher performance standards are defined and teachers are given adequate support for meeting those standards, teachers should be held accountable for their students' achievements, but within reason, since many factors that affect learning are beyond teacher or school control. Individual schools must be held accountable for the quality of their graduates. Schools should establish proper outreach programmes to build partnerships with parents and communities. The Ministry of Education and its agents should be held accountable for the general outcomes of schools, their quality, physical infrastructure, and resourcing. Most crucial is the need to bring teaching in Trinidad and Tobago into the 21st century. The Ministry of education, because of its public service identity, is increasingly incapable of managing the teaching profession, particularly with regard to the issue of quality assurance. It is unreasonable to expect principals and teachers to behave like professionals while teaching is administered like a public service occupation. The teaching profession must be placed in the hands of the professionals, as is done in other professions; in highly successful education systems; and as directed by the Caricom education ministers. The money that is spent on the SEA examination would be better spent on establishing and monitoring standards, resourcing schools adequately, providing teachers with adequate compensation and working conditions; and timely maintenance and repair of equipment and buildings. Most prudent, however, would be channelling this money into a programme for teachers' and administrators' continuing professional development so as to motivate and encourage them to strive for and maintain excellence. This is the ultimate challenge of Universal Education: to have high quality teachers in all classrooms and high quality administrators in all schools so that all children can benefit optimally from their schooling.

The governing bodies of these schools would continue to be responsible for the administration, maintenance, repair and furnishing of the schools. These schools will continue to qualify for government aid and the principals would make available a minimum of 80 per cent of places for government allocation. The principals would be free to allocate 20 per cent of the remaining places, as they see fit, all these students to be taken from those \\\"passing the test\\\". Thus the Government is responsible for selecting only 80 per cent of pupils allocated to individual schools. There is reference in this Clause to students \\\"passing the test\\\" but this is no longer relevant as secondary school places are now provided for all. The Concordat does not prevent government from using any method for allocating students to schools. The system of admission now used is by order of merit in the \\\"test\\\" (Secondary Education Assessment SEA) modified by parents' choice. I have written a series of five articles in the Express (December 2005 to January 2006 ) entitled \\\"Education and social equity\\\" in which I suggested that this system is unfair to persons of low income, perpetuates class divisions and mitigates against social mobility of children of lower income groups. Some of our primary schools are substandard, badly designed and are in a state of disrepair. Many teachers at primary school level will continue to have inadequate qualifications until the policy of recruiting only teachers with university qualifications has been in effect for many years and all under-qualified teachers have retired. Parents who have the financial and other resources are able either to use private (fee-paying) primary schools or are able to make up for deficiencies in the school system by the home environment, paying for extra lessons and so on. I now discuss the remaining clauses. Clause Six deals with removal of pupils from school (for disciplinary reasons or unsatisfactory progress); the principal may suspend a pupil pending an investigation but the authority to expel a pupil is vested solely in the Cabinet. It is not stated who shall carry out the investigation but presumably this is to be conducted by the Ministry of Education. Clause 7 states \\\"All new Central schools may be established only by Government for the simple reason that these schools are to be fed from the primary schools of all denominations, as well as Government Schools which may be in the area served by the central school. Where, however, the need arises for converting an existing denominational school into a secondary school, the denominational character of the school will be allowed to remain.\\\" This clause has been used by the Government to prohibit denominations from building any new schools except with State permission. Clause 8 states: \\\"The selection of teachers for training at the Teachers' College is to remain solely with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Selection of teachers for training in the existing denominational training colleges (as far as I am aware these no longer exist) may be made by the denominational boards: but such selection must be approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture.\\\" Such training was often carried out after the teacher had joined the teaching service (in-service training). The Teachers' colleges are now a part of the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) which offers a degree in Education. The policy now to be pursued by the Government (which I fully support) is for all teachers to undergo pre-service training. UWI at St Augustine, after many years of offering only an in-service training post-graduate diploma in Education is now launching a pre-service programme. Clause 9 states that training of teachers should be at the Teachers' College under government supervision. The denominational training colleges existing at that time were to continue in existence but not to be expanded. Government-operated teacher training colleges are being transferred to UTT. Teacher education will thus now be offered at three universities UWI, UTT and the University of the Southern Caribbean. In the 51 years since the Concordat was agreed to, there have been major changes in the education system and some of the provisions are no longer relevant. Further the way in which the system has developed has resulted in a streaming of better performing primary school students into so-called prestige schools, mainly denominational, based on an academic examination (SEA) in which pupils from low income families are at a distinct disadvantage. The result is that instead of the religious denominations helping the disadvantaged in society they are catering in the main for the pupils of families who can afford a better primary school preparation for the SEA. The main basis of our judgment that denominational schools perform better is the number of scholarships won by the school which may not reflect the \\\"value added\\\" (the performance of pupils at \\\"O\\\" level or CXC in relation to their performance at SEA) to the majority of students in the school. We must ensure that Government schools are brought up to the best level. In the meanwhile to move towards greater social equity, the denominational schools should be allocated at least 50 per cent of candidates from the lower end of the SEA pass list and such students must be given special attention. I am basing this proposal on the fact that religious denominations are concerned with the good of society as a whole and in particular with helping the disadvantaged and so I would expect this proposal to have full support of the denominations.

Oh, the shame of it. The University is Mount St Vincent (UMSV). This is the second contract given to this university and I shall quote from an article I wrote in the Express, April 10, 2003: \\\"The contract to develop the curriculum for technology studies has been given to an obscure Canadian university (Mount St Vincent University). This university is listed as number 40 in an assessment of 60 Canadian universities and its web-site indicates that it does not have any faculties dealing with technology. There are no faculties of engineering or agriculture and the science programme does not appear to offer degrees in chemistry or physics. Yet Mount St Vincent was favoured over UWI for the award of the contract to develop the curriculum for technology education in this country! Surely such a syllabus needs to be developed indigenously rather than by foreigners from an alien environment. Using a foreign university will ensure that the materials needed by the schools to teach the subject will have to be imported.'' \\\"Mt St Vincent University has also been given the contract for the training of the teachers in technology education. This should be closely monitored.\\\" \\\"The recommendations of the Ministry of Education to the Central Tenders Board for the award of this contract comparing UWI and Mt St Vincent need to be fully exposed.\\\" \\\"Ironically UWI has done important work in the Caribbean in technology education and has produced extensive curriculum material in this subject that is being adopted by Caricom countries-except Trinidad and Tobago! In any event we should take every opportunity to build up our tertiary-level institutions by involving them in activities of this kind (even if this means foregoing loans from multinational agencies)\\\". I shall give two examples taken from the technology syllabus document which is the revised draft of the Secondary School curriculumForm 2technology education. The document states that \\\"Dr Robert Sargeant, international consultant, guided the curriculum design and development process. The examples given below are extracted from the biotechnology section of the technology syllabus. Example 1: Sensitisation of students to genetic engineering in plants and small livestock. Year II Term II 2. Design a procedure for gene manipulation e.g., budding in roses, mating in rabbits. I am certain that my readers will know that budding in plants does not in any way involve manipulation of genes or any form of genetic engineering. Example 2: Course outline Biotechnology Year I Term ISuggested activity-micro organisms- 2. Perform technological process (fermentation) to convert raw material (fruit, sugar, flour, yeast) or (other) resources into useful products: wine, bread, vaccines and antibiotics. Production of vaccines in schools By fermentation Dr Robert Sargeant is the lead consultant in the two new contracts to be undertaken by UMSV. At the time of the publication of this draft a colleague and I were interviewed by the then minister of education and we brought the errors in the syllabus to her attention. The minister, I believe, referred the document to the University of the West Indies but I never heard if any corrections were made. Since the present loan, I am informed, is from the Inter-American Development Bank the item must be advertised internationally. Was it advertised locally If we can build a $7 billion highway without borrowing from IADB why can we not do the same for the few millions needed for the education contract It is vital that a school syllabus be developed in relation to local mores. This is particularly important at the primary school level. Otherwise we could go wrong in the education of our children for generations to come. Last year (2012) UMSV was ranked by Macleans in the category of universities that are mainly undergraduate, as number 17 out of 19 Canadian universities. There are two important reports available on the secondary school curricula produced by the previous studies. One was prepared by Prof D Poonwassie of Manitoba University (now retired) a Trinidadian with a distinguished career in Canada, and W Anderson. Prof Poonwassie has recently been honoured by this Government by being one of five Trinidadians who were awarded the Distinguished National of Trinidad and Tobago Canada Award. In a report on these awards (Express October 15, 2012 by Carolyn Kissoon) it stated: \\\"Poonwassie, professor emeritus, University of Manitoba, is the founding director of two groundbreaking programmes focusing on Aboriginal students. Both projects received National Awards from the Canadian Association for Continuing Education\\\". The second report was prepared by Dr Edrick Gift who has had a distinguished career in education in T&T having served on the staff of the School of Education at UWI St Augustine and a lecturer at a teachers' training college. Both of these reports are of extreme importance but seem to have been down played. I shall quote from one of the conclusions of the Gift report (on the Secondary Education Modernisation Programme (SEMP), Curricula in Technology Education, Science and Social Studies) which goes to the heart of the issue: \\\"The three curricula did not draw sufficiently from the culture, environment, and realities of Trinidad and Tobago.\\\" How do we correct this situation Presumably we cannot get out of the contract with UMSV. Government will have to commission UWI to conduct a parallel study to produce the Primary Education curricula. Is this a waste of money I think not in view of the importance of getting our education on the right footing. I wish all citizens a peaceful and successful New Year.

He suggested that \\\"laws dealing with parental responsibility must be considered to ensure that the child does not become a criminal because of the recalcitrant parent\\\". An excellent suggestion indeed, except for the details in identifying the \\\"recalcitrant parent\\\" and as to what exactly constitutes any such parent. As I point out when I write and lecture about early childhood education (ECE), from age three to five, and what I choose to call early, early childhood education (EECE), from birth to age three, Parents cannot give to children what they themselves lack. How can anyone expect a parent or, if a child is fortunate, two parents, who have never themselves been properly parented to raise and parent a child Can society really label such parent(s) as \\\"recalcitrant We have many instances of what can only be considered children having children; do they have the parenting skills not to be labelled \\\"recalcitrant\\\" Also consider that according to the study done by ALTA that found that only about 45 per cent of adults can read this newspaper with some depth of understanding and that approximately 23 per cent of T&T citizens are illiterate. Can we logically categorise such parents as \\\"recalcitrant\\\" If a child has not learned behavioural skills, self-control skills as well as others such as language skills by the age of five, it is most often too late. Consider also that in a well-documented New Zealand study, 24 per cent of the study cohort that had not acquired self-control by age three had, by age 30, acquired criminal records. So, by the time such a child enters the school system, he is too often unreachable and so too late for the semblance of an educational process to give him any chance of being a successful adult. What chance does this child have of himself not becoming a \\\"recalcitrant parent\\\" By age five, formal schooling starts and all children are thrown together; low socioeconomic children rapidly learn they can't compete. Resentment sets in, behavioural problems arise, fights are common and the drop-out problem arises. For children like this, are you not surprised that without the development of any skills that crime is too often the default career choice As has been proven in numerous studies of early childhood programmes, the path to these children and their parents is well-proven. It has been shown that the way to reach these children and parents is by sending teams of education specialists, psychologists, social workers, language specialists etc. into the Homes of such children to teach the child and the parent(s) what is necessary for the child to thrive and succeed. Only then will society be able to produce parents who have a chance to give children the tools to not become \\\"recalcitrant parent(s)\\\" themselves. The Government has over the past few years spent large sums of money and instituted many programmes to better educate children in an attempt to produce better citizens. We had a few years ago the spending of large sums of money to build early childhood learning centres throughout the country. The problem was soon discovered that there was no trained cadre of teachers and specialists to staff these buildings. So the Ministry of Education established an Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme at UTT to train such a cadre. But the teachers placed in the positions created are grossly underpaid. These are the most demanding of all teaching jobs and in order to attract quality student applicants, adequate pay scales have to be established. Teaching algebra is a worthy skill but nothing like the many skills needed to teach small children. For another example, the Government funded the hiring of 500 guidance officers and counsellors to combat school dysfunctional behaviour problems and planned a facility in Tobago to house a counselling clinic which would have educational, behavioural and clinical psychologists available on a daily basis. Both these programmes would have been unnecessary if these funds were put into ECE and EECE programmes. The private sector, with its specialised NGOs, has a role to play in helping to alleviate the problem. For example, the Cotton Tree Foundation (CTF) has a wonderful pre-school programme for low income disadvantaged children in St. Ann's. While they are very successful in helping these children they unfortunately do not have enough funding to form the necessary specialty teams to go into their homes. The CTF deserves more private personal and corporate contributions and also Government funding. Are such ECE and EECE programmes expensive Of course they are. However, it has also been demonstrated that there is a return on investment (ROI) many years later, many times more than the original cost along with the demonstrable added value societal benefit of reduced crime. So what is the problem here Why are these programmes not universal Do we not know what is necessary to produce results Of course we do. Then who should we then pin the label of \\\"recalcitrant parent\\\" on; pin it you yourselves. Instead of having yet again listen to the Minister of National Security tell you his plan to reduce crime, instead of spending billions of dollars on the forces and toys needed by these plans, instead of putting bars on your windows and building high walls around your homes thus creating your own prisons, you should individually and collectively pressure your elected representatives to fund and institute the programmes we know will be successful to produce socially responsible citizens. Since politicians cannot see beyond the next election, unless a bottom-up demand and democratic-style push is placed upon them, your elected representatives will not act. It is all too easy and self-satisfying to blame the Government all the time; the Government is you and as such, you are responsible for it.

Trinidad and Tobago's Lendore place first and Berry second. Photo: AP Last week I wrote about the tragedy of blind faith in relation to religion and politics. This week I will continue on this topic but in relation to education and norms. It is my belief that the unwillingness of our citizens to question and address norms, values and education is one of the foundational flaws of our country. It is one of the root causes of the many ills we are experiencing today. It is necessary to acknowledge that there are many positive and uplifting aspects of our norm set and education. We are a people who transcended slavery, indentureship and all manners of oppressive horrors to build our nation. In education we continue to produce brilliant people who rise above their peers and go on to become leaders and elites in their respective fields. However, there are foundational problems with our norms and education. It is not my intention to criticise and highlight only the bad. Rather, I am seeking to point out the flaws and shortcomings of these institutions so that we can begin to rectify them. On norms, I cannot stress how much of our problems and issues can be attributed to this point. We as a nation have become accustomed to following norms without question. We have a tendency to follow a set of norms that were appropriate to a certain time and context and are unwilling to reshape and restructure our norms to reflect our present. For example, the patriarchal structure of our society and many of our national institutions date back to the times of colonialism. The favouring of men over women, the hyper-masculinisation of men and the de-sexing and de-humanising of women can be traced back to the slave fields, to white colonial controls and cultural prejudices. Women were expected to be subservient to their male relatives and the men were not to be questioned or opposed. Despite the very few public women in positions of power, the subjugation of women continues. To take the norms of gender relations even further the role of men as masculine, the \\\"village ram\\\" or \\\"badjohn\\\" has morphed into the stark criminal behaviour we see today. Young men in seeking to prove their masculinity are violent toward others, just as violence was meted out to them. Furthermore, they seek to impregnate as many women as possible to prove their virility but cannot take care of their offspring, leading to fatherless children and an entire cycle of violence. In a society where we expect boys to be hardy, rough, violent and promiscuous, is it not surprising that we are plagued by so much violence We set the stage and the structures of violence and the drug and arms trade provide the tools for them to perform their expected roles. Blind acceptance of norms goes far beyond gender and violence. We still operate under a colonial mentality that white is right. We refuse to place science and logic, facts and knowledge into our values systems and instead rely on false or outdated sources of conduct. We as a nation turn a blind eye to child abuse, animal abuse, domestic violence etc because \\\"dat is none ah we business\\\". We continue to sexualise all of our cultural arts and yet are shocked at sex scandals in schools. Sex has been going on in schools since there were schools, the only difference is now there are cameras and phones to record. Norms in relation to sexual orientation, in relation to child rearing and medication, healthy living and community are all very much flawed, yet we refuse to change; \\\"dat is de way it is\\\" is the usual rebuttal of those who are set in their ways. This is not to say that we should do away with all the old. Rather we should endeavour to adjust our norms and values to create the equitable, just and peaceful society that we crave. The blind acceptance of education is also another fundamental issue with our nation. I will need to traverse carefully along this explanation if I am to get my point across. Education is supposed to be much more than the knowing of facts and the memorising of \\\"knowledge\\\". Rather it is supposed to be an enquiry project where basic understanding is used to challenge and push the boundaries of what is called \\\"education\\\". From primary school all the way to Form Five the general pupil needs to be imparted with basic knowledge, facts, figures and skills. From A-Levels however, pupils are supposed to be prepared to question the question and push the limits of their minds. At university this is supposed to bloom. Sadly, the pushing of boundaries and the expanding of frontiers is not something that is taking place in our system. We are not equipping students to question and think critically. In this point it is not the student who is at fault, rather it is the cumbersome, detached and uninformed bureaucracy who design education curriculum who accept the old style of learning without question. They refuse to see that a student in 2012 cannot be expected to learn like a student in the 1950s. Time and technology has fundamentally altered the pedagogy of teaching and learning and we need to catch up. It is not too late for us to try and push the boundaries of what we accept even at the foundational level. We should as a nation realise that we are not perfect and that there is much work that needs to be done. The best way to grow and to learn is to open our minds and reject blind faith in any and all things. Rajiv Gopie won the President's Medal in 2006 for business/modern studies.

But, according to psychological studies, this will be achieved only if the students become less religious. And, if RE makes more people more religious, crime and corruption in Trinidad and Tobago may get worse. This is not the view of the country's present Prime Minister, however. When she was Minister of Education in the UNC administration 15 years ago, Kamla Persad-Bissessar told the audience at an ASJA fund-raising function: \\\"There is a fair amount of empirical evidence that points to the contribution that religion makes to healthy human development, especially in the development of the young.\\\" But in their book Atheists, North American psychologists Bruce Hunsberger and Bob Altemeyer cite their research which found that, the more religious people were, the more narrow-minded they became. \\\"As religiosity ranges from 0 to 100, so will dogmatism, zealotry, authoritarianism, and prejudice generally increase,\\\" they write. Their studies encompassed Canadians and Americans who went to church regularly and those who went only occasionally. Non-believers scored lowest on this list of undesirable traits. However, psychologist David G Myers, whose psychology textbooks are widely used in American universities, says the opposite in his book A Friendly Letter to Skeptics and Atheists. \\\"In nearly every one of more than two dozen studies, faithful church attenders exhibited less prejudice than irregular attenders,\\\" Myers writes. \\\"...it seems that, among the churched, the devout exhibit less prejudice and deeper feelings of human kinship that the nominally religious, who are somewhat more likely to rationalise prejudice with the aid of religion.\\\" In Trinidad and Tobago, religion is also seen as a key to academic success. Religious leaders continually claim that it is the religious character of the denominational schools which account for them producing most of the top 100 SEA students and taking the lion's share of CSEC scholarships. Maha Sabha head Sat Maharaj, for example, in a 2007 article in the Trinidad Guardian wrote: \\\"A successful education system must, therefore, provide for the cultural and religious needs of the children. Lack of State subventions for priests, pundits, and imams to teach religious values must impact negatively, especially at the state schools.\\\" However, at the formal opening of a national consultation on the primary school curriculum on April 5, Education Minister Tim Gopeesingh noted, \\\"The denomination boards cream the top and put them into their so-called prestige schools, so they must get better results at CSEC, CXC. So you only get good results at CXC and CSEC because you have the best students coming to your school.\\\" Other factors may be more pertinent to the academic performance of these schools. Criminologist Ramesh Deosaran has done research showing that the majority of students in the \\\"prestige schools\\\" come from two-parent families which are mostly upper- and middle-class. (See Table 1.) Studies show that these factors are more relevant than a religious upbringing to doing well in school and avoiding serious juvenile delinquency. Moreover, studies in other countries have consistently shown a negative correlation between IQ or education and religiosityi.e. the higher people's IQ or educational attainments, the less likely they are to be religious. For example, a 1996 study by psychologists EJ Larson and L Witham showed that over two-thirds of the most eminent American scientists do not believe in God or an afterlife, as compared to a mere ten per cent of the general American populace who also rejected such beliefs. Table 2 shows the religious affiliations of UWI students at the St Augustine campus, compared to their respective proportions in the wider population. The percentage of students who did not state their religion is twice that of the general populace (or seven times that of the national census who put \\\"None\\\").

Professor Theodore Lewis We may begin the discussion of education between Emancipation (1834) and Independence (1962) with the report of Joseph Latrobe, who in 1837 was sent by the British parliament to see how money from the Negro Education Grant was being spent. Latrobe wrote in his report that \\u201cThe colony has laboured under greater disadvantages than many of the West India Islands, from the prevalence of the French and Spanish languages, and of the Roman Catholic faith, and also from the manner in which its motley population is found scattered\\u201d. It must be remembered that the Church of England (Anglicans) is led by the English monarch, while Catholics are led from Rome (Italy) by the Pope. Latrobe said, \\u201cIt appears evident that before emancipation the education of the negro was carried forward in all these colonies, \\u201cmore or less, under every dis-advantage.\\u201c The colonial legislatures were openly hostile to it; and so were the majority of proprietors and administrators of estates. Thus, he wrote, \\u201cThe schools to which the negro had access were, for the most part, of but poor pretensions.\\u201d Governor Lord Harris came in 1849, shortly after the first set of Indian indentures arrived. He introduced primary schools in each ward of the country, insisting that the schools must not have a religious flavour. It should be clear by now that after emancipation there was a missing voice in the discussions about the education of the ex-slave\\u2014the voice of African forebears. There is no record in Caribbean history of anyone asking Africans, now freed from slavery, for their views on what form their education should take. Africans were no longer slaves, but they were not citizens either. They had no say in their education. Carl Campbell sheds important light on the formative years of secondary education in the country, with the main actors engaging in conversation about the curriculum and its proximity to the requirements of Oxford and Cambridge. Classical education was the order of the day. As with primary education, the main tension with secondary was whether the orientation of the curriculum should be religious or secular. Two significant secondary schools for boys emerged in Trinidad in the 1850s, the Queen\\u2019s Collegiate School (later Queen\\u2019s Royal College) supposedly secular but really an anglicised institution, established by the colonial government, and St Mary\\u2019s College established by the Roman Catholics, and championed by the French Creole population who had appealed to Rome to establish a counterpart to QRC. Convents for girls had been established before emancipation. These secondary schools were for the children of the ruling classes, white and coloured, who were admitted to the schools based solely on their colour. They did not have to take exams. For the children of Africans, a different logic of admission obtained, particularised to academic giftedness. A handful of black children, three or four, could be admitted periodically if they topped the island in a special exam. The Presbyterians entered the fray late in the 19th century, taking special interest solely in the education of the children of indentures. They were blind to the African child, and never ventured to Tobago. Following the establishment of QRC in the 1860s, the colonial state did not establish another secondary school on the island, until 1953, when St George\\u2019s College was founded. These were the only two State run schools here when Eric Williams and the PNM came to power in 1956. How do you run a country, with education so crucial to state formation, if the secondary schools are not under the control of the state? The PNM government and the denominations agreed to a compromise in the Concordat of 1960. The denominations could prescribe 20 per cent of the intake. Since whites and coloureds constituted less than 20 per cent of the population, all their children could attend the prestige schools. Some still want the Concordat to prevail, even though we no longer have conditions of scarcity in education. We have gone from two government schools in 1953 to the 37 pages of schools filled with the SEA results this year. No other country in the Caribbean allows churches to come in and take their share first. Not Barbados, not Jamaica. The country has been held with its head over a barrel based on the Concordat compromise, made in 1960, at a time when we did not have any of the highways we now have, when people bought butter by the ounce, and all of the houses on streets where I lived had a pit latrine. Our current SEA examination process is premised on a status quo of unequal schools that children and their parents understand in terms of first, second and third choices. Each choice reflects a different order of quality. Why do we not have first, second and third choice water, hospitals and electricity in this country? Secondary schools, like primary schools in this country, are of unequal quality, therefore children of every creed and race do not find an equal school place. Here at Emancipation 2019, 185 years on from Emancipation 1834, the black child remains at the margins of the education system, more likely to graduate to the remand yard than to the university.

Professor Theodore Lewis WE are now 185 years on from emancipation. Recently deceased historian Colin Palmer made the fact of an African diaspora in the Americas a pillar of his scholarship. In 1863 as the American civil war raged, President Lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation declaring the slaves free. Slavery was the reason why slave owning confederate southern states had broken away from the Union, and hence the basis of the war. Emancipation was a death blow to them, because it meant they had no slave empire to which they could return. The proclamation changed the status of blacks from slave to free. The news spread among them that they were no longer slaves. Black men joined the Union army in droves. Come 1865 and the Civil war was over. Immediately after the war, concessions were made to blacks including the establishment of the Freedman\\u2019s Bureau to begin an assault on illiteracy by the creation of educational institutions. That led to the establishment of Howard University, among others. Blacks themselves on a clandestine basis, throughout slavery, had built a network of schools. When the civil war ended those from the Northern states who had been free all along, migrated in droves to the south and quickly established a vast network of elementary and secondary schools along with teachers\\u2019 colleges, for their brethren. This effort of self-help is well documented by WEB Dubois in Black Reconstruction, and by James Anderson in The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935. It has no counterpart in Caribbean slavery. Fast forward to 1954, and American blacks found themselves before the Supreme Court fighting for the right to quality education for their children. Official school segregation had forced them into separate schools that were poorly funded and equipped. Violence against them kept black children out of white schools. The Supreme court agreed in Brown v the Board of Education, that indeed separate schools were inherently unequal. Here at home the slave trade was abolished in 1806, one year earlier than elsewhere in the British empire, Trinidad being set aside as the model for crown colony rule, as James Millette has espoused. A key feature of the model was amelioration, intended not to abolish slavery but to reform it. In an address to the British parliament in 1824 on the question of amelioration, Colonial Secretary Canning said the following: \\u201cWith respect to Trinidad, I cannot omit to observe that about twenty years ago I in this House called the attention of government to that colony, the possession of which was then recently confirmed to us by the peace; and submitted a motion to the effect that Trinidad should not be placed on the same footing as our other colonies by the grant of a legislative constitution; but should be reserved under the unfettered dominion of the Crown, for the purpose of experiments for the amelioration of the condition of the slaves.\\u201d In a 1932 article in the Journal of Negro Education, titled \\u201cThe Neglected Period of Emancipation in Great Britain 1807-1823,\\u201d Charles Wesley wrote that the logic of leading abolitionists was that Africans would be unable to deal with complete freedom, and hence a period of gradualism was needed by them. In \\u201cSlavery and Freedom in the British West Indies, 1823-33: The Role of Education\\u201d Olwyn Blouet writes that: \\u201cThe imperial commitment to amelioration in 1823 had a marked impact on the development of education in the British West Indies. First, nonconformist missionaries stepped up their activities to prepare slaves for freedom. They opened schools when and where they could. Some missionaries were independent of planter patrons. The missionaries became unofficial agents of imperial policy with a claim to imperial protection.\\u201d Blouet writes further that \\u201cThe British government hoped that the Established Church of England (the Anglican church) would be the religious and educational arm of amelioration. Education was intended for moral regeneration, to lift slaves out of degradation and barbarism.\\u201d The archbishop of Canterbury has recently apologised for the fact that the Anglican church had inherited and owned slaves at Codrington Estate in Barbados. Amelioration failed for a host of contested reasons. With its failure, the abolishment of slavery and the emancipation of slaves became plan B. In Capitalism and Slavery, still the most persuasive explanation of why Caribbean slavery collapsed, Eric Williams illustrated the economic decline of sugar. At the point of emancipation, the parliament passed the Negro Education Grant, which set aside \\u00a3235,000 to be spent on education across the region. Religious denominations were to compete for the funds available to establish schools. A first-hand account of schooling in the early dawn of emancipation was provided by Joseph Latrobe, who in the service of the parliament was sent in 1837, to make observations on the status of the school systems and disbursements in Jamaica, Trinidad and British Guiana. In Trinidad he reported unhealthy contest between the French and English on the island for dominion over education, to be seen in the jostling between the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches for the right to subventions intended for establishing schools.

Interestingly, the debate on education once again surfaced as retired principal Justin Paul, who received a Chaconia Medal (Gold), said that the shift system in secondary schools is responsible for the escalating crime in the country. The strengths and weaknesses of our education system have been the source of ongoing discourse. Some have lauded the system, recognising that this country has produced some of the finest minds in the world. Students from Trinidad and Tobago excel wherever they go, particularly in universities in North America and Europe. Foreign faculty and students alike are impressed by the quality of our students, particularly those who have earned scholarships and opt to study abroad. The significance of education has been recognised by our leaders over time, with several administrations experimenting with various policies in an effort at improvement. It was Dr Eric Williams who, on the eve of this country's independence from Britain on 30 August, 1962, said that \\u201cto educate is to emancipate\\u201d. His famous message has never been forgotten as he stated that \\u201cYou, the children, yours is the great responsibility to educate your parents, teach them to live together in harmony\\u2026To your tender and loving hands, the future of the nation is entrusted. \\u201cIn your innocent hearts, the pride of the nation is enshrined. On your scholastic development, the salvation of the nation is dependent\\u2026you carry the future of Trinidad and Tobago in your school bags.\\u201d Dr Williams meant well but there is some truth in Paul's assertion about the deficiencies of the junior secondary school system. Pupils enjoyed considerable free time during the hours when they were not at school and some would have used that time to indulge in negative activities which contributed to the high crime rate in this country. However, there are other factors which contribute to crime including culture, poor parenting, politics, lavishing children with material things, deficient curricula, the drug trade and the lack of a comprehensive youth development policy, amongst others. Even without the shift system, discipline problems are quite high in the secondary schools, including the so-called prestige denominational institutions. Some of the most notorious trouble-makers are privileged children from affluent homes. In short, there are many factors accounting for criminal activities which can be attributed to a web of historical and social problems that have festered over time. The result is a high number of hungry, alienated, hopeless, rich and poor youths who find it difficult to cope with the demands of academia. There are those who are spoilt rotten with all the material comforts in life and who do not appreciate the value of hard work and sacrifice. Some of them make it to university but struggle to complete their programmes as they get distracted with drugs, including alcohol. The lack of meaningful employment opportunities is also contributing to the crime crisis. The hard-working, diligent student who struggled financially to secure an education but cannot find a suitable job after graduation is left frustrated. Quality education continues to be a challenge as the heavy emphasis on academics leaves many students unprepared for the needs of this society, particularly the increasing demand for skilled workers. Even so, a high number of tertiary students have difficulty writing proper English. Spelling, style and grammar leave a lot to be desired, making them ill-prepared for the world of work. Yet, today's youths have an amazing grasp of technology and are quite tech savvy when it comes to mobile phones and computers. But the language of the chat line is unacceptable in the classroom and for examinations where some students' inability to communicate in good standard English really comes to the fore. Some students are only pursuing education at the tertiary level because their parents insist that they get certified. But this certification may not even get them a job in their field as the rate of underemployment escalates as thousands of students graduate with each passing year. Nevertheless, education remains the only way forward for the majority of our youths and certainly the best route out of poverty. Youths must understand that it has more than economic value as it moulds their personality, intellect and overall development and impacts their capacity to think, analyse and make rational decisions. Neither should we forget the many educators who have laboured in the classrooms over the decades. For a long time, teachers and principals have endured low salaries, poor working conditions and inadequate resources in their valiant efforts to uphold a noble profession which is not given the recognition it deserves. So, as the country prepares for the rat-race with the reopening of classrooms on Monday and the concomitant mad rush, traffic and possible torrential September showers, it would be useful to remember the watchwords \\u2014 live, love and learn.

I am making a distinction here between a professional association and a union. This is not an academic difference. The aim of a union is to present a united front for workers that strengthens their bargaining position on matters relating to conditions of work, pay, promotion and so on. The aim of a professional association of teachers is to improve the practice of teachers, and to establish codes of ethics or behaviour that can help guide their work. These are not necessarily mutually exclusive aims, but the impetus of associations can serve as a limit on what a teacher is prepared to do where service to children or obligations to them are concerned. I am provoked to write this column by the weekly, and sometimes daily, e-mails I continue to receive from the Minnesota Technology Education Association, though it is almost a decade since I worked in the state and was a member of that association. The same is the case regarding frequent e-mails I receive from the American Education Research Association asking me to renew membership, something I gave up when I retired from university teaching in the United States. In the US, university level professional associations are parallel to those that serve elementary and secondary teachers and aim to improve practice in subject fields. An exemplary association that can be drawn upon here to help the point is the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). This association has all the classic features of a professional association of teachers. In the first instance membership comes with paying annual dues, with the option to subscribe to the array of professional journals and other publications put out by the association. NSTA produces journals for science teaching at all levels of schooling, from elementary to secondary. These journals bring to teachers the latest in science practice that can inform their teaching. There was a time in T&T when science teachers were organised, not as a union, but as a professional body, with an important journal, ASSETT, that kept teachers up to date. Technical and vocational teachers, too, were professionally organised in T&T. We held regular meetings, and an annual conference. We had the ear of the Ministry of Education. One may argue that locally we have a union in the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Association, and that the professional needs of teachers can be served through it. I don't think so. Unions and professional associations are diametrically opposed when it comes to service to children. For one thing, unions require group-think, or collective response. For example, you may be called upon to stand outside of your school and picket the principal. What if your instinct is not to do that, but instead to stay with your form four class that is having difficulty with technical drawing or mathematics Union thinking could make that dangerous, even for teachers. Here a teacher becomes no different from an oil worker, and with respect, that really ought not to be the case. Professional associations foster individualistic thinking. It might impel the teacher to say that children must not be punished in the service of some union aim. There are a host of issues in our schools that seem to me to require a new wave of professionalism, as opposed to unionism. For example, many children in schools in depressed areas are not performing well academically. Many children are struggling with mathematics, or with standard English. These are not union concerns typically; but they would be the concerns of professional associations. What do we know about the urban child here What strategies are there that can be adopted in urban schools to help the many lost children within them The education landscape in the country is virtually devoid of professional organisations related to teaching. There are no active teacher professional associations in art, music, mathematics, science, geography, or language. There are no local journals produced and circulated by teachers aimed at improving teaching. I have some familiarity with the SEA mathematics syllabus and know that many teachers and parents would have difficulty with it. If there were elementary education associations, there could be sharing of strategies on how to teach aspects of the mathematics curriculum. Professional associations require a different mindset from unions. A teacher is not a construction worker, or a boiler mechanic. You can't just take a day off for rest and reflection, or whatever, when children are the bargaining chip. Associations require teachers to think individualistically, against the backdrop of codes of ethics. Teachers must draw upon professional conscience sometimes, and to find ways of bargaining that do not require holding children and their parents hostage. There is a great need for groupings of teachers in this country to get together professionally in the service of the advancement of school subjects they teach. Our professional landscape in teaching here is a desert. It is one of the reasons why failure abounds in many schools. Teachers are not taking failure personally, and they should.

They are less sure when facing the expectations of the modern world for entrepreneurship, thinking outside the box, seeing as-yet-unimagined social, civic, economic, ecological possibilities. The need is for students and citizens who can reason, think critically, problem-solvethink, question, reject and synthesise. These are not capacities that are easily captured by standardised test formats. Both Singapore and Finland are considering the adjustments they need to make! (We note that we have stellar \\\"book-learners'' and \\\"test-takers'' in T&T who can compete with the international beston the SEA, for example. What we do not know is how well they do in the world. Do we have ten-year and 20-year outcome data on these successful examination takers) China is another country that in a relatively few years has produced an amazingly successful educational system which incorporates many attributes of the Singaporean system. They too, like the Singaporeans and the Finns, are starting to recognise the limitations of knowledge and skills acquisition unleavened by the yeast of creativity. China is able to turn out thousands of engineers: they do not all have the ability to think to the next level, to make the innovations necessary to respond to the needs of a complex society. They too are looking elsewhere for the sources of critical thinking, problem-solving, and entrepreneurship. So what do we mean by a \\\"new educational paradigm'' If he is serious in his goals for T&T's education system, Dr Gopeesingh needs to abandon the application of plasters to the T&T education system as is, and, taking a public health approach, should build from the bottom. What does that mean here It means building a totally new, parallel, education system improving, to the best standards possible, the lower forms while carrying along the current system as best as can be done. Those upper classes remaining will be no worse off than they currently are until all are graduated out of the old system. So what does building a new system involve First, it involves a totally new attitude about and toward teachers. Teaching has to be highly valued as not only an occupation, but as a career. In order for that to even start, the pay scale has to start at salaries commensurate with those found at the mid-executive level. A college degree is to be the minimum standard; Masters level degrees are to be encouraged and even required for some teaching specialties; teachers should be paid accordingly. Bonuses should be offered to those who are interested in, and show an aptitude for, pre-school, kindergarten and primary classroom teaching. Establishing the foundations of learning in the youngest learners is the most important goal of an education system; the most demanding teaching skills are needed at these levels and should be recompensed accordingly. With competitive pay scales, a teaching career will become attractive as a career choice to those graduating in the upper 1/3 of their university classes. Competitive and attractive pay scales will also attract more men into teaching thus helping to alleviate the surplus endangered-species male population problem. Once these become a part of the system, we will be able to expect responsibility and, that key word, accountability, from the teachers. A well-paid, highly respected, greatly valued member of society will not have much issue with a concept of wanting to perform well amongst a peer group and for society. Second on the agenda is setting up an entirely new teacher recruitment and training programme. In this regard T&T can learn from the systems that work well in countries like Singapore, Korea, Finland and the like. There is no need to re-invent the wheel. Included in the new model will also be the lessons learned from the best of the more progressive educational philosophies from countries around the world, those that foster the ability to reason, to think critically, to problem-solve and to be able \\\"to think outside the box''. Third, a complete sub-training programme to train teachers whose focus will be to provide teaching services for what we call Early, Early Childhood Education (EECE), involving those children from birth to age three, and for Early Childhood Education (ECE), involving those from age three to five. These periods are the most important times in the education timeline of a child. If you do not \\\"get them'' by age five, you have lost them and trying to play \\\"catch up'' after that is extremely difficult and very, very expensive. A fourth link in this chain will be maximising the development of all T&T children. For this link it will be necessary to include nutrition and early childcare programmes, to empower paediatricians and social workers at the community level, to establish units of occupational and physical therapists, speech-language therapists, neuropsychologists, behavioural psychologists, medical specialists such as audiologists, ophthalmologists, dentists, plus training specialty teachers and educational therapists. All these will be necessary elements in order to provide the care and resources for children to develop to their full potential and get whatever supports they may need to thrive in the school setting from preschool onwards. The fifth link extends the provision of the fourth. Specialist teams should be developed to provide remediation services to those children with specific learning disabilities (SLD: an estimated 15 per cent of all learners in any society). The teacher training programmes will include coursework and practicum experiences to enable teachers to recognise SLD. No society can afford to waste any potential for learning in any child; the primary obligation of an educational system is to enable every child to ultimately become a self-sufficient, productive member of that society. Now, do we think that this society will embrace and implement the system we have presented Is Trinidad going to implement an education system that will meet the needs of the 21st century Is this going to happen in T&T If not, why not Trinis surely do not lack for brains, creativity or energy.

On her feet: Principal of Eshe\\u0092s Learning Centre Kit Cadette embraces founder Dr Elsa Lynch at the School\\u0092s 30th Anniversary Celebration at Tranquillity Methodist Church. All the international statistics indicate that there is a direct link between school difficulties and school failure and juvenile delinquency, Dr Esla Lynch, founder of Eshes Learning Centre, noted, as she addressed that schools 30th Anniversary celebration at the Tranquillity Methodist Church last Wednesday. As a testimony of Eshes success, Lynch reflected, that not many graduates of Eshes, a school which caters for pupils with learning disabilities and other challenges, had followed the path of delinquency. The school had produced many productive pupils, which included priests, university graduates, public servants, teachers, a doctor and other such persons who were contributing constructively to the society. In fact, Lynch pointed out that three former Eshes pupils had received national scholarships. But the path to this accomplishment has been paved with the vision and commitment by Lynch, and coloured by her passion for the disenfranchised. This saw her 30 years ago, starting the Eshes embryo at 7 OConnor Street on November 5, 1984, with just three full-time pupils, whose names she still remembers- Collin, Mark and Kyle. The school then had no name, no uniform, just a lot of boxes and charts and the desire to work with children who were having difficulties in the mainstream school system. In January of 1985 the school moved to Lynchs childhood home on Alfredo Street and the house became home and school. The children worked at the same table at which I had done homework many, many moons ago, often accompanied with licks, recalled Lynch whose dyslexia had been undiagnosed as a schoolchild. This experience of her own difficult school life fed her interest, specialisation, qualification and passion for Special Education, in which she had earned a doctorate. By this time the numbers of students began to grow and Lynch took on two other teachers. By this time January 1985 the school was not only offering academic support, but had begun an enrichment programme which included ceramics, pan, woodwork and sewing, sourcing these skills from the community. By 1986, with a waiting list of over 50 students, the school opened at Maraval. Thanks to the generosity and sacrifice of the Lynch family, who put both money and mouth in the venture, Eshes home is a big building with ample yard space located at 105 Arapita Avenue, Woodbrook. It currently has 31 full-time teachers and approximately 200 students. Recognising that it cannot reach every child with learning challenges, the school has held three national conferences and has gone into public and private schools providing guidance to teachers there on how to work with such children. In the last two years we have begun the process of forging a very important relationship with the Howard School in Atlanta, Georgia and has a result of that we have had seven persons from that school come to Eshes to conduct staff development workshops. And five of our teachers have gone to the Howard School, Lynch reported. Although she retired as principal, Lynch continues be active in the schools development and sits on the board of management, influencing both policy and perspective. The schools current principal, Kit Cadette is from the Howard School. Cadette, whose relationship with Lynch and Eshe predated her appointment as principal, stated in her emotional address: We want her (Dr Lynch) to know that her years of sacrifice have not gone in vain. And unlike so many schools that when the founder has handed over the school, the school loses its essence and in a real sense, its place in society, we commit to you Dr Lynch that your child (Eshes) will continue to bear much fruit. Psychologist Allyson Hamel-Smith, speaking on behalf of the board of management, also stated that goal was to make sure that the work started by Lynch continues hopefully long after we are all gone. She said boards work was based on the pillars underlying the strength of Eshes which included a deep and profound respect and serious commitment to children, consistent staff training and robust staff accountability, measured by the progress and behaviour of the students; and a relationship with the parents and community. Commenting that many people in the country were better off because of Dr Lynchs significant intervention in education, she said the school was committed to continuing her work. Parent of a former Eshes student, Pat Sookdar described Lynch as a mother, who helped to nurture confidence and competence in her (Sookdars) son, Jeremie, whose greatest happiness is now in the world of music. Parent of a current student, Pavia Paymah remarked that she could only genuflect to the teachers at the school for giving her son the necessary life skills, academic background, good manners, the ability to interact with others and the capacity for a wealth of information. Most importantly, Paymah observed, the teachers at Eshes gave love. Rev Harry who delivered the homily picked on the significant of giving love. Time is teaching us how valuable love is, he said, noting that the staff and management of the school were engaged in a labour of love. Today we celebrate a milestone but the love continues, the love for God, the love for wisdom and the love for special children, he asserted. Greetings were given by a representative of the Ministry of Education on behalf of Dr Bharathsingh, manager of Students Support Services, Mrs Grant and Mrs Cupid. The representative noted that Lynch was a pioneer in working with children with hidden disabilities in the days when no one knew what this was and when no one was prepared to work with such children.

In a statement from her office yesterday, the Prime Minister admitted that this week had not been a good one for the children of Trinidad and Tobago, with the deaths of two toddlers by drowning, while a nine-year-old was murdered in what police described as a gang-related incident. Persad-Bissessar said there can be no greater terror for a young child than to desperately reach out to the ones they love and trust for help, and be met with aggression and violence. The mental and emotional torture, the anxiety, the sense of hopelessness and fright are unthinkable and we must, all of us, make the commitment that we will all take on the role of keeper of our nations children. The PM added: Over the years, however, even as we have progressed in a number of ways, incidents of aggression and violence against children, a number of them fatal, have been a source of revulsion, horror and a fervent commitment to do more, and do better for our children. Within the past week, we have seen two teenagers and a nine-year-old boy gunned down by criminal elements. We have seen the drowning of two small children who were apparently left unsupervised. Everyone still remembers the gruesome events which took the life of 11-year-old Akiel Chambers in 1998, with no justice to the family. On the side of Government, our vision has been to ensure that our children and young citizens are provided with every opportunity so that they can be supported to develop into grounded, socially-adept and intellectually-strong adults, said Persad-Bissessar. Through universal, free pre-school places for every child; a now fully technology-driven system of secondary education; much greater diversity of technical and vocational training programmes; community-based partnerships; legislative enhancements; full resource and technical support for the Childrens Authority, and direct intervention parenting and family policies, we have been able to expand our reach to protect our childrens lives and future, she added.

With authorities in Trinidad and Tobago struggling to contain escalating crime and with our murder rates at record levels, there has been an increase in calls from all sectors of society to focus on strengthening the home as a haven to raise healthier children and combat crime. Camile Swapp, director of Swapp & Associates is advocating a different approach. Her remedy is to combat crime at all levels, raise healthier adults and build stronger societies by focusing on the education system. Swapp, 45, who is a Guidance Counsellor and also serves as the Director of Youth Affairs at Vision on Mission, believes that the 'colonial' education system adopted by many English Caribbean countries is deeply challenged, harming the Caribbean male most of all. She has been advocating for a different approach to child development for the past 11 years. \\\"We have made mistakes in not checking on the needs of our young people, especially our learners,\\\" said Swapp during an interview at her home on Tuesday evening. \\\"There is a lot of research now about child and brain development, but we did not focus on that in the Caribbean. Our focus was on exam-oriented learning and we believed that if we taught the child everything and the child was able to recollect everything, the child was smart and ready to move forward whereas the child who could not recollect as easily was deemed to be stupid. We tended to see everything wrong with the learner and not really anything wrong with the system.\\\" This is the system within the school that Swapp believes must be changed to allow for healthy growth. A Jamaican by birth, Swapp is the wife of marine pilot, Elgin Swapp and mother of two daughters aged 17 and 11. Mr. Swapp's job has taken the family to different countries around the world and provided the Swapp family with an exposure to different social systems and different approaches to education. \\\"Eleven years ago our family lived in Sweden for some time,\\\" she recalled. \\\"When I was there I saw that the school positioned itself to understanding what is developmentally appropriate for young learners to do well from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. without extra lessons and the additional stress. The State held the school and parents seriously accountable for the way the child should be treated, promoted best practice systems in education and the schools actually provided the best environment for the children when the parents were at work.\\\" The Swedish education system focused on a nine-year comprehensive school for children between the ages of seven and sixteen so that most children in Sweden remained in the same institution for all of their compulsory education. Children are also offered the opportunity to stay in the school until 18 years, and many take up the offer. \\\"They taught the child at the level of the child's understanding,\\\" Swapp said. She also spoke of the education system in France where children were offered extra help during the school day for areas where they were challenged. The family moved to Trinidad five years ago when Mr. Swapp was offered a post in the Maritime Department at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. When his tenure at UTT ended, he joined the Trinidad and Tobago Marine Pilot Association where he is currently employed. While here, Swapp researched developmentally appropriate practices to promote joyful learning in school age children at the Caribbean Nazarene College and prepared an undergraduate thesis on the subject. \\\"Here in the Caribbean, our passion for education from the cradle to tertiary is mostly about certification and prestige and not enough about building nations so that while we have had people who have succeeded, too many felt less than or insignificant through the experience,\\\" she said. She encourages the school system to teach the child at an age appropriate level where he or she can understand and relate to their parents rather than hope that all parents are proficient teachers. \\\"That way we build the nation, we are better able to lift their generation higher than the one before,\\\" she said. \\\"Parents don't have the tools and best practices from a teachers' college. The current deviance among youths, sadness and apathy and lower levels of health mentally and physically among children is an indictment on our system.\\\" She believes that this system has placed the male student at a disadvantage. Research has shown that boys and girls learn differently and many educators have observed that boys learn better by non-verbal cueing and have a harder time than girls listening to a lot of words. While girls have better fine motor skills at an earlier age and are more fluent verbally, boys develop gross motor skills faster and are better at physical activities. \\\"By the time the boy is ready to wake up and really challenge with fine motor skills, he is out of school at form five at age 16, and what do you do then\\\" Swapp asked. \\\"The child needs to stay in the school system until 18 years, those two extra years are frightfully important.\\\" Swapp also slammed other pressures in the educational system that forced many parents to seek extra lessons to ensure that their children met the required standard. With the view that the school is the single institution that has the most influence in society as it touches the lives of all regardless of race, color, social standing or religious affiliation, Swapp believes that more attention should be focused on child development when developing a curriculum that is conducive to learning. \\\"It is not about 'dumbing' down the curriculum, but about finding a balance,\\\" she said. \\\"We must challenge our children, we must give them information, but it is wrong to use the test to say they are good or no good and use results to get them to certain schools. This is a true sustainable way to limit crime and we can make that change for 2011 and beyond. Having lived in Jamaica and also here in Trinidad, we have tried to change every system to combat crime except our education system. How can we not have done that That is the think tank and that is where the change in thinking must come. We have changed political groups. We have changed police commissioners. We have done everything except renewing the education system for our children in this modern world.\\\" She is taking her theory about education to the other level. In addition to publicly sharing her views, she formed the company Swapp and Associates together with her husband in 2010 and proposed to serve as the mediator between the home and the school. In April 2010, Swapp and Associates hosted US educator and child psychologist Dr David Elkind. This function was well attended, and to meet the demand for a repeat, Swapp and Associates would be hosting Dr. Jane Healey later this month. This conference is to be hosted at Paria Suites on January 14th. Persons interested in further information can contact Swapp and Associates at 732-4897, 741-4001 or 780-4654 \\\"I am really heartened by the feedback and the fact that a lot of educators want to know more about brain and child development,\\\" Swapp said.

The writer is an international journalist based in Port of Spain Sanjaye Shaw has not had it easy. As a three-month albino baby, he was dumped by a roadside in Red Hills, a tough Kingston, Jamaica, neighbourhood. He was left with a diaper and a pack of powdered milk. The woman who found him took him in and raised him, alongside her eleven other children. Even when lunch money was short, his adoptive mother scraped his bus fare to school. In Jamaica\\u2019s colour-conscious society, albinos come bottom of the heap. An adopted albino kid in a hard-bitten neighbourhood could easily go under. Instead, Sanjaye passed for Kingston Technical High School, then for Jamaica\\u2019s University of Technology. Gleaner columnist Mark Wignall quotes his words: \\u201cI cannot even begin to tell you the number of times I have had to fight for things that most people would take for granted. All I do is fight it and move on. I would be a fool to hold grudges for all this time.\\u201d Now 33, he has taught physics at Kingston\\u2019s Calabar High School for four years. He is articulate, and controlled. He has pushed up the CAPE pass rate from 37 per cent to 100 per cent. When I spoke to him this week, it was after nine at night. He had just finished teaching. So he\\u2019s star of the staffroom, darling of the school administration? Nope. In the December school break, he gave up his free time to run a physics camp for his pupils. Who tell him do that? With 63 pupils staying overnight, he needed some of the beds used by the school sports team. After a verbal set-to with sports coaches who weren\\u2019t keen to share equipment, Shaw says up to 60 athletes banged on the windows, then \\u201cfly the door open\\u201d and invaded the physics lab, two of them in the lead. He reports one saying: \\u201cTracks man run this school\\u2026 A feel like jus\\u2019 boxing you up inna you face!\\u201d Shaw told his pupils: \\u201cSit where you are. Don\\u2019t say anything.\\u201d He activated his phone\\u2019s video camera \\u2014the clip is now up there, online. He says one of the athletes \\u201cslap my phone out of my hand\\u201d cracking the screen; the boys dispute his account. All this sounds to me like a fairly serious breach of discipline, witnessed by 63 pupils, a parent, a guardian, a teacher and a semi-smashed cellphone. Shaw says he tried 19 times that night to contact the acting principal. The school\\u2019s reaction next day? Not much. And later? The weeks ticked past. Shaw says the school\\u2019s athletes taunted him in the corridors: \\u201cCopper-coloured boy,\\u201d \\u201cYu don\\u2019t finish mek yet,\\u201d \\u201cTake sleep and mark death\\u201d and \\u201cCoffin for you.\\u201d So what sort of a school is Calabar? It was established in 1912 by the Jamaica Baptist Union for children of ministers and poor blacks, A well-known alumnus is former prime minister PJ Patterson. Another is Adijah \\u201cVybz Kartel\\u201d Palmer, former \\u201cWorld Boss\\u201d of Jamaican dance-hall, and now serving a jail term for murder. Like T&T, Jamaica has prestige schools. Calabar is kind of semi-prestige in academics, ranking 39th on its CSEC five-passes results. But the school is super-prestige in athletics. In Usain Bolt\\u2019s homeland, athletics counts big. Shaw was told the athletes could not be disciplined: \\u201cThese boys are ambassadors of the school.\\u201d Well yes, they\\u2019ve put Calabar on Jamaica\\u2019s front pages these past weeks. After months of dithering, the two apparent ringleaders of the December attack were in March suspended for one week. They were allowed to work on CSEC school-based assessments and continue athletics training. One competed in a national sports event, the Digicel Grand Prix. So, let\\u2019s say, a semi-suspension. They were also told \\u201cseverely\\u201d they should not have gone into the physics lab. Three weeks ago, Shaw went public. He filed a formal police report. He went to a big-time English-origin lawyer, Lord Gifford. He held a press conference. The story hit the media. But he held back from pressing charges. Days after the row surfaced came the Boys\\u2019 and Girls\\u2019 Athletics Championships\\u2014the \\u201cChamps.\\u201d That event is huge in Jamaica. Held in the national stadium, it pulls mass TV audiences. Calabar\\u2019s team had won the big prize seven years in a row. This year they came second, 80 points behind Kingston College. Who was blamed for the loss? Yep, you guessed right. Shaw heard death threats: \\u201cHands steady with the \\u2018matic,\\u201d that sort of thing. In Jamaica, as in T&T, automatic gun threats from street-smart adolescents have to be taken seriously. On Monday last week, the assembled students showed their frustration as they waited for morning devotions. \\u201cKC a batty-boy school\\u201d went the chant, from sixth formers and juniors alike. Check it: there\\u2019s a viral video clip online. A well-established rival school gets a formal apology. Next day, Calabar\\u2019s principal, acting principal, head boy and seven other students made their way to Kingston College to express regrets. The school\\u2019s Board said the chanting was \\u201cabhorrent.\\u201d Students were called to a special assembly. Board representatives met education ministers and senior officials. There has still been no apology for Sanjaye Shaw. But he\\u2019s just an albino boy from Red Hills Road. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

She also said there was the need to go a step further and examine the historiography (systematic review of written history), rewrite the textbooks and erase the prevailing Eurocentric misconceptions. Shepherd made these comments Saturday after delivering the lecture themed In Their Name: Caribbean Women, Slavery and Reparation, at Andre Kamperveen Hall, Centre of Excellence, Macoya, Tunapuna. During the lecture, she had called upon Caribbean goverenments to honour more women as national heroines since they had fought in Emancipation Wars and to ensure they got reparations\\u2014including repatriation and resettlement in their homelands if they so desired. Among those present were Aiyegoro Ome, chairman of the National Action Cultural Committee (NACC) vice president of the National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) and Chairman of the T&T National Committee on Reparations. He was joined by Liseli Daaga, wife of Chief Servant Makandal Daaga and Senator Embau Moheni, Minister of State in the Ministry of National Security. Asked to share her sentiments on history being taught in the Caribbean schools, Shepherd said: \\\"What we have is the rhetoric that social studies is better than history. But what we are getting is the \\\"watered down\\\" version. Social studies has a little bit of economics, geography and history. What you find is the students are leaving school without a grounding in history. Unless they choose to do history as a subject for CXC, then there is no real emphasis on learning and studying history.\\\" Shepherd added: \\\"The Ministers of Education in the region would do well to make it a compulsory subject. It's sad they are leaving school without a clear knowledge about their history whether it is African, Indian or Portugese. There is the need for them to develop that sense of self-esteem and appreciation for their backgrounds. It is important for the development of their respective countries. We need to get back history into the schools.\\\" The Caribbean historiography is entrenched in colonialism, Indentureship and the Emancipation experiences. Shepherd said there was the need to revisit the historiography. She added: \\\"We have to do the textbook research and look at the Eurocentric view. We must look at the curriculum. We must also look at the selection of our textbooks and what is being taught to our children. We need to let our children know that Timbuktu is not a fictional place. It is a real place in Africa. There was a gold trade in Africa. The progress on the African continent was interrupted with the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. It is something Caricom needs to address because many times children and young people don't want to associate themselves with anything African.\\\" She also paid kudos to Trinidad and Tobago for being the first country to celebrate Emancipation Day. Shepherd recommended students of history and adults to read prominent Guyanese historian Walter Rodney's (How Europe Underdeveloped Africa), Frantz Fanon (Black Skins: White Masks), Lucille Mathurin Mair, the late CLR James Black Jacobins and the late Dr Eric Williams' Capitalism and Slavery.

The call comes in light of the fact that HIV/AIDS remains prevalent among the 15 to 19 age group, who youth activist Nicole Hendrickson said are many times misinformed on health and family life issues by their peers. Speaking at the North Central Regional Health Authority's (NCRHA) HIV/AIDS commemorative seminar at the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex (EWMSC) in Mt Hope last week, she said: \\\"Caricom Heads came together recognising the situation in terms of the STI and other things that affect young people and came up with a document that is Caricom-sanctioned and is supposed to be implemented, but we have been having some challenges getting it implemented in our school system.\\\" She added, \\\"We are asking the persons in authority... Ministry of Education, to implement something that is sound, that does not only include sexual education. It includes physics, it includes consumer health, it includes things on the environment... it's a comprehensive document. \\\"But we have recognised that because there is a sexual education component in it, we have been having some battles in having it implemented.\\\" She added that although Family Planning Association (FPA) data pinpoints the age of sexual initiation in Trinidad and Tobago as 14, a couple of years ago the age of sexual initiation had been identified as eight. From the data, she said, it is believed that the curbing of vertical transmission of HIV can be done by giving children age-appropriate sexual information, starting with the correct names of parts of their bodies. Dr Jeffrey Edwards, who also spoke at the seminar, looked at the basics of HIV/AIDS, which included its history and how the numbers of cases increased over the years, as well as the progression in treatment of the virus. (See Page 22) Other speakers included Dr Beni Balkaran, senior lecturer in Child Health at the University of the West Indies, who looked at developments in treatment for paediatric HIV locally.

As part of the University of the West Indies' distinguished open lecture series, Osotimehin is in Trinidad where he addressed an audience at the Learning Resource Centre at the UWI St Augustine campus yesterday on the topic \\\"Motherhood in Childhood. Facing the challenge of adolescent pregnancy.'' \\\"We at the UNFPA believe that comprehensive sexual education must be a part of education. The ability for the girl to understand, the ability for the girl to access correct information and the ability for the girl to access services if she does require it is a basic right she must have,\\\"stressed Osotimehin. Each day in developing countries 20,000 girls below the age of 18 give birth and each year 7.3 million girls give birth below the age of 18. Out of this number two million are under the age of 14, according to the latest report on the state of the world population compiled by the UNFPA. The rates of adolescent pregnancy in the Caribbean are among the highest in the world. The issue of comprehensive sexual education in schools is a contentious one, says Osotimehin but he contends that girls who are in school should be able to access information about contraceptives. He has seen first hand the benefits of such programmes. He was the director general of the Nigerian National Agency for the Control of AIDS which coordinates all HIV and AIDS work in a country of about 160 million people. In that position, Osotimehin established sexual education programmes throughout Nigeria. The result was that the uptake of information was high. What Osotimehin also observed was that these programmes also empowered girls and many started abstinence clubs in their schools. Osotimehin stated that in developed countries which have comprehensive sexual education that have delivered universal access to information and services with regards to contraception, the number of teen pregnancy cases decreased, whereas countries where this is absent, there are high rates of unsafe abortions and suicides. Osotimehin said the UNFPA is working with Caricom on the issue of adolescent pregnancy and key strategies to address it. Some of these strategies include sexual education programmes in schools, public policies at sub-regional levels to address gender equality and gender-based violence such as rape and incest and policies which ensure that girls go to school and stay in school. \\\"We know for a fact that when girls go to school and stay in school up to the age of 18 they tend not to have children and when they do, they have fewer children and they are able to make decisions for themselves,\\\" he said. Osotimehin served as Minister of Health in Nigeria prior to his appointment at the UNFPA in 2011. In recognition of his contributions as a leader of Nigeria's response to HIV and AIDS he was awarded the national honour of Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) in 2005.

Being vulnerable means being highly exposed to risks of death, disease, violence, abuse, torture, discrimination and all the like. It is a state of being at the fringes of society, the last to receive the benefits of the state and the first to bear the brunt of any fallout. At-risk or vulnerable groups are usually thought of as minorities, including the physically or mentally challenged, drug addicts, sexual minorities, etc, and to a large extent this is true. However, children are probably one of the most vulnerable groups in any society and yet they are far from constituting a minority. Children, for all of the rhetoric that is thrown around as being \\\"the future\\\", \\\"the leaders of tomorrow\\\", \\\"our joys\\\", etc, are exposed to levels of violence and are devoid of rights and protections in many societies to the point that they are dehumanised. Across the globe, children die by the thousands every day from starvation, dehydration, diseases, in war as victims or child soldiers, and in numerous other unspeakably horrible ways. Children are abused and tortured sexually and physically, girls and boys as young as three are sold in the sex trade or as house slaves. They are made to work in factories in India and Thailand to make the shirts and scarves we in the West wear; their broken, fragile bodies are the ones that keep the wheels of our consumer society turning. It is their tears, sweat and blood that keep us comfortable and happy. In Trinidad and Tobago, the situation may not be ideal but it is more than a million times better than across the vast majority of the global South. Children here, unlike the millions in the Philippines, do not have to eke out a living from the dumps and the drains. They, unlike the pre-teen girls and boys in the former USSR, have not been sold into the sex trade. They do not have to worry about being kidnapped and chopped into pieces for body parts for rituals and bush magic as in some parts of Africa. We are doing remarkably well as a developing nation. Guaranteeing education, books and nutrition up to secondary school is a monumental achievement and we must be extremely proud of this. The strides we have made toward universal education may seem \\\"normal\\\" to us, but across much of the globe education is a luxury afforded to a special few. There are millions of children in the Favelas of Brazil or the slums of India who have never been to school, do not even know what school is and are part of the drug trade or working ten hours a day for one US dollar to feed their families. There is, however, room for much improvement. Though we are part of the UN with its Universal Declaration of the Rights of a Child, we are far from implementing all of them. Children, unlike what some religious books say, are not property. First and foremost this must be understood, there is a tendency for much of the parenting populous to make the assumption; \\\"that is my child and I can do as I please\\\". Nothing can be further form the truth; a child belongs to the country, they are first and foremost citizens and, as a nation, we have a collective responsibility to ensure the well-being of every child within our territory and, as global citizens, all the children of the world. As a people we need to begin to understand that children have rights and among these rights are the rights to food and shelter, the right to be safe and the right to be heard. Too often most of us are continuing to believe children are to be spoken at and not with. It is not part of our child-rearing culture to talk with our children and consider their input: \\\"parents know best\\\" is an obsolete ethos with which to raise children. Apart from political rights many children in our country are still going to bed hungry due to poor families or other socio-economic factors. In a land of plenty, no child should have to do without the basics. The lack of proper parental planning and reproductive education is a sore point and until it is addressed children will suffer. It is a common refrain from most people that the \\\"poorest people have the most children\\\". This may, however, be an inaccurate statement as poverty may not be the element that we need to look at, as many rural families can take care of children quite well despite lacking orthodox measures of wealth. The problem lies with procreation by teenage mothers, abused mothers and sex workers, all of whom are vulnerable themselves and create a new generation of children to continue on the vicious cycle of suffering, poverty and exploitation. Social services for children and these vulnerable parents are one of the best ways to reduce the suffering of children. Thus children may make a great background to take pictures with for elections and they may make good political ploys, but they are not just to be used and left on their own. They are indeed our future, their condition is our condition. Right now the crime plaguing our nation is most times being perpetrated by youths and children, most under the age of 25. Just a few years ago they were young children, the violence and neglect many suffered are now being meted out to us as a country. We need to wake up and care for every single child, to make sure they are happy and well taken care of, protected and loved. We may bring children into the world, but they make our futuresit is high time we realise this. Rajiv Gopie won the President's Medal in 2006 for business/modern studies.

The professor has raised an issue which is central to the education system in Trinidad and Tobago and which we need to deal with as a major issue in education reform at all levels of the society from early childhood, straight through to university. I wholly agree with the professor that we have a certification crisis, and people who may have acquired certification have not benefited from the processes of development in skill and intellectual growth that the certification implies. The professor confines his argument to the tertiary level and argues that it is a matter of falling standards and institutional failure. Examinations are being \\\"dumbed down\\\" by some tertiary-level institutions, in order to jack up pass rates in the quest for profit. People with false certification are serving as teachers of the young, and the solution is that the authorities must become stricter about management of the system. I would like to add some thoughts to this issue of certification and education. My main concern is that this is not a matter affecting only tertiary level nor is it only about the weaker institutions at the tertiary level. This is a matter central to all arrangements for education in Trinidad and Tobago. It affects strong schools more than weak schools and is perhaps more infectious to those who pass than those who fail. The race for certification and the quest for passing is the main driving force in the school system, and it subverts the education processfrom primary to university. As someone who has been involved in the preparation of teachers for both the primary and secondary school systems in Trinidad and Tobago, I would like, in this article, to simply explain how teaching and learning are compromised by the quest for certification and, consequently, why we do not promote sufficient innovative or critical thinking in our classrooms. Completion of the syllabus, it seems, has become a serious challenge, and perhaps the sole purpose of schooling at all levels of the system, and I include the university level as well, as lecturers and teachers struggle to get in the coursemarks and the lecture sessions. At the primary level, if you show a teacher ways to engage children, get them involved in groups, manipulate materials, shade and draw or observe and experiment, they do it all while in training or under observation. Some honest teachers will actually confide in you that if they taught that way in their school, they would not be able to complete the syllabus. And if they are from a school that has a reputation in SEA (Secondary Entrance Assessment) to upkeep, then notes, practice and drills win out. Early-childhood teachers are now faced with the predicament where they are told that they are not preparing children well for primary school because they have not learned enough about numbers and reading and are unprepared for the long hours of seatwork or the harsh discipline. Primary school and SEA are, therefore, subverting the true nature of early childhood care and education (ECCE). Child development loses out as a result. Of course, at the secondary level, the story is the same. Any talk with teachers about discussion in the classroom, group work, problem-solving and case method is usually met with strong reservations or downright resistance. They explain that this would slow them down and they would not be able to finish the syllabus. They concede that they will do it while they are engaged in the teacher preparation programme but do not see how they can implement those approaches in their job. Exam preparation trumps all else. At the University of the West Indies (UWI), I suspect the story is the same. Do students get the opportunity to develop deep understanding of the subject matter How does the pressure of getting in the 40 per cent coursework affect the delivery of courses How do very large classes impact on teaching and learning Is there time to really explore and excite students So at all levels of the system, product wins out over process, and we end up with the situation that even those who pass are not able to display the creativity and imagination necessary to solve our problems. While it may be an issue all over the world, it is one that is having fatal consequences here at home. We need serious public discussion on this issue. Many educators have spoken and written about it. The title chosen for this article is the title of an article written by Lloyd Best years ago. What we have not been able to do is to agree on a way out.

In a release, the TTTI pointed out the need for \\\"proper procurement measures for schools' maintenance contracts, student placement after SEA (Secondary Entrance Assessment) based on ability rather than external influence, the fair and regulated award of scholarships and the halting of teacher absenteeism. \\\"To ensure that all money available for teaching our children is actually spent where it should (building schools, paying teachers and buying textbooks), the Ministry of Education should implement such anti-corruption basics as access to information on education policy, codes of conduct for educators, parent and student participation in governance, and clear systems of oversight and accountability across the education spectrum as issues that this country needs to deal with, in order to stop corruption in the education system.\\\" The release added the results of the comprehensive investigation into corruption in education sheds light on the many shapes and forms of corrupt practices in education, from the embezzle- ment of national education funds, hidden school costs, to the buying and selling of fake degrees. The report provides analysis and recommendations from over 70 experts in more than 50 countries on global trends in corruption in education, understanding the scale of corruption in school education, transparency and integrity in higher education, innovative approaches to tackling corruption in education. The results demonstrate that if we ramp up the fight against corruption in education, more children will stay in school and meet literacy and development goals. It will prepare the next generation to say no to corruption. The report also details numerous practical steps to prevent the abuse of power, bribery and secret dealings from corroding the education-al experience. \\\"For schools to educate the corruption-fighters of tomorrow, they need to be free from corruption themselves. Without a strong dose of integrity, our schools and universities will fail to provide future leaders with the basic tools needed to succeed, and more importantly, to combat graft,\\\" chair of Transparency International Huguette Labelle added.

Photos: Curtis Chase Raquel Matthews. Photos: Curtis Chase Twenty-six-year-old Raquel Matthews is a newbie in the area of school psychology, and how she got there makes for an interesting story. A resident of Goodwood Gardens, Diego Martin, Matthews started off at Savonetta Private School and went on to Holy Faith Convent, Penal where she attained seven 1s and a 2 in her CXC exams; she studied English A, English B, History, Principles of Business, Social Studies, Integrated Science, Geography and Mathematics. From there, she completed a year of cape at the same high school and then went on to Plattsburgh State University of New York where she majored in psychology with a minor in cultural anthropology. She now holds her MA and CAS in school psychology. But school psychology is not what Matthews had in mind, initially; it is not where she had thought she would find herself. In fact, she told me during the interview that, when I was younger, I wanted to be a dentist. But when I started Form 3, I had problems with integrated science. While she attained a 1 in integrated science in her CXC exams and it was a hard-earned 1 the sciences just were not her thing. So she had to find another niche. At school, I was angelic, she began in an effort to explain how she went from wanting to be a dentist to now being a school psychologist, but at home, I threw temper tantrums. I had a lot of problems with my family. I had a lot of therapy as a result; and throughout the course of my therapy, in observing the interaction between my psychologist and my family, and between my psychologist and myself, I grew to admire that interaction and began thinking about getting into that field. Without much ado, Matthews got on the Internet and began researching the field of psychology. She noted that she had googled education and psychology and was displeased with the information that she got back; however, there was a link, in the midst of all the information that she had gotten back that caught her attention. It was a link to school psychology. Her decision was made and in 2005, she flew out to the United States to begin her studies in psychology coupled with a minor in cultural anthropology at Plattsburgh. In her first year as an undergraduate and to fulfill her practicum, she worked as an aid to children in a pre-school. In my second year, I worked in a middle school and it was much more hands-on, counseling and leading social skills group. I remember that my first major test that year was dealing with a bipolar student and it was particularly harrowing because bipolar children can cycle in a day. Adults tend to take longer, she asserted. She completed three years of practical work and each year served to endear her more to her chosen field of study, and so, her chosen career path. Matthews returned to Trinidad and Tobago on June 5, 2012 and took up work at IAG & Associates where she worked closely with Isolde Ali Ghent and two clinical psychologists. I was offered a job at a high-school in Orlando where I did a full internship in my third year of practicum, but saw that there was a great need here for school psychologists; so I chose to return. That is not to say there is not a great need for school psychologists in the United States as well, but I prefer to return to my country and help out, she affirmed. And she has been doing just that. However, she is no longer with IAG & Associates. Driven by ambition, she has now set up her own practice in Palmiste, San Fernando and has her own clinical psychologist, Lydia Moujet-Ramcharam on her team. We work as a team and essentially, our company provides comprehensive psycho-educational evaluations, assist schools in identifying students they are concerned about and provide appropriate interventions. The big hurdle for us is getting out there, she said. I want people to know I am there; I charge the minimum fee $5,000 but I also take payment plans. Also, we do social skills groups for children with Asbergers and ADHD. We also do emotional literacy groups. Anyone interested in contacting Matthews can do so at raqsmatt@gmail.com.

Haiti will improve education for as many as 360,000 children from preschool through grade nine with aUS$50 million grantfrom the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The grant will fund the building of new schools, tuition-free primary education, student health programmes, and strengthen theMinistry of Education and Professional Training (MENFP) and its executing agencies. Twenty new public schools will be built, benefitting 8,200 children from preschool through grade 9. When completed, these schools will include equipped libraries, sanitary facilities, a school canteen, energy and water systems, and be made accessible to disabled children. The grant will also subsidise education expenses for 35,000 children attending primary non-public schools for two school years. The IDB contribution adds resources to an existing tuition waiver program, which is co-financed by the government of Haiti, theCaribbean Development Bank,CIDA, theGlobal Partnership for Education, and theWorld Bank. The programme is expected to increase retention and contribute to Haiti's goal of providing free and universal education to all six to 12 year olds by 2015.

As the family of Devindra Boodoo mourns, searching for questions, having done all the society told them they should do to get their boy ready for the next stage of his education, out from the woodwork comes the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association (TTUTA), the Minister of Education, the principals, all of them just like that, talking about the need for change, as though the issue is new. But when the mourning ends they will all go back to silence. They like it so. For four years this minister has been talking about removing the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) exam. But this is all carray and no bois. This same minister decreed that all extra-curricular aspects of the curriculum are to be delivered after school. He does not have a concept of a holistic curriculum, nor a vision of education for citizenship. As a man who is a medical doctor and who also made a Trinidad and Tobago 11 in cricket, he has a surprisingly conservative view of the curriculum. It is not just the minister. The churches are indicted on the count of actively participating in a system that lacks compassion for the multitude of children who come to school and who must take major exams starting a few feet behind the actual starting line. All of the attention is on the first choice children as though the rest of them are not our children too. It is not pure ability that causes most of the children who get their first choice to do well; it is the luck of the draw. I spent most of the last week at a conference in Bangalore, India, sponsored by Azim Premjie University, where much of the focus was on inequality in the Indian education system. One of the presenters, Prof Heredia, Fellow of the Indian Social Institute, New Delhi, said, eerily, and almost verbatim that \\\"In India we train children for exams, and when they fail they commit suicide\\\". He went on to say that people cannot be held responsible for achievements or choices when it comes to education. Nor can they be held responsible for natural gifts or talents they have or don't have. The role of governments, he said, was to strive to improve the condition of the poor. \\\"We cannot have fair competition in education if we do not neutralise starting conditions. The concept of a meritocracy should not apply in education.\\\" In India, the concern is that many poor people are forced to expend their scarce resources to remove their children from public schools to private schools, just to try to get them the English-based, high status education that companies prefer. The concerns are compounded by the very recent ruling of the Supreme Court of India that the government cannot impose a language, including the mother tongue, as the medium of instruction for primary education. Scholars are aghast at this ruling. In Singapore, for example, instruction must be bilingual, students being exposed to both English and a native language. Anuraj Behar, vice chancellor of Azim Premjie University, said in opening the conference, that in India some 30 per cent of children are now attending private schools, a percentage he said that is one of the highest in the world, and is shameful because it places the country in the company of failed states. Indian scholars at the conference, for which one of the themes was social justice in education, felt that the state should have as one of its primary goals the levelling of the playing field so that children come to the starting line of schooling without advantages or disadvantages that accrue mainly by the chance of who their parents are. Children do not pick their parents, just as they do not pick their race or gender. They find themselves born, some of them in homes where no one has ever done well at secondary school, some with homes without fathers, or without surplus income that could be spent on educational materials. In colonial times, these differences at birth were mapped onto schooling. When St Mary's College and Queen's Royal College were established in the 1860s, entry to them was on the basis of skin colour or privilege. Local children, like V S Naipaul, Eric Williams, CLR James and others, could attend these schools only by placing at the top in the College Exhibition. The elite got to attend school by virtue of colour, the masses by winning an educational tournament. Even though we have schools for all now, we still keep the tournament, knowing that those with the requisite social capital will win. But the 1860s are long gone.

Colombia, Jamaica, Venezuela, Mexico, South Africa countries with the highest crime rates in the world, more than 80 per cent of the people are religious. LAST week, when I read there was some lunacy being floated around that religion was going to be taught in schools, I almost blew a gasket. I started to write my column only to realise it was being driven by disbelief and anger and not by logic, facts, figures and academic proof which are what I base my columns on. I cooled off, decided to read the arguments of the proponents and then respond rationally. Examine the above data from the United Nations Criminal Justice Information Network, the CIA World Factbook and various national statistical agencies. Look closely at the countries that have the lowest crime rates and what does one notice Then look at those with the worst crime rates. What does one notice Yes, you are right the most religious countries are the worst in terms of crime, whilst the lowest crime rates exist in countries that have large numbers of non-religious people atheists and agnostics. I read an interesting argument that T&T is experiencing a high murder rate because of moral and social decay and in some odd way this is connected to lack of religious education! Is anyone as confused as I am To tell me that teaching religious studies in school is going to lessen crime is the equivalent of saying prayer will heal cancer and HIV. Well it has not and it is not going to. Schools are supposed to be bastions of wisdom, places where facts, figures, science, history and truth reign supreme. Not places for children to learn about stories from books that have been proven wrong so many times one wonders why revised editions have not been put out. Do not get me wrong. Religious tolerance is a worthy trait and should be instilled. But this should be done through the teaching of the social sciences, history and philosophy; through theological studies that dissect and analyse and many cases disprove religious theories. Not through forcing children to listen to people yap for hours about things that have no factual basis. Religious tolerance needs to be fostered though everyday interaction, cultural shows, exhibitions in school libraries etc, Not by forcing kids to zone out and they will zone out for an hour or so a week. If anything, kids will get more dismissive; if it is one thing that all people but more so children hate, it is to be forced to do anything. What about the non-believers, the atheists and the agnostics What will happen to them I know as a humanist/agnostic myself, if someone had tried to teach me religion in secondary school I would have been thrown out of class more times than I was, because I would argue endlessly. But what about the other students not like me who will sit there in discomfort for hours, being told stories that belief in some form or another of God(s) is the way to heaven One may ask, how many non-believers are there in secondary school Well, I interact with secondary school pupils online a lot. Any sample would show that while many are nominal members of some religion, most could not care less and believe even less. If you do not believe me ask a teenager if they really believe in what their religion says, the stories and myths. Be prepared for a surprise. They may say they are Hindu/Muslim/Christian, but only in name; they do not adhere to or believe most of what those religions teach. What exactly is going to be taught Is it a cursory review of the major religions Is it their principles, because the principles of two of the largest Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity) in our country are fundamentally incompatible with the Kumbaya notion being peddled in the articles I read. Those religions state that there is only one God their God, there is only one way their way and others will be cast to hell and fire and brimstone and so on. Is this what 14-year-olds are going to be told Which religions are going to be taught There are many minorities in T&T including some Kabir Panth, Baha'i, Baptists and Jews. Are their faiths going to be taught What of some of the lovely passages from those good books Are the homophobic ones going to be mentioned How will the gay/bisexual and lesbian youngsters feel The passages that call for the stoning of disobedient children, the ones that call people infidels, the one that says kill the Jew under the rock, the one that says fire will come to burn those who do not believe We would like some answers. School is for advancement, not fairy tales. It has been proven time and time again that as education increases, religion decreases, development increases and crime decreases. The teaching of religion is best left to the home and to the society that must demonstrate the values they preach. It makes no sense to have children learn about religion and then the imams, pastors and pundits go lambasting other faiths and either calling for them to repent, convert or be prepared for hell. What should be thought in school is knowledge grounded in facts and reality. With this knowledge comes power and this power crushes the illusion of religion. From this only good things come forth.

Professor Theodore Lewis In this second part of my series on the global resurgence of investment in pre-schooling, I focus on examples of this in selected developed and developing countries. The origins of this notion of educating small children might be the thought and practice of multiple great educators. Jean Piaget described cognition in children based on stages of development. Froebel noticed that brain growth is at its peak between birth and age three. In every culture, children learn the language by age two. In many countries, including most of Europe and in Singapore, small children are versed in more than one language. Rousseau believed in the idea of freedom in the early education of children. Pestalozzi emphasised activity-learning, involving hand and head. Lev Vygotsky introduced the notion of social learning. Learning takes place when conditions come together at what he called the \\u201czone of proximal development\\u201d. The child has to be psychologically ready for what is to be taught. Countries are understanding that the superstructure is only as solid as its foundation. Early childhood education influences later ability to learn. In England in 2003 a national system, called the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile, was introduced. It requires the assessment of children at age five in six areas of learning, ranging over social and emotional development, language and communication, problem-solving, knowledge and understanding of the world, physical development, and creative development. This has become the \\u201cEarly Years Foundation Profile\\u201d. The results are provided to parents. We see the great push to pre-schools in Europe where there is resolve to universalise early childhood care and education (ECCE). This can be seen in the European Union, reflected in the publication, Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care in Europe. The European Commission, which authored this 2014 document, explained that early childhood was the stage at which education has the greatest effect on children\\u2019s learning. It was noted in the report that only eight countries in Europe had thus far made the commitment to provide an early childhood place for all children, by legal entitlement. These were Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Malta, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and Norway. In the United States, there has been an upsurge in early childhood education, much of it having to do with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2002). The pre-kindergarten (PRE-K) movement is an outgrowth of this focus on early education. The coalition is comprised of organisations including the National Association of State Boards of Education, National Education Association, and American Association of School Administrators. It has set forth as policy that all three- and four-year-old children should have access to high-quality education. In support of the renewed focus on early childhood education in the US, the National Research Council has published the document, Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children. This work drew on the contributions of leading researchers and deals extensively with the challenges that could impair a small child\\u2019s ability to learn to read. It is made widely available on the internet. The Asian countries that perform so well on international academic tests do not now have a similar reputation where early childhood education is concerned. This is an area of education that policy makers in countries such as Singapore and South Korea have in recent times been according greater focus. These countries have found themselves with a dual system approach (day-care versus pre-school) that they are seeking to resolve. This dual approach can be seen across Asia, not just in Singapore, but in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. ECCE efforts are on the rise in Africa. One researcher pointed to challenges as Nigeria tried to meet UNESCO goals. Initially the government left pre-primary education to the private sector, but more recently has moved toward state involvement, consistent with an early childhood policy framework. Peculiarities of the African context for establishing ECCE in Africa can be observed. A 2017 study of ECCE in Ghana examined the perceptions of parents about pre-schooling. One parent explained that the purpose of ECCE for her child was \\u201cSo that his mind will open.\\u201d We get a sense of ECCE in India through a longitudinal study done by Dr Venita Kaul and her colleagues. They followed a cohort of 14,000 children for four years across three states in India. They noted that there are 1.3 million early childhood centres known as Anganwadis, across the country. The authors explain that the centres offer holistic packages of services for pregnant and lactating women, and children between ages three and six. They serve 82 million out of the 158 million children below age six. Closer home, in the Latin America and Caribbean region, there has been movement in ECCE. In a 1993 article, in the International Journal of Educational Development, Fernando Reimers examined ECCE in the region. Using 1988 as the baseline the percentages of enrolment in pre-school across selected countries was as follows, Cuba 99 per cent, Jamaica, 75 per cent, Guyana 51 per cent, and Trinidad and Tobago, five per cent. In his role as president of the Inter American Bank Luis Moreno in 2016 penned an op-ed in The New York Times making a plea for greater investment in early education in Latin America and the Caribbean, pointing to pre-school home interventions in Jamaica as a demonstrably successful initiative. A 2013 report on Latin America and the Caribbean by UNESCO acknowledged variation in the region but found that net pre-primary enrolment was 11 percentage points higher than the average for other regions in the world. Barbados was striking, showing 90 per cent progress to the goal of universal pre-primary education. THE AUTHOR chaired the cabinet committee on Elementary and pre-school education.

Adults underestimate how impressionable young people are. So ask yourself, what lessons the more than 700,000 Jamaican youth are ingesting from the avalanche of suspicions surrounding the dismissal of a minister of education? Who will explain to them what is truth? Who are they to look up to now? What are they to remember after the speeding motorcade of ministerial vehicles, the sirens, the brace of security guards (who are you afraid of anyway?) and the fawning of the ministry officials and incompetent advisers are all stripped away? And even the teachers ... in a profession heavily influenced in tone and trust by a minister, what are they to think? What are they to tell the pickney when his big portrait on every school wall is suddenly and disgracefully removed? A little counsel: Flashiness and show; stush, self-congratulatory bashes at Jewels, on the yacht and elsewhere are not what good governance and effective \\u00adservanthood make. Better to deal with the substance than the protocol. Just look at how \\u2018braff\\u2019 and lavish turn into the smelly stuff. Who paid for all the partisan extravagance anyway? The whole sector is now \\u00addemoralised by the circumstances surrounding the departure of its leader and the discrediting \\u00adsuspicions around several of the education-related \\u00adagencies. I grieve particularly for the Caribbean Maritime University (CMU), up to now a beacon of the kind of disciplined education and training most needed by poorly socialised pupils and most suitable for our global workforce needs. The CMU is too important to have any cloud of nepotism or corruption hanging over its leadership. Full and complete answers to all the questions regarding its connection with the Ruel Reid Foundation, any hiring of relatives, concubines and party hacks; full details of all contracts involving the ministry, are needed this week. They are already late! Next, please do not ignore the unease of individuals and organisations in the diaspora concerned about how monies donated through the National Education Trust are spent. Who decides which schools are favoured? Why could vastly more money be found to advance schools in NW St Ann but not for every other constituency whose schools are equally needy? Check SE Clarendon as one example. The evidence is available, as is the obvious corruption of priorities. Then, new revelations constrain a return to the question of why the cash-rich HEART Trust was removed from the Ministry of Education, but with almost a billion available for the Career Advancement Programme, trickled through to a myriad of institutions, many with little instructional capacity but with impeccable party connections. What about the self-respect of each of the boards of these \\u00adagencies? Should they remain? Inevitably, the mess at the Ministry of Education will slow down the vital process of educational transformation. The Government had already decided that major advances in education are not its priority for the next four years. Just look at the budget and the forward projections through to 2022. Who can now say when the Jamaica Teaching Council Bill will be brought into law? And who on the government bench, other than former minister Holness, can understand and then engineer this critical change of teacher accountability? Who is the strong, inspirational leader who will redress the situation Richard Azan, fruitlessly, put to Ruel Reid and solutionless bureaucrats at the Standing Finance Committee two weeks ago? One depopulated school in Azan\\u2019s constituency (and there are scores more like this elsewhere) has less than 100 pupils and nine teachers, who are tenured there and cannot be moved. But there is a nearby school bursting with over 1,000 pupils and lacking as many teachers as the other has oversupply. Nothing is being done to correct this. Such anomalies hurt innocent pupils. And this is but one instance, among many, immediately requiring trusted leadership; bold, concensus-building skills and strong powers of persuasion in an indifferent Cabinet and an \\u00aduninformed public. At a more than two-hour, \\u00adthorough interrogation of the ministry\\u2019s budget at the Standing Finance Committee, Michael Stewart and I deliberately never took on issues about the minister\\u2019s personal or political activity despite the many questions already in the public sphere. But how could it have been that other members of the governing party knew nothing and had no questions about the \\u00adeducation spend? And have we missed the trenchant comments about education and training \\u00adpriorities from the teaching \\u00adprofession, whose leadership, of late, had become so indistinguishably aligned to the then minister?

Professor Theodore Lewis I intend to characterise the global resurgence of interest and investment in pre-schools, under the general rubric ECCE (Early Childhood Care and Education), and to alert the populace, especially people of humble circumstances to seize every opportunity to send off their children off to pre-school at age three. I have a vivid recollection of my mother dropping me off at a pre-school downstairs of one of the planning buildings on Nelson Street at about age three, before heading to her stall in the George Street market. It was 1950-51. When my uncle who lived in Marabella adopted me at four, he continued the practice. I went to Miss Cross\\u2019 private school across the street. Along with her fighting spirit, that is all my mother who died in 1980 bequeathed to me. I thank her immensely for it. I thank my uncle, who died in 2002, for making my humble education his duty. My daughter went to the university pre-school at Wisconsin. When we returned home to T&T, she continued at Happy Vale Pre-School in Diamond Vale. My granddaughter Olivia, who is about to turn six, attended two pre-schools in Maryland before starting kindergarten. She cracked the reading code at four and is an avid, fluent reader. She attends a kindergarten run by the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Maryland. The teachers praise the children there at every turn and believe in their ability. All children can be fluent early readers and that skill is key to their later academic development. The key is that parents and guardians must be made aware of this and strive to enable it. Teachers must be virtuous, ethical and beyond reproach. This nonsense I heard in our pre-schools about not pushing small children too hard really is what they tell black people. Early education is the key for that poor child. Teach him to read early. That must be the primary purpose of our pre-schools. Children can get \\u201csocialisation\\u201d in the yard, with hop-scotch and bat and ball. That\\u2019s the co-curriculum. Teaching small children to read does not hurt or injure them. Get fun books, lots of books, and praise them at every turn. Read to them about the planets, the moon, crabs, iguanas, flamingoes, frogs, fishes, spiders, monkeys, going to the market. I make regular readings on all of these things and email to my daughter, for my granddaughter\\u2019s pleasure. The Internet is loaded with images, including cartoons, to support such readings. One hour after a giraffe is born it has to be running, because the lions are coming. Adult Chinese immigrants here are learning English through their very small children. I went to a Chinese restaurant a couple of years ago, and the mother sent her small son of about four to the counter to chat with me. The boy asked me if I had been to university. In clear English. He was the translator in that restaurant. He was attending pre-school. Across the globe there is now a raging new revolution in education focused on pre-school attendance. Countries are frantically placing resources and effort into creating ECCE centres where children can spend the two early years between ages three and five readying themselves for kindergarten. Economist and Nobel Laureate James Heckman has advocated such investment. In 2006 he wrote in an article titled \\u201cSkill formation and the economics of investing in disadvantaged children\\u201d in the journal Science that \\u201cInvesting in disadvantaged young children is a rare public policy initiative that promotes fairness and social justice and at the same time promotes productivity in the economy and in society at large.\\u201d He continued: \\u201cEarly interventions targeted toward disadvantaged children have much higher returns than interventions \\u2026such as ... convict rehabilitation programmes, or expenditure on police.\\u201d In other words, pre-school is a sounder economic and social intervention than Life Sport. Scholars Lori Irwin, Arjumand Siddiqi and Clyde Hertzman wrote a report for the World Health Organisation, titled \\u201cEarly Child Development: A Powerful Equaliser.\\u201d In it they said: \\u201cWhat children experience during the early years sets a critical foundation for their entire life course. This is because Early Childhood Development ...strongly influences basic learning, school success, economic participation, social citizenry, and health.\\u201d What should be taught in the pre-school? The answer to this lies in our understanding of the immense capability of children. Deanna McLennan says that the pre-school can prepare children for mathematics. They can explore shapes and learn to sort materials into bins at clean-up time. Brenneman and Louro say that we can teach pre-schoolers the sense of science. Where does the moon go? Where does water come from when rain falls? Children can explore the life of frogs. They can investigate ants and other insects. They can grow plants in the schoolyard. \\u2022 Prof Theodore Lewis chaired the Cabinet Committee on Elementary and Pre-School Education IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

Professor Theodore Lewis MANY aspects of this society proceed on the momentum of the past. Memory is stored in the civil service, or the teaching service. These do not change when governments change so past practices endure. But any society that has continuity as a default will find that it becomes intellectually atrophied. I went back to the campus at University of Minnesota late last year, the second time I had gone back since leaving there in 2008. I stayed in the campus hotel, and I found that when I went for breakfast no one was paying with cash. The students were just walking up to the cashier and producing their cell phones. Even my credit card felt like a relic. Washington Avenue on the fringes of the campus now accommodated not just vehicular traffic but light rail. These developed societies are premised on constant change. But we are a static society here, clinging to colonial memory, and because we are thus, we are a retrogressive society that invents nothing. My target here is education. And what do we have to show for our guiding logic here? We go to our oracle Sat Maharaj, our most influential educator, and he brings out The Concordat of 1960. But wasn\\u2019t that before independence? The current Minister on assuming his post promised that the Concordat would be left intact. Now Sat is on the radio, and they are complaining. What kind of cars were people driving in 1960 when the Concordat was made? Where I lived, we had a latrine at the back. Of all things in a society, education cannot be moribund. It is education, and the human capital it produces that moves you into the future. Education is responsible for the kinds of dynamism we see in the more recently developed societies, such as South Korea, China, Singapore, Japan. It is education that has pushed Finland into the limelight. Samsung, Kia, and Nokia are products of human ingenuity and progressive education systems. These brands were not around in 1960. When your education system remains parked in 1960, we should not be surprised that the society itself is parked there, and that someone returning here after 40 years abroad would find no trouble getting around. Nothing has changed. Had Patrick Manning not built those towers, our capital city would have remained stuck in the era of Jean and Dinah. There has been some talk recently about the SEA. The problem is that schools are sites of a proxy war. My child versus your child. You do not hear wholesome progressive talk about what schooling is about. The doors of the prized schools are closed to many. There is a famous image from the United Sates in the 1960s of some black children being escorted by federal marshals as they entered a school yard, with a menacing crowd surrounding them and jeering. We have that attitude here. In the anthem we say every creed and race finds and equal place. But when it comes to education, we have first choice and second choice. Some secondary schools offer chemistry. Most do not. Some offer A-Levels, most do not. So, we have an uneven school system that it takes no special training to see. Our primary schools hold a competition to determine which secondary schools children will attend. In Finland they say all schools must be good. No need for competition. Just pick one and send your child. In this country we say let\\u2019s keep the good schools scarce, and let the children battle on SEA day. So, if a child does not pass for a school that offers additional mathematics or chemistry at A-Level, it\\u2019s the child\\u2019s fault. But if you look at the SEA, you see that we do not examine science. If a subject is not examinable it will not be taken seriously by teachers. So science is not a high priority in our primary schools. But the private sector does not complain, because they don\\u2019t need scientifically literate workers. You do not need scientists for fried chicken and coffee. But science is an extremely high priority in the serious countries of the world. The TIMMS results in science for 2015 for children ages 9-10 show that 47 countries took part. Some 4,000 children from each country took the exam. The top seven countries and the average score of their children were as follows: 1. Singapore \\u2014 590; 2. South Korea \\u2014 589; 3. Japan \\u2014 569; 4. Russian Federation \\u2014 567; 5 Hong Kong \\u2014 557; 6. Taiwan \\u2014 555; 7. Finland \\u2014 554. Other countries of interest here were United States \\u2014 546; England \\u2014 536; and Canada \\u2014 525. This is academic Olympics. And you see Finland at number 7 in the world. We are not there, because science is not offered at competitive level here. We can\\u2019t even be in the competition. But having science in the elementary school is a reason why Koreans could make Samsung phones, and the Finnish could make Nokia. We are known for the volume of fried chicken they buy on the Lara promenade. In England they have long abandoned the eleven-plus selection examination. They had up to 1300 grammar schools in the mid-1960\\u2019s now there are 163. They have multiple ways in which a child can do A-Levels. They don\\u2019t keep high-value subjects scarce and hidden away in a corner like we do here. In England they have national tests at each stage of schooling. But quite different from us the results are used to judge not just the progress of children but the quality of schools. Schools pay a price if their children do poorly. The results are made publicly available online, in so-called league tables. Here, the Minister does not see that the public must know how each school performed. Show us how School \\u201cA\\u201d did in mathematics. The Ministry suppresses the school scores, thereby shielding the many bad schools we have, especially in urban areas, from public view. We shame the children only. The SEA results should show how each school performed on the subjects offered in the exam.

Leela Ramdeen A just society is inclusive. Years ago, the late Prof John Spence, who established T&T\\u2019s Education Discussion Group, of which I was chair for a number of years, said: \\u201cIf indeed education is better in denominational schools, then we must ensure that government schools are brought up to the best level.\\u201d It is no use telling parents that they are the ones to blame for placing \\u201cstress\\u201d on the shoulders of their children writing the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) exam, when they know that there is no level playing field in our education system. While the SEA is a placement exam, used to place students in secondary schools based on their abilities, parents, in particular, worry that if their children do not score sufficient marks to be placed in a school of their first choice, which is quite often a so-called \\u201cprestige\\u201d school, they may end up in a school where the quality of education leaves much to be desired. Education is a partnership between parent, school, and community. We must do more to strengthen this partnership; to create conditions/places of high quality teaching and learning that will allow each child to realise his/her potential. Pope Francis stated: \\u201cEducation cannot be neutral. It is either positive or negative; either it enriches or it impoverishes; either it enables a person to grow or it lessens, even corrupts him/her\\u201d. In 2014, the US Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, rightly stated: \\u201cEducation is the great equaliser\\u2014it should be used to level the playing field, not to grow inequality.\\u201d Is our education system enabling our children to grow; to be the best that they can be; to prepare them for life? Are we doing enough to level the playing field so that all students have access to quality education? Catholic social teaching speaks about the principle of \\u201cintegral human development\\u201d, that is, the development of every dimension of a person (intellectual, physical, spiritual, emotional, social) and of every person. Development has to be person-centred if we are to achieve our nation\\u2019s goals. Year after year we go through the same story with the SEA\\u2014euphoria for some and misery for many. Last year 2,595 students scored less than 30 per cent in the SEA. The Minister of Education and the ministry\\u2019s chief education officer stated on CNC3 that about 32 pupils less than last year\\u2019s figure scored less than 30 per cent. This means that 2,565 scored less than 30 per cent this year. Those who score under 30 per cent and are under 13 years old are not placed in secondary schools and some will repeat a year. The revised syllabus contains a new assessment framework that was distributed to schools in 2017. Teachers were trained and students had 2 years to prepare for the exam which seeks to test e.g. their creative/reasoning/ critical thinking/ problem solving skills. Was this sufficient time to move from rote learning and regurgitating information to learn about/practice critical thinking which is an essential life skill? Michigan State University Extension shares tips on helping children learn and practice critical thinking e.g. encourage pursuits of curiosity, learn from others, help children evaluate information, promote children\\u2019s interest, and teach problem-solving skills. We should introduce this life skill early in a child\\u2019s school life. This requires our schools to consider whether the teaching and learning processes as they currently exist, will facilitate the development of this skill in our students. On another point, were you as disturbed as I was by the information shared at the recent sitting of Parliament\\u2019s Joint Select Committee on Human Rights? Of the 3,735 school students who have special needs, only 1,756 of these have been referred to the Ministry of Education\\u2019s Student Support Services Division. CEO, Harrilal Seecharan, said many pupils are diagnosed late. Imagine, some pupils have waited up to nine years to be assessed before applying for SEA concessions. Three hundred students got special concessions. Let\\u2019s hope that the plan to ensure that screening takes place from the point of the early childhood education centres and in primary schools becomes a reality soon. I believe in inclusive education and that special needs children should be in mainstream schools, but it is essential that adequate support is given to teachers to cater for their needs. OJTs alone will not cut it! And it is scandalous that since March 2018 special needs pupils are still waiting for their grants. Time for the new type of grant to be distributed.

Karim was piloting a motion in the House of Representatives in Port of Spain calling for the condemnation of this Government for \\u201cits gross failure in the education sector and the resultant detrimental effect on generations of children\\u201d. Chief among Garcia\\u2019s alleged misdeeds was the fact that he denied more than 70,000 first formers the opportunity to receive a laptop, denying the country\\u2019s youth one of the platforms for becoming competitive, the Chaguanas East MP stated. Karim said Garcia had talked about e-books. \\u201cWhere are the e-books, how many have you introduced into the schools? We should be moving to e-learning and m (mobile) learning,\\u201d Karim said. He said at a time when the world was moving towards the Internet and artificial intelligence, this Government was giving no thought to training and development of teachers so that they can be computer proficient in the classroom. Under the People\\u2019s National Movement (PNM), Government had reduced the expenditure on GATE from $750 million to $435 million and had reduced scholarships to form six students from 470 recipients in 2014 under the People\\u2019s Partnership to 376 under this administration, said Karim. \\u201cIf you want to take care of the best and brightest, you would not be doing this,\\u201d he noted. Among this PNM Government\\u2019s sins were the non-completion of the Penal/Debe campus for four years; keeping the Tamana campus of the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) closed for four years; the keeping of 19 primary schools, including Belmont RC, from opening and the keeping of 37 ECCE (Early Childhood and Care) centres closed, Karim said. \\u2018Overgrown by bushes\\u2019 \\u201cThe PNM loves to ask where are all the schools that the People\\u2019s Partnership government built. I will tell you where they are\\u2014overgrown by bushes because you abandoned them. I have to look at my television and see cows eating grass at the Ramai Hindu School,\\u201d he stated. Karim said the PNM Government had closed the NESC (National Energy Skills Centre), depriving people in South and Central of opportunities. The Chaguanas East MP said the PNM Government invested in keeping people powerless. They did not want an educated population because educated people ask questions, were not easily fooled and didn\\u2019t fall for fake news. He said over $21 billion was spent on the Ministry of Education over the last four years, but the only school this Government completed was Scarborough RC. \\u201cAbsolutely nothing has been done for children of special needs. There are no schools that cater for children on the autistic spectrum. There are major training gaps among educators in special needs education. There is no financial support for the therapy required by special needs children,\\u201d Karim said. He said in the face of all of this, Government members were laughing. Karim also stated publishers were owed millions of dollars and for the first time, they (publishers) were required to pay a fee for the evaluation of textbooks. He said maxi-taxi school providers had to beg for their just due, and 4,000 meals were cut from the school feeding programme. He said the learning enhancement centres meant for pupils who are suspended to be given remedial education were not functioning properly.

Some parents were on their knees crying, hands outstretched, imploring, begging the relevant minister to have pity on them, give them a chance, bestow on them, it seems, a great gift\\u2014the opportunity to go to school. No, this was not in some impoverished part of Africa, or India. It was not our neighbour Haiti, often dismiss as voodoo cursed. This was our own dear wannabe first world status country of Trinidad and Tobago. Is it only me that is embarrassed and enraged at scenes like these in sweet T&T These scenes are little different to those which show us, weekly, daily, the trials and tribulations of sick people who do not have adequate access to our publicly funded hospitals, who, when they are lucky enough to get a bed, cannot get drugs, or effective drugs, or see the doctor and any one of the myriad of problems that plague our health sector. From all of the various reports, I have heard very little or nothing that we are in fact, speaking about rights. Yes, indeed, rights, not privileges, or handouts from some benevolent state. Such rights invoke legal obligations on the part of the state. Note, I said, the state and not the Government, or any partisan political arrangement. The State is a neutralised concept which goes beyond particular administrations and political timeframes. Human Rights thought has long gone past the limitation that the subject of rights only involves what we call civil and political rights, that is, the right to life, to expression, movement etc. Rather, the more recent understanding of rights is that they also involve what we call economic, social and cultural rights, namely, the rights to education, to health, to work, the environment and to culture. Significantly, we have moved away from the self-imposed limitation that economic, social and cultural rights are merely unenforceable ideals. Rather, the international community now accepts that these kinds of bread and butter rights are just as vital, and in some ways more directly important, to the central dignity and equality of mankind. Accordingly, international conventions and protocols have been signed and developed to ensure that they have tangible and concrete meaning. Ultimately, what this means, is that states now have direct legal obligations to promote and protect such rights. The OAS, for example, has promulgated the San Salvador Protocol, which focusses specifically on making such rights enforceable and specific indicators, on education, health, work etc. have been developed to measure how states perform in this regard. We are part of the OAS community. This complements already existing obligations under the UN and the American Convention. The bottom line is that we can no longer turn a blind eye to the state's duties to promote, provide and protect rights to education, to health, to work, to culture and to the environment. Notably, this jurisprudence calls on states to \\u201cprogressively realise\\u201d these rights. What this also means is that a state cannot regress or go backward in their provision. What does this say therefore, about our long-standing commitments to universal education, including tertiary education, universal health care when we see these dire situations of the marginalised Rights in the work sphere\\u2014to work, to adequate wages, to earned benefits, to decent working conditions, continue to be problematic. Under the rubric of \\u201cwork'', we include rights to social security. The arrangements that we make, or do not make for our citizens when they are laid off, or cannot obtain employment, or are unable to work, , are therefore pertinent here, whether it be unemployment insurance, which I have long advocated, or a simple food card to an unemployed person or the elderly. Similarly, our casual disregard of 'ratty' workplaces and termination benefits that escape all legal obligations, or denying GATE funding to persons above 50. We have become so insensitised to suffering, so unaware of and cynical about our place in the world that on the night that the story of the kneeling parents was aired, the people meter question was whether it was \\u201cpolitically motivated\\u201d, as if ethnicity, when thrown into the mix, should make any difference to our entitlements and rights as citizens of this nation that we say that we want to build.

To ensure that all money available for teaching our children is actually spent where it should (building schools, paying teachers and buying textbooks), the Ministry of Education should implement such anti-corruption basics as access to information on education policy, codes of conduct for educators, parent and student participation in governance, and clear systems of oversight and accountability across the education spectrum as issues that this country needs to deal with, in order to stop corruption in the education system. The release added the results of the comprehensive investigation into corruption in education sheds light on the many shapes and forms of corrupt practices in education, from the embezzle- ment of national education funds, hidden school costs, to the buying and selling of fake degrees. The report provides analysis and recommendations from over 70 experts in more than 50 countries on global trends in corruption in education, understanding the scale of corruption in school education, transparency and integrity in higher education, innovative approaches to tackling corruption in education. The results demonstrate that if we ramp up the fight against corruption in education, more children will stay in school and meet literacy and development goals. It will prepare the next generation to say no to corruption. The report also details numerous practical steps to prevent the abuse of power, bribery and secret dealings from corroding the education-al experience.

From the musings of the ancient Greek philosophers, to the enlightenment to the current information age, education is both invaluable and some might now say a right. From being the domain of a few sons of privilege in the Middle Ages, education is now seen as being as basic as shelter and sustenance in the modern world. The very nature of education has been altered through the years but the basic premise of education has remained constant, that is preparing students for life. The idea or concept of education is not to simply learn and regurgitate facts and figures. Rather, it is to apply and interpret existing knowledge to both exist in and add to the world, whilst securing one's own interests. Education is, then, an individualistic experience though it is taught to the collective. It is on this issue that I take umbrage with the current Secondary Education Assessment (SEA) system and the transition from primary to secondary school. The simple fact is that in the name of having good statistics and the illusion of \\\"all passes\\\" or \\\"no child left behind\\\" our children are being sacrificed. Many may take offence to this but the proof is there for all and sundry to see. The placing into secondary school of students who have performed below average in the SEA is a mistake of epic proportions that will haunt our nation for decades to come. The nature of education is to prepare students for the world. Not all students are academically inclined and this again is another cold, hard fact that many may find most upsetting. Once again the proof of this is quite glaringly obvious from the performance statistics of SEA. These students may, for a myriad of reasons including nerves, fright, poor nutrition, dyslexia etc, perform below expectation and instead of ascertaining the causes of their issues they are thrown from one rigorous academic environment into another. Some of these students can be put back on track with remedial help and special attention, but many others will flourish and perform admirably if they are allowed to study a trade or vocational skill. Whilst some people may be good with numbers or theory others are wizards with computers, labs and practical work. The pursuit of vocational training including electrical installation, mechanics, sewing, tailoring, woodwork, glassmaking, plumbing etc, may also appeal to students who have performed well at SEA but are not interested in pursuing academics. These are skills that students can use to build a life and a future. They are career skills that contribute to the economy and are always in demand. They are skills that form the basis of many entrepreneurs and small businesses which are the backbone of many developed nations. However, instead of recognising that some students need our help and need support to do what they enjoy, they are placed in classrooms where they are shamed and made to feel inferior. Students who can be phenomenal mechanics are made to sit through lessons in literature or history and very often are the point of ridicule from classmates and even worse, from frustrated and uncaring teachers. Being ostracised in secondary school is a soul-crushing experience and many students, instead of facing the daily teasing and abuse, will elect to drop out of school or fall into the wrong company. Either way they will end up out of school without any skills whatsoever, without qualifications and with grim employment prospects. Some may find work in the manual labour sector but those without hope will turn to crime and the very society that abandoned them will be made to pay the price for its callousness. This is a very grave picture and many may say it leans too heavily on the side of pessimism but the simple fact is that there seems to be a disconnect between reality and ideas in the ministries in Trinidad and Tobago. Most of them are operating counter to reality and thus instead of helping are hindering our development. Children and students need help; they need to be empowered to make use of those skills and assets they possess. No one is advocating to send out students who are unable to read or write. Yes, basic numerical, written and communication skills need to be learned but they can be incorporated into the syllabus of trade schools. Vocational and technical college education should be available free of charge to interested SEA students and along with their chosen technical course they can be schooled in basic mathematics, language arts, communication, accounting etc. The opportunity to study at university level through UTT or other programmes should also exist for interested students. The courses offered at these schools should be in demand and partnerships with industry firms can help to provide real world expertise with the possibility of placement thereafter. These schools should be given the same priority, support and respect as academic institutions as both sets of skills are intertwined. The software technician cannot do any programming without a working computer, neither can the doctor get to work without a properly functioning car. There is no shame if one's daughter wants to be a mechanic or if one's son wants to be a cake artist. Whilst many, if not most, parents have dreams of PhDs and ties and stockings for their children, at the end of the day it is crucial to remember that it is their life. If they are able to pursue a skill and make an honest and often profitable living, then as parents and a society it is up to us to support them. It is high time serious thought be given to the current SEA system, as it has proven to be a broken system in need of massive overhaul.

These are the findings of a newly published report by a team of experts from the Trinidad and Tobago Health Sciences Initiative, a collaboration among Johns Hopkins Medicine, The University of Trinidad and Tobago and the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Health, among other institutions, which aims to improve population health in that country through education and research. The study was conducted on behalf of the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee, the ministry of education and the ministry of health. The results, the research team says, underscore the urgent need to make childhood obesity a top national priority. The experts recommend a swift analysis that quantifies the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity on a national scale, followed by the development of relevant strategies to prevent and reverse the condition in youngsters affected by it. These are decidedly sobering findings that highlight a critical need to reverse a trend that, if uncorrected, can have far-reaching consequences for the health of this nation, says Felicia Hill-Briggs, Ph.D., senior author on the report, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the director of diabetes research for the Trinidad and Tobago Health Sciences Initiative. A growing body of evidence shows that many chronic conditions typically deemed adult are, in fact, rooted in childhood, the experts say. Obesity is believed to fuel a range of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders and even some cancers. In addition, early weight problems can speed up the onset of disease at a younger age. For example, type 2 diabetes, which was virtually unseen in children 20 years ago, is now increasingly diagnosed in teens and younger children, a trend fueled by growing childhood obesity, scientists believe. In addition to immeasurable human suffering, the experts note, obesity-fueled disease can cause a serious financial drain on a nations health care system to the tune of billions of dollars. Fortunately, the researchers say, there are a variety of lifestyle and behavior-modification programs that have proven successful in the treatment of childhood overweight and obesity. We have a wide range of interventions, and the time to act is now, before the trend reaches a tipping point, says report co-author Larry Romany, M.S., former president of the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee. The analysis, based on data collected in 2012, involved more than 3,300 children, ages 5 through 12, from 14 primary schools in the Point Fortin and Mayaro regions of the country. Less than two-thirds of children had normal body mass index. More than one-fifth were overweight or obese, while 13 percent of youngsters were underweight, the study showed. The relatively high proportion of underweight children is another alarming finding, the experts say, highlighting the range of pathologies stemming from poor nutrition. Children in standard 5, or 12 to 13-year-olds, on average, had the highest body-mass index, a finding suggesting that weight troubles that start in early childhood are generally progressive and difficult to reverse, the research team says. The researchers say that even though the results come from data collected from two southern regions of the country, the findings may very well reflect a national trend. Nearly three-quarters of deaths among Trinidadian men stem from chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and respiratory ailments, according to estimates from the World Health Organization published in 2004. Such conditions claim the lives of more than 80 percent of women in Trinidad and Tobago, according to the World Health Organization. Co-investigators on the report included Mariana Lazo, M.D., Ph.D., Sc.M., and Gary Gerstenblith, M.D., both of Johns Hopkins. The other co-authors on the study were Troy Romany, former director of the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee Shape the Community Programme; and Andrew Dhanoo, B.Sc., of the University of the West Indies and a research assistant for the Trinidad and Tobago Health Sciences Initiative.

The Human Resource Development Commission was launched recently with the main purpose of developing an Education Human Resource Development 2030 Strategy. The intent of the Plan is to ensure that the systems operating at all levels \\u2013 national, sub-regional and regional \\u2013 are developing the skills graduates need to function effectively in a 21st Century economy and society. While this statement seems an obvious approach to refining and strengthening the education systems in the region, developing an agreed approach and time-bound action plan meeting the needs and priorities of the education systems in CARICOM will not be as simple as making an announcement that it intends to do so. The CARICOM States' education systems are a Rubik's cube of elements that all have to interact in harmony to produce change. Just as solving a Rubik's cube requires the alignment of all cubes of the same colour on a single side of the larger cube so that each side of the cube displays a different colour, so alignment of all of the elements of all of the education systems will be necessary to formulate a Strategic Plan for Caribbean education that will actually effect change in the system. First, before listing the challenges, one needs to acknowledge that this new Plan will be constructed on the foundation of existing collaborative successes across the Caribbean. There are achievements of which member and Associate States can be justly proud: achieving almost universal primary education and boasting an average schooling level of 10.3 in most States; collaborating on regional examination and certification systems of CXC, CAPE and CANTA, and increasing tertiary educational opportunities in the region through improved college programmes and an expanded University of the West Indies. By establishing the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), opportunities for the best and brightest of graduates appear to be increasing, and the necessity to travel out of the region for a good education and a good job after graduation should be diminishing. However, when one looks closer to home \\u2013 at the individual cubes that comprise the whole Rubik's cube \\u2013 the education picture seems less positive. The cubes align, but they aren't the same colour. And just as originally there was a belief that the Rubik's cube was unsolvable, there are now competitions to see how fast competitors can solve it. Just as Rubik's cube can be solved, so can the puzzle of component parts that form the Caribbean public education system. This article, which is the first in a series addressing the challenges confronting the Caribbean education system that the Regional Strategic Action Plan must address, identifies the challenges presented by a phenomenon that is uppermost in many parents' and students' minds at this time of the year: how to successfully survive the stress of the regional examination systems. The education of its citizenry is the bedrock of national development in any country. There is no question that the existing education systems in the region have identified, nurtured and graduated a wealth of bright and capable minds that have served both the region and many developed countries well. However, these successes constitute a small percentage of the Caribbean citizenry \\u2013 people of considerable talent and achievement who, by emigrating, denied their talents to their own countries. Admittedly, some of the best and brightest returned or remained at home and continued to serve the development needs of their countries, but they still are a small percentage of their age cohorts. For many, school was something at which they couldn't or weren't allowed to succeed because of the very nature and structure of the test-based system. And those school experiences, of success or its absence, have affected the rate of development in the region, as well of the lives of those who passed through the system. Of particular note are those who weren't deemed to be successful, who the system labelled as failures as early as age 10. A few years ago, the valedictorian at a well-respected Ontario university began her address by saying, \\u201cWhen you go home, I want all of the people in the audience who are here from [the name of the country where she was born and raised until she was 10] to tell the Ministry of Education that it is possible to be a success even if one fails the Common Entrance.\\u201d It is worth noting that even a decade later, this young woman's first concern was to show that she had succeeded even though she \\u201cfailed\\u201d the Common Entrance examination At this time in the school year here in Jamaica, parents and students are suffering under the exigencies of the19th Century Industrial Age exam-driven education system that the British bequeathed to the countries of the region as part of their colonial legacy. In the 19th Century, the point of the education system was to inculcate obedience in students, so that they could assume industrial jobs on a factory floor. These jobs are very few in the 21st Century and their numbers continue to shrink. Ironically, in Britain, on which many of the Caribbean countries have modelled their educational systems, the importance of high stakes academic testing like the Common Entrance and the \\u201cO\\u201d and \\u201cA\\u201d Level examinations has diminished significantly, and routine articulation between technical and academic education streams has been established, especially with the increasing popularity of adult education and the need for further education building on acquired skills. It seems to be much more difficult to bridge the divide between academic and TVET education in CARICOM countries. Parents anguish over the exams their children have to write to \\u201csucceed\\u201d at almost all levels of schooling \\u2013 in Grade 1 when they enter school, at Grade 3 to see their progress in Math and English, in Grade 4 to see whether they are literate enough to proceed to Grade 5, and the exit exam in Grade 6. Because school placements at secondary level in Jamaica are based on achievement at the end of primary school, their children's ability to be accepted in a \\u201cgood\\u201d high or secondary school depends on scores on the Grade Six Achievement Test (rather than where the students live), the successor to the British-designed Common Entrance Examination that was long the hallmark of school achievement in primary school; \\u201csuccess\\u201d at the end of high or secondary school depends on scores achieved in CXC and CAPE examinations, the successors of the British \\u201cO\\u201d and \\u201cA\\u201d Level examinations. Admission to tertiary institutions, whether colleges or universities, depends on the quality of passes at CXC and CAPE. Parents are investing in extra lessons (if they can afford them) to try to ensure their children's success in these examinations, and teachers are augmenting their incomes with extra lesson monies. Indeed, the more entrepreneurial among their numbers are setting up private businesses in extra lessons (especially Mathematics) to feed the angst of parents who worry about their children's futures if they don't get high scores on the national and regional examinations. And, indeed, their worries are justified: even after years of struggle to improve Mathematics and English Language scores in CXC examinations \\u2013 the two required subjects for tertiary level entry \\u2013 the percentage of passes is still abysmally low. While the extra lessons syndrome might not seem to extend to technical schools, those students enrolled in TVET programmes also are infected by the testing bug, since graduates must be certified through Jamaica National Vocational Qualifications (J-NVQs) or Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQs) to gain employment beyond their own borders under the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME). Since many students were advised to enrol in technical programmes because they were not successful in the high stakes academic tests at the end of primary school or early in secondary school, the entire TVET system suffers from the perception that its students are not as \\u201csmart\\u201d as academic students. Although this perception, constructed as it is on the outdated idea that academic students are \\u201cbrighter\\u201d than TVET students, is wrong, it is still widely held among parents and the general public. It is interesting to note that in Ontario, where community colleges were established 40 years ago to allow those who were considered less academically gifted the opportunity to get a tertiary degree, more than 30 percent of university graduates are now re-enrolling in a community college programme to acquire a skill that will make them employable. The Caribbean is far behind the curve. Educationists and employers alike have asserted that what students need to learn in school is broader than the memorisation of facts and their accurate regurgitation on an examination: employers in particular have said that they want graduates and employees who can solve problems, think critically, listen analytically, act independently, and express themselves accurately in speech and writing. However, the test-driven education system is unlikely to create students who demonstrate these skills, since it places high value on those teachers who can produce large numbers of students who can respond accurately to content-driven examination questions, and the means of getting students to pass examinations is to teach them how to write those kinds of exams. The CXC has been struggling with the contradiction between the demands of an Industrial Age education system and the employers' demands for a graduate from CSEC and CAPE with other skills by increasing the value of school-based assessments at the secondary levels, but the exams still feature heavily in calculating a student's grades. Region-wide adoption of the new CXC Grade 6 examination that encourages problem solving and student involvement in their own learning has been slow. Instead of adopting this Grade 6 examination, Jamaica is developing a news standards-based curriculum for Grades 1 to 9 and revising the approaches in its Grade 6 examination. Changing testing and measuring student success also has implications for establishing international assessment strategies not dependent upon examinations alone, changing the curriculum for pre-service teacher training, changing teacher certification and professional development, strengthening the training of teacher educators and educational administrators, and conducting dialogues with parents and employers. Planning change of such deep-rooted systems poses a considerable challenge. Thus, while Caribbean countries may have gained political independence, they have not yet managed educational independence. The areas of curriculum design, classroom instruction and testing are just a few of the areas the CARICOM Education and Human Resource 2030 Strategy and Action Plan will have to address, and constitute but one cube on one face of the Rubik's cube of the Caribbean education system. *Nancy A.

The resolution, which T&T supported, set out 17 development goals and 169 targets, all of which came into effect on January 1 this year. Goal 4 reads: \\u201cEnsure\\u201d \\u2013 that word again \\u2013 \\u201cinclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\\u201d (The phrase \\u201cquality education\\u201d seems endemic in certain circles.) One of the targets of that goal is, by 2030, to \\u201censure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university.\\u201d Lifelong learning. Equal access for all. You may say that 2030 is a long way off. It isn't; not in education matters. On October 7 Minister Garcia raised a number of issues very important to our education system, among them parenting and violence and indiscipline. But these issues, linked inter alia to rising crime, are also of national concern. The UWI and UTT sociologists have a crucial research role to play in this regard (Ramesh Deosaran has been doing more than his fair share). What kind of society are we Why How do we go about improving it Minister Franklin Khan had previously talked about a dress code for teachers; I recall him saying that when he was a schoolboy his (male) teachers all wore ties. That was not my experience at QRC, in the age of colonialism. Some teachers wore suits and ties; some wore short sleeves, ties and trousers; some wore short pants, tall socks and no ties. One, a little Irishman, wore short pants, no tie and no underpants. His private parts were plainly visible when he sat in front of the class. They didn't amount to much, and caused great merriment. He was soon shipped out, I suspect for having inflicted grievous genital embarrassment on the British Empire. Dress codes may have their place, but, like on-time school openings, they are hardly the spearhead of educational effort. In its Newsday column of last December 29, TTUTA said that education \\u201cmust not only be about the acquisition of skills, knowledge and competencies, but also about the values of respect for life and human dignity\\u2026(E)ducation (must be) based on a sound ethical foundation (which) embraces a set of universal principles of humanity.\\u201d TTUTA continued: \\u201c(We have) to shift the focus from measurement of learning to more holistic frameworks that go beyond the traditional domains of academic learning.\\u201d Then a warning: \\u201cThis will not happen if we continue\\u2026to be obsessed with examinations\\u2026designed for the sole purpose of exclusion and the perpetuation of a class differential. We cannot continue to equate education with the 'passing' of cognitive-based exams, but rather see education from a much broader perspective\\u2026\\u201d (My emphasis.) Which is where I started four columns ago. I then mentioned Finland and certain East Asian countries as places from which we could learn. There is however another Asian country that shares our problem: India. The following quotation comes from an article in The Hindu, a South India daily, of last June 6. Agreeing with, but going beyond, TTUTA, it says: \\u201cLearning to know is quite different from learning merely to pass examinations. In learning to know, 'how to think' is more important than 'what to think'. The bane of the current practice of schooling\\u2026is that students are not taught the art and science of thinking (My emphasis)...(I)t is doubtful if we are educating children or merely training them for the proverbial rat-race.\\u201d Substitute T&T for India. We go on and on about \\u201cdiversification\\u201d and \\u201cinnovation\\u201d and the rest, appearing not to understand that to achieve those very desirable goals we must have an education system which focuses on \\u201cmore holistic frameworks\\u2026\\u201d Instead, we tinker; we do not overhaul. And we must teach \\u201cthe art and science of thinking.\\u201d Creative, critical thinking. Which means a different kind of teacher training. Several years ago The UWI established an Institute of Critical Thinking; Dr Bhoe Tewarie was its first Director. Perhaps he and the current Director could share their experiences with the population. (This isn't a matter of politics, but of nation-building.) The Institute's website states that \\u201c(b)rains are biological. Minds are created\\u2026Education should seek to prepare learners for self-direction and not pre-conceived roles\\u2026Careful analysis, clear thinking and reasoned deliberation are fundamental to democracy and democratic life.\\u201d And also to socio-economic progress. Now, my brief return to article-writing ends, and once again I say au revoir. Parts 1-3 were published on October 19, 25 and 31 respectively. THE WRITER is a retired ambassador and former head of the public service Reginald Dumas IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months.

She told delegates, mainly from teachers colleges across the region to the University of the West Indies (UWI) and the United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) organised workshop, that teachers are facing increasing challenges in the area of discipline management. The director of the UWI School of Education, Dr. Babalola Ogunkola, said poor performances are largely attributed to the environment in whciuh learning takes place. \\u201cIn most countries, it is generally by means of an entrance examination or tests at the age 11 to 12 years which focuses principally on mathematics, language arts and social studies, despite the fact that approximately 30 per cent of the students taking these tests have not acquired the basic competences to perform at secondary level, they are still all assigned to secondary schools,\\u201d the Senior Lecturer in Science Education and Evaluation added.

I asked him what drives his peers, the young educated class in this country. His thoughtful response was they were concerned mainly with their own material progress and pursuit of pleasure, with no passion for country and society, confirming the view that, among our new educated elite, is an alarming deficit in social conscience, an inner vacancy. They look on at the society from a distance as something unreal, theatre, unrelated to their narrow preoccupations. They are not to be blamed. It is their education for which we have paid with great billions over the years. My young friend agrees if you spend 17 years passing through our primary and secondary schools and there is no stimulation of the soul, you should not expect anything more than limited, superficial engagement of the society by the new professional class in the country. We are therefore paying to place our nation in danger, for if our future leaders and elders don't care, what does the future hold for Trinidad and Tobago but more leaderlessness and rapaciousness This is a serious national challenge that we have not even begun to think about. We must understand how this developed, because it was not so with the pre- and post-Independence generations who were characterised by passion, if not clarity. But around 40 years ago, somewhere in the '70s, there was a global shift in education from the heroic to the pragmatic. Greater emphasis was placed on brain power than on developing the mind; on achieving earning capability than on nurturing sensitivity, social conscience and humanity. English literature and history were pushed to the periphery, for example, and math and sciences gained pre-eminence. How else could you prepare youth for the marketplace was the thinking then and now. So the brightest have continued to choose law, medicine, finance, engineering, accountancy; the pragmatic and practical. Fine, but generations of these have entered the professions with little of the shaping influence of the humanities. We ought to have maintained the critical balance in our schools. We failed and the world has seen the dehumanisation of hundreds of millions of young, bright people, among whom were those, greedy self-seeking financial wizards of Wall Street who, in pursuit for their enormous, ill-gotten gains, brought the world to the brink of economic ruin in 2008. The shift in education either coincided with or was the result of the market fundamentalism that drove the globalisation of production and the liberalisation of trade, reducing the role of the state, emphasising private sector-led growth, creating an environment where, more than ever, the attainment of wealth and status was the principal driving force for young people graduating from colleges and universities. If the world is today more materialistic than ever, then that shift has made the most significant contribution. The shift in education also produced a marked decline in the quality of leadership everywhere. Reagan, Thatcher, Pope John Paul, Lech Walesa and Gorbachev lingered into the modern era but were the products of a different education, a different time, as were Eric Williams, Cheddi Jagan, Errol Barrow and Michael Manley. All these were the last of the devoted breed, the larger than life characters, driven by more than hunger for power and prestige and grappling with their societies in very profound ways. After them came the ordinary, epitomised by the likes of Tony Blair, George W Bush and those in the region today who lack the conviction to lift Caricom from its stagnation. No leader now on the world stage can stir the heart of humanity as Winston Churchill, John F Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson whose landmark speech is 50 years old this week in which he said the \\\"Great Society\\\" must be built in the classrooms where \\\"every young mind is set free to scan the farthest reaches of thought and imagination... where every child can enrich his mind and enlarge his talents\\\". The barrenness of modern education is a major reason for a prevailing amorality among the upper echelons in Trinidad and Tobago. When wealth acquisition is the main preoccupation of those at the top, scruples are thrown out the window in every sector and predators prowl in offices and boardrooms everywhere, creating a jungle of lawlessness at the top which is already breeding violence of the kind that downed Dana. We must take action. I suppose we must count as largely lost those already too steeped in self and we must hope to eventually develop strength of law and institutions to protect the nation from disembowelment by those it spent billions to educate. But we must focus on the children and youth, those now moving through the education system which is more like an assembly line when it should be an open field for exploration of a variety of offerings, from arts and humanities to science and mathematics. Our education system has been producing academically successful youth who score low in caring and commitment to country. This is threat to the nation's future.

He was speaking at a function hosted by President Anthony Carmona and his wife, Reema Carmona, at Queens Hall, St Anns. Frederick was joined by his wife, Simone; children, Kirie, eight, and Wayne, 11; 91-year-old grandmother Christine Roach; mother, Frances Tyson-Hill; and specially invited guest/former national footballer Shaka Hislop, whom he described as a best friend.Frederick was also celebrating his 44th birthday and Reema Carmo- na had a cake done for the occasion. Frederick is also renowned as a scholar, researcher, administrator, humanitarian and surgical oncologist. Frederick was born in Diamond Vale, Diego Martin, and studied at Diego Martin Government Primary School and St Marys College. He studied medicine at Howard University. Credit to mom, grandmom Frederick said: My grandmother (Roach) was the first person in my life who instilled confidence. My mother (Tyson-Hill) did give me books and surgical masks. She emphasised education. She fell in love with Dr Williams. She was a big fan of his. My children are in middle school. Dr Williams created a public education system. She wanted me to get that type of education so I could have the type of life she envisioned for me. I have to give much credit to her. I was afforded a public education. My two childrens tuition is costing me ten times what I would have paid for my three degrees. Let us not forget Dr Williams and the intervention in education and the public health sector. It is free. The quality is excellent.He added: Dr Williams was a professor at Howard University. It was another reason why my mother and I became enamoured with Howard University as well. Frederick also invited citizens to be obsessed about Trinidad and Tobago. He said: Love is most important. This is a beautiful country. I vow to return the debt by my deeds and the quality of my deeds. Although we may be going through difficult times, let us take a moment to reflect. We are a melting pot of the worlds peoples. Let us never allow the differences to divide us but to bring us together.He also said his children had developed a certain measure of compassion for the homeless and the less fortunate.Humble and outstanding The gifts we have can only be worthwhile if we share them with the less fortunate. Carmona, who has just returned from South Africa, described Frederick as humble and outstanding. He reminisced on the days of Intercol when he was a pupil at Presentation College, San Fernando. Carmona also expressed his pride in Hislops accomplishments by saying whenever he looks at ESPN, he often remarked, I know him. Commenting on Fredericks appointment, Carmona said: It was about selfless service. We have to celebrate it.

The school, which is on the Eastern Main Road, St Joseph, is a privately-owned institution and has about 210 pupils. Ali said the school has been absorbing losses after the board was unable to earn enough to match its $65,000-a-month expenditure bill and it had reached a point where they could no longer sustain the institution. So after two years of doing this, Ali said they were forced to meet Education Minister Esther Le Gendre to discuss a solution. At the meeting they were told that their contract between the ministry and themselves did not allow them to shut down the school and if they wanted to close it down they would need to submit the necessary documents one year in advance. \\\"Right now, we basically have until the end of the school year and we intend to do a number of reviews in light of the circumstances,\\\" he said. Asked if that meant letting go some of the teachers, Ali said they already had a high turnover even though they were always able to keep teachers with an A'Levels certificate. \\\"The cost of paying university graduate teachers is really high...it's easier for the government run schools to pay the high wages, but we can't,\\\" he said.

I actually agree with most of the proposed changes and I think it is high time primary school pupils are relieved of the tremendous pressure placed on them. That being said I was most distressed that the honourable minister also took a swipe at the so-called \\\"prestige\\\" or denominational schools. The minister was quoted as saying that these schools need to stop taking the best students. Now I do not know if I am the only one who is a bit confused here but what exactly does the minister mean Before I proceed further I must state that I attended one of the so-called \\\"prestige\\\" schools: Presentation College, Chaguanas. Some will say that I am biased. But I came from a family and area where the vast majority of my relatives, friends and neighbours went to comprehensive and other non-denominational schools. It would then not be presumptuous of me to say that I can speak on this matter without bias. I will never understand the vitriol that is directed at denominational schools and by extension their pupils. I do not know if these people are aware that when they demonise these schools they are also demonising their pupils and alumni. The denominational schools have made a tremendous contribution to our country. Some of them were created to educate those whom the state forgot or ignored in the early years of our country. The \\\"cow shed\\\" schools educated the children of the indentured labourers. Church schools were set up to educate, at first, the children of the elite classes but then grew to encompass the community. Most of our nation's illustrious sons and daughters went to prestige schools. The list includes prime ministers and presidents, sporting heroes and ministers of government. How then can anyone find it in their hearts to bash and ridicule these institutions Claims that only rich children go to prestige schools could not be further from the truth. In my old school and in many others the pupil population was composed of children from middle class and poor backgrounds. There was no elitism, no group of spoiled rich children looking down on other schools. The prestige schools are populated by the children of Joe and Jane Public: farmers, police officers, sales clerks, public servants and many other average working citizens. Of course there are wealthy children, but there are also wealthy children in comprehensive and composite schools. I fail once again to see the problem. Entry into so-called prestige schools is based on merit. These schools set standards for entry. Their ethos is education, their doctrine is knowledge, their dogma is wisdom. They are academic institutions, that is what they are! It is only obvious that they will want the best of the best. Complaining that they only \\\"take bright children\\\" is the equivalent of complaining that graduate schools only take people who have an undergraduate degree. It makes no sense at all! Furthermore these schools do not force anyone to apply to them. Children put down their preferences. They are free and their parents are free to choose any school they wish to attend. It is being made to sound as though everyone who scores 95 per cent and over at SEA has to go to a prestige school. This is not true. They can choose to and many have gone to other schools due to various factors and have performed exceptionally. Instead of complaining that prestige schools do well, maybe critics ought to be examining why other schools do not do well and try to rectify this. The prestige schools can provide a possible answer and they need to be examined closely instead of being ridiculed. Students alone do not equal good results. If this were the case there would be no bad results in prestige schools (weak graduates come from them too) and no good results in non-denominational schools (many strong graduates come from them). Systems of respect, tolerance, discipline and well-thought-out procedures are ubiquitous in all of the denominational schools. Though they may be \\\"religious\\\" schools, religion is not forced down the throats of the pupils. Instead there is multiculturalism and tolerance. What these schools have are good disciplinary procedures and strong support systems. The Government and the Education Ministry need to provide these to their schools. In many ways those who ridicule prestige schools are also degrading the achievements of other schools in sport, academics and arts. They are in effect saying that the only reason people do well is that they go to a prestige school. This is an insult to all of the students of the nation. There is no such thing as a bad school, there is no such thing as a bad student, there is no such thing as a \\\"prestige\\\" school. There are schools that enforce the rules and discipline their students, and push academics and there are those that are abandoned by the state. There are schools where teachers are not given support and help to deal with violent and rowdy students. There are schools where the state shows total disregard and instead of restructuring and trying to change they sweep the problems under the carpet. The next time anyone has the audacity to bash and ridicule a prestige school just remember, a school is not just a building, it is the hearts of students you are stomping on and the feelings of children just like you were, just like your own children. * Rajiv Gopie won the President's Medal for business studies/modern studies in 2006.

Most of the subject areas where a School-Based Assessment (SBA) determined the final result were ungraded, it was learnt. The Ministry of Education yesterday confirmed that the school will have to query the ungraded subjects and resubmit the marks manually, so that the students can be graded by September. There was turmoil yesterday when students and their parents realised that they had not received grades for five of the seven subjects they wrote. \\\"None of the children got grades for the subjects with SBAs (School Based Assessments). In fact, the only results they got were for Mathematics, English A because they have no SBAs and Biology because the SBA was submitted late,\\\" one parent said.

The Ministry intends to convert 20 co-educational schools to single sex by September this year. These schools have been selected in pairs whereby the two schools are adjacent to or in close proximity to each other; one of the pair will be all-girls and the other all-boys. There has been criticism of this initiative, particularly from the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association (TTUTA). It has been put forward that there was not prior consultation and there is insufficient time for proper preparation for what will be a major change in this large number of schools. As I have indicated in my last two articles I support this initiative although I am convinced that it should be introduced in a somewhat different way. It is my hope that changes may be made which will produce more meaningful results and will also win the support of TTUTA for the project. There is now quite extensive literature on this subject of single-sex vs. co-educational education but three points stand out: the results are mostly indicative but not definitive of better results in single-sex settings; most of the positive results for single-sex education are applicable to single-sex classes as well as to single sex-schools (so there is no need for the Ministry to embark on the difficult task of converting schools from co-educational to single-sex at this stage); the measurement of better performance is invariably in terms of academic performance and not necessarily of the production of better citizens which should be a major objective of education (for example, arguments in favour of co-educational systems suggest that socialisation between boys and girls can be better achieved in co-educational settings). In my last article I argued that the objectives of the project could be achieved more successfully and with considerably less disruption by a different approach. I shall repeat these proposals with some elaboration. If schools are converted into separate all-boys and all-girls schools then the difficulty arises in assessing the results and of accounting for the differences between the schools as opposed to the effect of single-sex or coeducation. There are so many other factors that may differ between schools that may affect performance of boys or girls: leadership, standard of the student intake, experience of the teachers and so on. To overcome this problem my proposal is that the trials be conducted by streaming the first-year intake into boys, girls and mixed-sex classes in each of the 20 selected schools in September. This change can be effected with a minimum of disruption of the administration of the schools. It will place less stress on parents having to select different schools at the last minute. The project would have to be set up by persons knowledgeable in educational research. Does the Ministry of Education have the in-house capability to design and monitor such research or sufficient personnel to capture the data produced from 20 schools It is for this reason that I have suggested that the universities should be involved. The Government must allocate a sufficiently large sum of money to contract the universities to conduct the research in collaboration with the Ministry. A number of post-graduate scholarships should be offered for work on this research project (there will be a number of Bachelor of Education students graduating this year from the three universities). I want to again emphasise the importance of providing all of these schools with lunch rooms as an important aspect of socialising between the boys and girls. The opportunity should be taken to expand the school nutrition programme to all students in the schools with the parents paying for a (subsidised) meal at rates based on ability to pay, to zero payment where necessary. I would urge the Minister of Health to join the effort to attack obesity, which he has recognised as a looming problem, by ensuring that our school children are nurtured to follow proper nutrition. This effort should also be supported by the Minister of Agriculture so that food produced locally can replace the unhealthy \\\"fast foods\\\" that many children consume at school. The approach that I have suggested would allow for a smooth return to co-education if the results of the project suggest this as the best course of action but could also lead to the model of Trinity (East) and Bishops (East) with a boys school and a girls school on the same compound (not just in close proximity to each other). This is the system that I believe would give the best of both worlds; developing socialisation while giving the benefits of single-sex classes if our research shows this to be the better method of instruction.

In your disagreement with last week's piece, you were able to help me prove a very salient point: there is no link between religion and crime. You have helped me to toss one of the foundational arguments of this religious education thrust out of the window. A few of those touting this project were advocating that teaching religion in school would somehow come to affect crime through the reformation of social values. As was seen from last week's piece, religion and religiosity and the existence of religion in a school have nothing to do with crime. Rather, it is social and external factors such as poverty and inequality and the drug trade that cause crime in a country. This week I will tackle some of the other arguments used by the advocates of this programme and address some other concerns and questions. Firstly the method being proposed for this programme is not like theology which is taught in universities. If am to understand the Ministry of Education and others it will resemble the United Kingdom version of the course and/or the CXC version. To make things clear those syllabi are not in any way like theology. Theology is learning about religion, deconstructing religion, fighting with religion, arguing with it, reconciling it with fact and science and trying to get a deep understanding of religion in its cultural and historical context. This is how theology is taught at university; this is not how the planned programme is going to be run. Rather, if I am again to infer from the UK and CXC syllabi, it will be cursory approaches to the different religions, a comparative approach; there will be no questioning of whether it is right or wrong or makes any sense at all. Next, on to the UK itself, which many proponents of the programme are using as a model. A March 2011 report in the Daily Telegraph, a reputable daily newspaper, says the UK government has plans to cut funding to teacher training in religious instruction. The subject has also been removed from the English Baccalaureate certificate that bears proof of a student's performance in secondary school. It seems, then, that the touting of the UK as the model we should follow is another argument down the drain, since the UK is realising that this is a failed experiment. Staying in the UK, their programme allows parents to pull their children out of the classes based on school approval. I do hope that if, against all good sense, this \\\"atrocity'' is implemented in T&T parents will have the right to pull their children out of class. Nothing will be gained from having these courses in school. Rather, there is the need to rebuild and implement a civics programme in school. As a columnist who does not only like to criticise I am offering this counter solution. Instead of playing with a subject that is as inflammatory and controversial as race, the better idea would be to build a sense of citizenship and social responsibility in students. If children are made to feel that they are part of a country, a community and a national family from an early age, this will go a long way in reducing crime. Children need to feel as they are part of society. Whatever their economic and social backgrounds, if they feel accepted and part of a community there is a less likelihood of them turning on this community. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to spark a spirit of nationhood and pride in our country. This can start in school, where nation-building can take place, in the form of national education, learning the history of Trinidad and Tobago, our leaders, our struggles, the horrors of slavery, the brutality of indentureship, the sweetness of independence and fight to define ourselves as a multiracial, multi-ethnic people. A people of many colours and descended from many places but all one under our sun in our beautiful twin-island state. This will have a better impact on crime, this will increase pride, this will encourage social cohesion and nation-building, not religion, but nation. I caution that nothing good will come of this religion programme. It has the potential to disrupt the true purpose of schools: to educate and advance our nation. It can reopen wounds of the past when only one religion dominated our islands. It has the ability to make many children feel vulnerable and unaccepted. I will once again state that I am an agnostic and I have the utmost respect for religion and the right to worship. I strongly believe in religious tolerance and advocate that religions should remain a personal matter never to be interfered with by the state. I am however also a proponent of the secular state, of keeping religion out of all state institutions and that includes schools. Religion should either be taught in the form of theology that allows for debate and disagreement or not at all. If this programme is introduced into schools I suggest that pupils and parents be allowed to opt out. I also suggest that the facilitators be extremely well trained and unbiased. Specific courses run by the Education Ministry or UWI must be compulsory for teachers of religion. Furthermore a hotline should be set up for complaints to be dealt with if the facilitators or schools are trying to indoctrinate children. A specific powerful task force that does not have the usual T&T lackadaisical attitude needs to be set up to oversee this programme. I am wholly against this religion in the schools programme, but if it is going to be done, it needs to be done properly, or else I foresee trouble.

On the campaign trail, Bolsonaro said he wanted to \\\"enter the Education Ministry with a flamethrower to remove Paulo Freire.\\\" Bolsonaro and other conservatives say Freire, one of the founders of critical pedagogy, turns students into \\\"political militants.\\\" (AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo, File) President Jair Bolsonaro is taking his anti-leftist ideological war to Brazil's classrooms and universities, causing angst among teachers and education officials who say the government wants to fight an enemy that doesn't exist. Bolsonaro and top officials have announced plans to revise textbooks to excise references to feminism, homosexuality and violence against women, say the military will take over some public schools and frequently bash Paulo Freire, one of Brazil's most famous educators, whose ideas had worldwide influence. \\\"One of the goals to get Brazil out of the worst positions in international education rankings is to combat the Marxist rubbish that has spread in educational institutions,\\\" Bolsonaro tweeted on the eve of his inauguration. While students may not yet find many differences as they return to school this month, changes are afoot. \\\"We are still waiting to see how, in practice, all this is going to turn out,\\\" said Nilton Brandao, president of one of Brazil's largest teachers' unions, PROIFES Federacao. \\\"Right now, it does not make any sense.\\\" For the government, the ideological battle begins with the removal of Freire's legacy in schools, which Bolsonaro and other conservatives say turns students into \\\"political militants.\\\" Freire, who died in 1997, was one of the founders of critical pedagogy. Conservatives contend Freire's method encourages students to challenge traditional values such as family and the church. A socialist, Freire was briefly imprisoned during the 1964-1985 military dictatorship that Bolsonaro has repeatedly praised. On the campaign trail, Bolsonaro said he wanted to \\\"enter the Education Ministry with a flamethrower to remove Paulo Freire.\\\" Bolsonaro and his education minster appear to be looking for inspiration in philosophers like Olavo de Carvalho, a Brazilian who lives in the U.S. and is known for his anti-globalism and anti-socialist views. While Freire believed in the state's mission to educate the Brazilian people, including poor rural farmers and the illiterate, de Carvalho advocates reducing the state's role in education, favoring private or religious schools. \\\"The government does not have to educate anyone; it is the society that has to educate itself,\\\" de Carvalho said last year during a talk about education on his YouTube channel. He added that proposals \\\"based on the idea that the federal government is the great educator I am going to fight to the death.\\\" After Bolsonaro took office Jan. 1, the Education Ministry dismantled its diversity department and published a new set of guidelines for textbook publishers that eliminated references to topics such as violence against women and sexism. Receiving an outpouring of criticism, officials backtracked on the revised texts, saying the new guidelines had been written by the previous administration and published by mistake. Even so, Education Minister Ricardo Velez Rodriguez vowed in his inaugural speech to end the \\\"aggressive promotion of the gender ideology.\\\" Velez instead defended what he called traditional values, such as family, church, school and the nation, which he said were threatened by a \\\"crazy globalist wave.\\\" \\\"The Brazilian who travels is a cannibal. He steals things from the hotel, steals the life jacket from the plane,\\\" said Velez in an interview with Veja magazine this week. \\\"Our kids and teenagers must receive citizenship education, which teaches how to act according to the law and morality.\\\" Bolsonaro has said he would review the content of Brazil's national high school exam to rid it of any questions on gender or LGBT movements. He made the announcement in a YouTube video after seeing a question from last year's exam on a \\\"secret dialect used by gays and transvestites,\\\" called Pajuba. The Pajuba dialect mixes Portuguese and West African languages and is mostly used in Afro-Brazilian religions but has also been adopted by the Brazilian LGBT community. \\\"Don't worry, there won't be any more questions like this,\\\" Bolsonaro said. After his inauguration, Velez told the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that his office will encourage municipalities interested in letting their schools be run by the military or the police. Brazil has 13 military-run schools, which are aimed at educating children of soldiers but also accept some students based on merit. The military is the most respected institution in the country and its schools have a better reputation than many public schools. The military is also sometimes called in to co-run public schools and bring back order. Last year, 39.5 million students attended a public school, while private institutions, which can cost several thousand dollars a month, served 9 million. Opponents say the selective admission process of military schools would end up being discriminatory in impoverished areas. In general, critics say the administration is focused on the wrong things. Claudia Costin, director of Brazil's Center for Excellence and Innovation in Education Policies, a think tank based in Rio de Janeiro, said efforts should focus on improving training and salaries for teachers, making the entrance exam for teachers tougher and building a common syllabus for schools across the country. The government \\\"complains about indoctrination at school,\\\" Costin said. \\\"But it is not with laws that you solve these things.\\\" Brazil ranked 63rd out of the 72 countries and regions in the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment, conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to the group, Brazil has as one of the largest shares of adults without secondary education. Schools are overcrowded, teacher salaries and low and school buildings are often crumbling. More than 5.800 schools had no water supply in 2017, nearly 5.000 had no electricity and 8.400 had no sewage, according to government figures. Many Brazilians don't appear convinced by Bolsonaro's plans. In a poll published Jan. 8, 71 percent of those surveyed said politics should be discussed at school and 54 percent thought it was fine to discuss sexual education inside the classroom. The poll, however, indicated that the new administration's conservative views played well with evangelicals, a powerful voter base for Bolsonaro during the campaign. Fifty-nine percent of evangelicals said they did not approve of sexual education being discussed at school. The Datafolha poll was based on 2,077 interviews carried out Dec. 18 and Dec. 19, with a margin of error of two percentage points. Caua dos Santos Borges, a 15-year-old public school student in Rio de Janeiro, said that in her experience teachers rarely spoke about politics in the classroom and gender had never felt like a core area of the curriculum. \\\"Once, a student asked the teacher if he supported Bolsonaro, but the teacher didn't respond and changed the subject,\\\" dos Santos Borges said.

Universal Secondary Education The Minister of Education reminded the House that Universal Secondary Education was introduced when the present Prime Minister was Minister of Education. The Minister did not remind the House of the chaos that ensued when this was done without preparation. I am of the view that some of the ills from which the education system still suffers, and present social ills in the wider society, can be traced back to the way in which that decision was implemented. Universal Secondary Education is essential not only to ensure equity in the society but also for the good of national development, and its success or failure is determined by the way in which the expansion is carried out. As long as there are deficiencies in primary education, there will be a number of pupils who are not properly prepared for secondary school. In the past these pupils were catered for in post-primary classes. When all pupils were moved into secondary schools these post-primary classes should have been replaced by special remedial classes in the secondary schools. In most cases this was not done and such pupils moved through secondary schooling with the deficiencies not corrected and so their benefit from such schooling is minimal. They left secondary school with low self-esteem and in many instances became susceptible to recruitment to \\\"gangs''. Has any research been done at the University of the West Indies to examine the effects of passage through secondary school and subsequent fate of such pupils This is the second time that the introduction of a system to improve the educational level of our populationand to move toward greater social equityhas been implemented in a way that has had unintended, unfavourable effects. The first was in the introduction of Junior and Senior Secondary schools. This was in itself a good step toward Universal Secondary Education but in order to accommodate the maximum number of pupils, a shift system was introduced which led to students being unsupervised by parents or teachers for long periods each day. Also extra-curricula activities were limited as the school facilities were needed from early morning to late afternoon to accommodate the two shifts. The Minister referred to the Strategy Report of his Ministry which, as he has pointed out, is available on the Ministry's website. In fact it is all about organisation and management and little on education. I have tried unsuccessfully to get from it \\\"a model for educational development of our children'' that the Minister stated it contains. The 1993-2003 paper on education, which became Government's policy document, was written by a team of experts with wide experience in education. The present strategy document was written by a sole author whose credentials in education are not given. From my experience in the Public Service the proposals in the Strategy Report would make a difficult fit into the systems of that service. The Minister was very open about the underperformance of the pupils in the education system and for this we must give him full marks. What was missing in the Minister's presentation was a proposal for diagnosing the causes of this underperformance, school by school and for monitoring progress in remedying this situation. As the Minister is a medical doctor he will appreciate the need for a proper diagnosis before treatment is applied. In the case of the school system misdiagnosis may lead to adverse effects on many lives for many years. I do not advocate the uncritical adoption of systems from abroad but the system of inspection of schools by an independent external team of inspectors as is in place in the United Kingdom where it is a legal requirement and has great merit. This system should be adopted, with any necessary modifications to meet local conditions. I was informed that a previous Minister of Education carried a team to the UK to examine this system but nothing was done to implement it. The present system of school supervisors is inadequate to the task of diagnosing the problems in schools. In the UK every school is examined at least once in every five years (more frequently if the school is underperforming; it has been proposed recently that inspection will be less frequent if the school is performing well) by a team of inspectors, specially trained and registered by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). Inspectors spend about a week in each school. They sit in classrooms to hear lessons being delivered, look at school work books to assess how much feedback teachers are giving to students, assess the quality of management of the school; report of the physical condition of the school, the relations with the community, discipline and the behaviour of the pupils, examination results and progress (or otherwise) of the school since the last inspection. In January of this year changes were made to this inspection system (see Ofsted website): \\\"Key changes: In judging the quality of the school, inspectors will make four key judgments:- Achievement; the quality of teaching; behaviour and safety; leadership and management''. ... \\\"inspectors will take account of the four key judgments and how well the school promotes pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.'' Each school will now have to submit a self-evaluation report on a yearly basis which will be examined by the inspection team. The Education Discussion Group has in the past recommended this system to previous Ministers of Education. Ms Leela Ramdeen, a member of the Group, has personal experience of the system having worked in an education department in the UK. The system is transparent and the report on each school is posted on the Ofsted website; for any school in the UK one can download the last Ofsted report. John Spence is professor emeritus, UWI.

PHOTO by INNIS FRANCIS Education Minister Dr Tim Gopeesingh issued a statement on Sunday, ahead of today's opening of the 2013 academic year. The following is his statement - I wish to extend sincere best wishes to all the near 250,000 students in the Early Childhood, Primary and Secondary Schools of our nation, as well as the approximately 16,000 Principals, Vice Principals, Senior Teachers, Heads of Departments, Deans and Teachers for a very successful, enjoyable, healthy and safe year. In the past three years we have pursued an aggressive, reengineering, transformation and paradigm shift in our Education System. This to ensure our education sector is second-to-none globally. Upon completion of laptop distribution in September, nearly 70,000 laptops would have been provided to Forms I-IV students, all Principals of Primary and Secondary Schools and School Supervisors. Near to 4,000 Teachers have been trained with the infusion of the curriculum with ICT. All 134 Secondary Schools have functioning Computer Labs, ranging from 1 to 6 labs; three hundred of the 476 Primary Schools have Computer Labs, all serviced by more than 150 IT Technicians. We are now moving closer to achieving Universal Early Childhood Education by 2015. We have 200 ECCE Centres functioning - 71 run by Servol and 80 Private Sector ECCE Centres are now partnering with the MoE. More than 800 teachers have been trained in ECCE, now bringing close to 15,000 students ages 3 and 4 under the formal ECCE education programmes. Stakeholder consultations commenced on the situation of Special Needs Students with more teachers being trained in the 24 MoE and Private Special Needs Schools. Wider and deeper consultations are continuing to effect a comprehensive policy of mainstreaming of special needs students inclusivity in Education. Primary and ECCE School Curriculum review and reform have been completed while Secondary School Curriculum Reform is being initiated. There has been significant improvement in Literacy and Numeracy in all Primary Schools and very much improved academic performances in SEA and CAPE. Fewer students are scoring less than 30 percent in SEA, moving down from 13 percent to 8 percent. 72 percent of SEA students scored above 50 percent, up from about 58 percent three years ago. Over 100 Primary Schools have moved up from underperforming (Academic Watch) to well-performing (Mostly Effective), while another 100 have moved to the Excelling category.There has been a 10 percent improvement in Creative writing and Language Arts. At CAPE, from about 86 percent three years ago to 93 percent achieving Grades I to V. Students from over 80 Primary Schools have placed within the first 200 SEA places and National Scholarships have moved from approximately 250 to 372 in the past three years. The introduction of the Continuous Assessment Component (CAC) has led to significant improvements in performance in the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA). Thousands of Teachers have been exposed to various Teacher Training and Development Workshops over the last three years in several areas, while School Supervisors are undergoing training in Leadership and Management. In infrastructure, from July 2010 to October 2012, Repairs and Maintenance had been carried out in over 650 schools at a cost of 340 Million, using more than 450 small, medium and long-term contractors, creating thousands of jobs. In 18 months, there were 939 emergency jobs dealt with in our schools, while daily, there are about 6 schools experiencing emergencies with toilets, sewer and water systems, major and minor electrical problems and pest infestations. This is as a result of inherited widespread school dilapidation from the past. Approximately 100 schools are over 100 years of age; 200 are more than 50 years of age. During the repair programme in July/August 2013, 212 schools underwent Repairs and Maintenance about 30 of these requiring major electrical works. There have been 32 Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) schools constructed, with 20 more to be completed by December and 26 commencing within one month. Another 50 ECCE schools are to be constructed in the upcoming fiscal year. There were 11 Primary Schools constructed, another 14 are in progress and 50 more are scheduled to commence soon. With respect to Secondary Schools, seven have been constructed, nine are in progress and 17 Science and Administrative blocks will commence. All of this has been done throughout Trinidad and Tobago within the last three years. Curriculum vocational qualification subjects are being undertaken from 42 schools in 2010 to 102 schools in 2013. Cadets, Boys Scouts, Girl Guides are being strongly introduced in our schools. A strong focus is now being placed on Physical Education and Sports in schools - Total Gyms are now being procured for 50 Secondary Schools. Improved Schools Based Management is being actively pursued for prevention and reduction of indiscipline and dysfunctional behaviour in schools with a zero-tolerance approach to bullying. Schools are now provided with over 700 Student Support Services personnel including Guidance Counsellors, School Social Workers, Behavioural, Clinical and Educational Psychologists. Over 42,000 students from Forms 3, 5 and 6 were exposed to a two-day symposium to Career Guidance from six Tertiary Learning Institutions, fifty Business Corporations for over one hundred professions. The MoE has undergone serious organisational restructuring incorporating Human Resource Management Information Systems in accordance with its Strategic Plan 2011 to 2015 and its prioritization. In this Academic year, students will continue to benefit from them and many more new policies which serve to reinforce this Governments commitment to Education since this sector remains one of our mainstays in our nations continued path to progress and prosperity. But we cannot succeed without the cooperation of all of our parents, teachers and students. Parents please remember that without your commitment to your childrens education and personal development, our society is in danger of losing even more of our young people to crime and violence. We suffer a crisis in parenting at this time and the time has come for you to recommit to your duties and responsibilities to your children. Build stronger bonds with your children. Talk to them about their lives, their problems, their interests and their emotions. Ensure they are well supervised at all times. Let them know they are subject to strong boundaries and discipline and above all. Let them know that you love and care for them. To the Principals and teachers, I applaud you for your dedicated work but I must implore you to recommit to the very noble task with which you are entrusted as educators. We seek a reduction in teacher absenteeism and better academic performance among our students, especially in their literacy and numeracy skills. Teach our children with inspiration, love, caring and dedication. And to our students, I urge every single one of you to be mindful that you are now benefiting from opportunities that no other generation in this country ever had. You therefore have a duty to your parents, your teachers, your fellow citizens, whose tax dollars fund you, your country and especially yourselves, to excel at your school work. Be respectful, disciplined and diligent with the aim of one day serving our nation as dedicated hard-working citizens. I urge all Principals and Teachers to join the students in reciting and singing the words of our National Pledge and our National Anthem respectively, in honour of our countrys 51st Anniversary of Independence and commit to its ideas. As stakeholders in the Education System, we are the ones who have a special duty to demonstrate patriotism and we must be the best example of the decent, law-abiding citizens at this time and beyond, to preserve our beautiful country for our future generations. Im sure that we will all work together towards these goals and I wish you a very safe, productive school year ahead, filled with achievement and joy, rich in Gods blessings.

She stated some of the worst abuse takes place at home from parents and family, in our schools, in other institutions and in the community. \\u201cToo often society shuts its eyes to child trafficking, physical and humiliating treatment and other forms of violence that seriously affect a child's dignity, development and physical and psychological integrity,\\u201d said Persad-Bissessar. She said as adults and as leaders, we all share a solemn responsibility to do all we must to ensure all children are protected and saved from abusive situations. Outside of this country, Persad-Bissessar pointed out that in Syria, which has been ravaged by war for nearly five years, more than two million children have been negatively affected. \\u201cWar deprived them of their families, their homes, and the comforts we often take for granted. These children remain vulnerable, while some countries that pledged to protect them are closing their doors, leaving these children homeless, stateless, hungry and abandoned. \\u201cThe Syrian children of war are not unique. Children in every culture and at every stratum of society face various forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence,\\u201d she added. Persad-Bissessar reminded that as prime minister she worked toward the protection of the nation's children. \\u201cI ensured that the Children's Authority became functional. My first act as the country's leader was to pursue a Children's Life Fund, which to date has saved the lives of more than 200 of our children. We built and equipped a children's hospital that is still unopened. My government also focused on education, guaranteeing the right of children to a good education from nursery to tertiary,\\u201d she stated, adding the work to protect the children must continue. Persad-Bissessar further noted that 61 years ago, the General Assembly of the United Nations urged its member states to institute a Universal Children's Day to create worldwide fraternity and understanding among children, which was followed with the declaration of Universal Children's Day, to be celebrated on November 20 each year, and in 1989 it adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child. All these steps, she stated, were intended to formalise a promise that world leaders would do everything to protect and promote the rights of children. She said today the world is far from fulfilling that pledge to take every possible measure to protect the rights of children \\u201cto survive and thrive, to learn and grow, to make their voices heard and to reach their full potential\\u201d. \\u201cWith multi-lateral arrangements, strong public policy and legislation already in place, we have no excuse for failing to protect children, and we must do more, starting now. \\u201cWe must ensure that children not only survive but also thrive, become educated and are protected from violence so they can grow with love and affection and become respected and responsible members of society,\\u201d stated Persad-Bissessar.

Originally developed for the World Summit for Children by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey three (MICS 3) was the first comprehensive study of the living situation of children and women to be done in nearly 20 years. Delivering the feature address at the formal launch of MICS 3 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Port of Spain yesterday, Social Development Minister Amery Browne indicated that the survey showed that more children were going to school, but the majority of this country still had no access to clean water. Mortality rates also remain high. \\\"In the area of health, the MICS data indicated that infant mortality was, at the time of this survey, 29 deaths per 1000 live births and the under five mortality was 35 per 1000 live births in this country,\\\" Browne said. However, Browne added that even though the MICS 3 was customised to meet the needs of this country and successfully carried out on 5,557 households in the North West, North Central, South West and Eastern regions as well as Tobago back in 2005 by the Central Statistical Office with support from UNICEF, it should only be used as a guideline for policy makers on the situation of children and women. He indicated that the MICS 3 had produced statistically sound and internationally comparable estimates of a range of indicators in the areas health, education, child protection and HIV/AIDS which would allow them to address their shortcomings. \\\"And this is indeed very well timed because in this period of economic crisis around the world it is so essential that we continue to invest in the welfare of our citizens, particularly in our nation's women and children,\\\" he said. MICS Data Analysis and senior lecturer at the University of the West Indies, Dr Godfrey St Bernard, added that the data collected from MICS 3 was relatively better as it pertained to child health and would help the government as it moves toward developing a caring nation and vision 20/20.

Some 74 students of UWI's Bachelor of Education (B Ed) Physical Education Secondary programme, as part of their field study module, made poster/oral presentations of their final research report which was held at the UWI Sport and Physical Education Centre (SPEC) auditorium recently. Director of the centre, Dr Iva Camille Gloudon, said, \\\"This programme represents the first time that local physical education teachers will receive a degree in Physical Education from a local tertiary level institution.\\\" Looking for creative ways to incorporate physical education into children's everyday lives, students selected from the following themes to make their presentations: Social learning through Physical Education; Health and Fitness; Staff Development; Self-Esteem/ Perceptions of Competence; Integration with other subjects, Motivation and choice, Values, Social and Personal Responsibility/ Behaviour. The conference consisted of two poster sessions and three parallel oral presentation sessions. Hayes Jones, a physical education teacher from Belmont Secondary School looked at \\\"Boys' preferences for and values of Physical Education\\\". Looking at attendance, participation, preference and frequency of physical education, Jones noted that these things were not regularised at his school. Highlighting some of the changes he felt would take physical education to another level, Jones said, \\\"We need Physical Education to be properly integrated into the syllabus. We need staff to start looking at physical education more seriously as well as allotting more time in the form of double periods so students can benefit from actually learning a sport and doing some physical activity.\\\" Through his study, Jones learned that boys at his school preferred more traditional sports such as cricket and football while girls preferred netball as opposed to the non-traditional sports such as swimming, volleyball and tennis. Other students also sought to bring the subject to the forefront.

Education Minister Dr Tim Gopeesingh disclosed this at the post-Cabinet news conference on Thursday at the Coco Reef Hotel, Tobago, where the Cabinet held its meeting. Gopeesingh said that it was the vision of the Prime Minister to make early childhood care education universal as she did with the secondary school system. He noted that there were some 34,000 children between the ages of three and four in the country, 80 per cent of whom are enrolled in early childhood care systems in the private sector. Government, he said, will partner with the private sector to ensure there is universal early childhood care by 2015. He said in June and July this year, the Ministry conducted a series of consultations to introduce the concept of a public/private partnership arrangement where private stakeholders expressed their willingness to partner with the Ministry. A memorandum of understanding, he said, will be signed between the Government and private early childhood care providers in accordance with selected governance models. This initiative, he said, is estimated to cost some $100 million annually. Gopeesingh noted that some 20 per cent of the 34,000 are enrolled in Government ECCE centres, 70 of these 200 centres are run by Servol. Cabinet, he said, further approved a number of employment positions on contract to ensure these ECCE centres are well staffed. He added that Cabinet agreed to increase the subvention to Servol to meet payments of salaries and other expenses. Gopeesingh noted that there are some persons employed in ECCE centres for some 30 years and who do not have \\\"tremendous qualifications\\\" nor qualify for pension. As a result, Cabinet has approved an ex gratia payment of some $39 million for these persons for their service. Gopeesingh also noted that there were a number of positions in the teaching service that cannot be filled as teachers do not want to be posted to schools in remote areas. He said Cabinet agreed to the employment on contract of 200 assistant instructors at levels one, two and three to be placed in secondary schools for three years at a cost of $24 million.

One of the most beautiful sights in any T&T schoolyard is children of different races playing together. Recently I was at a Roman Catholic girls' secondary school in central, and in the schoolyard I saw children of Indian descent, children of African descent, children of mixed race, children in hijabs, children with dreadlocks and corn rows. When the bell sounded for change of class, the girls all stood and a prayer was said over the microphone, in which they all seemed to participate. During this time, one teacher was preparing a choir to sing Indian songs for a function that was imminent at the school. Remember, this is a Roman Catholic school; you could not tell that from observation. This is who we are. For my own part I went to Harmony Hall Presbyterian school in Union, Marabella. The school was about 90 per cent Indian, as were my friends. The teachers were mainly Indian, and all nurturing, as I recall. Mr Nagessar\\\"Nags\\\" to all of his pupils, still alive and an icon on Union Road, even asked my uncle about me, decades after I left. At morning assemblies, we all sang both traditional and Hindu spiritual songs. I have been a teacher for my entire adult life, and I refuse to see race when I teach. I learned that from Indian teachers at Harmony Hall Presbyterian. If what the now-besieged principal of the Tunapuna Hindu School says is true, then I fear we are retrogressing. And what about this very important principle that schools are secular spaces fundamentally, and that any child, whatever her/his race or religion, should be able to attend any convent, St Mary's, Presentation, Naps, SAGHS, or any comprehensive in this country When the SEA results appear in the papers, we see children across races and religions going to schools of their choice, with no reference to race or creed. Children from Sea Lots go to Fatima. Children from Felicity go to Presentation, Chaguanas. There are very few Hindu secondary schools in the country, so it is very important that all secondary schools open their doors to Hindu children. In the same way, Hindu primary schools must open their doors to children of every race. We can't have edicts that keep children out of school on the basis of race or religion. This will bring the ugliness of children being denied school places on the basis of race, as if we here are living in the American south, in the 1950s. This is a beautiful country run by a multiracial party that won seats in the East-West corridor, and in Tobago, on the basis of multi-racial support for an Indian Prime Minister. At all cost, the party has to show that it means what it says. We can't rise if black children on the East-West corridor are denied school places on account of race. The lesson from the NAR and now from the People's Partnership, is that the black community in the country wants to move on. And I think we need a Minister of Education who stands for something, and who would not hide behind the technicality of an Equal Opportunity body, when what is needed is for him to say that all children must be free to enter any of the nation's schools, whether Hindu, Catholic, or government. And we can't have a Minister going to the police with his \\\"friend\\\" when the issue is an allegation that his friend is preventing black children from attending a school he over-sees. I find this issue to be particularly distressing.

How much is political and how much educational, I leave it to others to assess. Listening to the political leader at the public forum in Point Fortin, I found it commendable that an important part of his lecture was focused on the questions of \\\"separation of powers\\\" and \\\"human rights\\\", two concepts which rightly deserve explanation and elucidation in today's T&T. However, the fiery speech by the leader failed to give a full picture on the reality of both concepts. Mr Manning was digging deep into the letter and spirit of Baron de Montesquieu, a French philosopher and statesman, believing in reason and human progress and questioning tradition and authority. His classic, On the Spirit of Laws remains the main source of reference when it comes to the question of separation of powers. Montesquieu's book could usefully be a part of the curriculum at our law schools today. Mr. Manning is certainly at the right source and has the merit of bringing Montesquieu into T&T's present day constitutional reality. He elaborates quite extensively on the requirement of strict independence of the judiciary vis--vis the executive and the legislature, but has very little to say about the separation of powers between the executive and legislature. Here is what Montesquieu has to say: \\\"When the law making and the law enforcement powers are united, there can be no liberty.\\\" In the scenario that obtains currently in T&T, where out of the 26 elected lawmakers, 22 are at the same time, part of the executive, the lines of separation of powers between the executive and the legislature are blurred if not removed. Moving to the question of human rights, Mr Manning has the merit of making this important question a central part of his lecture at Point Fortin. However, what is missing is the absence of any reference to the international dimension of human rights. No mention is made of the basic source, namely the Universal System of Human Rights, starting with the Universal Declaration, and the two major international human rights conventions, one on civil and political rights, and the other on economic, social and cultural rights. T&T is a part of this international human rights system, commonly called the Bill of Rights, and it has ratified both conventions. On both laws and policy measures, implementing and reporting, T&T is seriously lagging behind. By way of example, reference is made to the shelving of a comprehensive gender policy or the tardy children's protection legislation, and in terms of reporting, no reports on economic, social and cultural rights have been submitted to the UN supervisory body since the early 90s. Mr Manning elaborated at some length on the question of economic and social rights, using the right to housing as an example. There is no such thing as a right to housing, the argument goes, because such a right, and by extension other economic and social rights, cannot be invoked and enforced before a local court. This argument does not hold, certainly not in doctrine and practice of the international human rights community. While it is true that economic, social and cultural rights as enshrined in the International Covenant are not immediately applicable and enforceable before a national court, except in the rare case of \\\"public interest litigation\\\", these rights constitute nevertheless a legal basis for empowering people to claim implementation as an entitlement and not simply as a gesture of goodwill by the Government. Nobody argues that housing, education, health, food, water and sanitation, safety, and other essentials, must be made available overnight to all citizens, by a simple stroke of legislation. But within the human rights community, there is common agreement that every effort must be made, within a certain timeframe, towards progressive realisation of these rights. This means that the Government must strive towards gradual implementation, by allocating the necessary resources and setting the right policy priorities, as compared with other, less essential projects. Incidentally, the UN has recently introduced what is called a rights-based approach to development planning and programming in its country operations. To its credit, the Government has recently endorsed this approach in a new development assistance framework agreement with the UN system. So much, then, for public information and education on two key issues omnipresent in today's T&T. It would point to the fact that there is always room for gaining new, correct and relevant information through education and learning, even when delivered in the halls of PNM \\\"colleges'' and by a most prominent teacher. After all, learning and education is a life-long process and is everybody's business!

This adage still holds good in so many instan\\u00adces, but I would like to contradict him on behalf of one person, our inimitable and tireless Minister of Educa\\u00adtion, Anthony Garcia. I wish to salute him for the several initiatives he has put in place to raise the standard of education as it obtains today. From day one, he has hit the road running, and like Usain Bolt, he has not stopped. His latest endea\\u00advour, to deal with the inadequacies of mathema\\u00adtics, and language arts, inclusive of creative writing, could not have been more providential and opportune. I would like however to humbly suggest, in addition to the extensive teachers/principals/supervisors/district teams workshops already conducted, several retirees who are willing to come onboard be invited to share their skills, knowledge and expertise with deficient pupils in their communities. Thus, these young people could access additional help to bring them to an acceptable standard. I had been offering free lessons in English language, creative writing and \\u201cbroughtupsy\\u201d to several pupils from my community, from both secondary and primary schools, since 2009. I even wrote two books, Caribbean Sunshine For Mammie's Children and Mammie's Folklore Stories, using the children themselves as the protagonists in the stories to encourage them to enjoy reading, build their vocabulary, and improve their sentence structure and writing skills. Unfortunately, I had to stop because of medical treatment for some time. Today, some of these young people have pro\\u00adgressed to university, and those from the primary schools are now at Hillview College, Holy Cross College and North Eastern College, to name a few. I marvel at the way in which these \\u201cunmanage\\u00adable\\u201d teenagers were able to come to terms with the realisation that they are indeed important and that there are indeed people who really care about them and want to see them become good citizens, no matter what obstacles they may encounter. A bit of \\u201ctough love\\u201d helped tremendously. They were pleasantly surprised at their success in their exams, especially in English and creative writing. As such, I would like to exhort other retirees like myself who are willing to offer themselves in this nation-building venture for our young people, and posterity. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

I shall quote directly from the budget presentation for I find it difficult to interpret exactly what is intended. Education and GATE \\\"A further review will be informed by the findings of studies undertaken by the Centre for Workforce Research and Development funded by the European Development Fund under the aegis of the University of the West Indies. The study will identify the skills gaps within the local economy, thereby guiding education and training needs that are aligned with labour market information.\\\" \\\"The GATE programme will now be subject to more rigorous pay-for-performance rules with respect to students to ensure value for money spent and greater accountability will be required from the institutions that are registered in this programme\\\". I am in agreement with the intention to monitor the GATE programme more closely. I suggest that the GATE programme entitlement should be subject to a \\\"means test\\\". The Prime Minister recently pointed out that equality is not the same as equity; it is equity that we should pursue. Is there equity when \\\"the people's money\\\" is used to pay the university fees of the sons and daughters of millionaires Do the proposals by the Minister of Finance imply that GATE will be given only for particular areas of study This would be a big departure from present policy and from many of the reasons which are usually given for the existence of GATE. The Seamless Education System \\\"The Seamless Education System is a multi-phase project. The first phase of this project will improve equity, quality and relevance of educational services provided to all children in Early Childhood Care and Education, and in primary education.\\\" For some time now I have been struggling to understand the concept, as espoused by the Ministry of Education, of \\\"Seamless Education\\\". Does it mean passage from one level to the next (primary to secondary) without a barrier Can we expect that the SEA will be removed (a development which I would support if only to save our children from the trauma of this examination) The only reason we keep this examination is because we have a system of so-called prestige schools. If the SEA were to be removed and replaced (as is the case in many developed countries) by assignment to secondary schools by geography, influential parents whose children are assigned to non-prestige schools would soon force Government, and the various religious denominations who manage schools, to make all schools prestige schools! The Minister of Education spent a great deal of his valuable time discussing general financial issues and replying to Opposition comments. Why don't Government and Opposition organise their affairs in such a way that certain speakers deal with the economy in general, others are assigned to criticise the opposite side and let the various Ministers tell us about their areas of responsibility Instead, Ministers having spent most of their time outside of their ministerial responsibilities then have to rush the last part (and most important part from the point of view of their direct responsibilities) of their presentation and have to ask anxiously: \\\"how much time have I got left\\\" He recorded the achievements of the Government in education. He discussed the laptop (computer) programme, primary school curriculum, Early Childhood Education, the strategy document of his Ministry, the introduction of universal secondary education and \\\"Universal\\\" tertiary education with GATE. Laptop programme I do not believe the laptop programme was a good idea. The laptops should have been provided to the schools. In any event there should have been a \\\"means test\\\" to promote equity in Government expenditure. Primary school curriculum I agree with the proposals to introduce \\\"non-academic\\\" subjects. He stated: \\\"we are now moving to continuous base-assessment programmes so that students would be able to do things like physical education, visual and performing arts, music, dance theatre, drama, health and family life, moral, values, ethics; all of these will be taught up to Standard 5, compulsory up to Standard 5, so we are beginning to get a more all-rounded child rather than just academic performance\\\". His way of getting away from the present situation whereby students are only taught the subjects which are examined in the SEA is to have the other subjects assessed continuously and the marks obtained thereby to be included in the SEA marks. This is a bold step and no doubt fraught with many problems, not least of which will be to achieve parity in marking among teachers and schools. With respect to the \\\"academic curriculum\\\" the introduction of Geography should be considered. Modern Geography places mankind in his/her environment and so includes social studies as well as environmental studies. Early Childhood Education I have some concern for the use of de-populated primary schools as Early Childhood Centres. Many of these primary schools are not even suitable for primary education today. Also the idea of placing very young children with primary school children, some of whom will be 11 or 12 years old, is fraught with danger. John Spence is professor Emeritus, UWI.

The workshop featured an aquaponics-themed presentation and graduation ceremony for 67 participants ages 3 to 13. Aquaponics \\u2013 the symbiotic system combining aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as fish in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) wherein, the fish waste produced provides an organic food source for the growing plants, and the plants, in turn, provide a natural filter for the water the fish live in \\u2013 was just one of the topics covered during the two-week workshop. The children also learned about climate change and green technologies through outdoor activities, games, arts and crafts, and a visit to the NIHERST National Science Centre. The workshop was a result of The UWI St Augustine's Department of Chemistry's ongoing SECCRS initiative, an 18-month project funded by the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme (GEF-SGP). The project's overall goal is to empower communities to apply practical knowledge of green technologies to best meet the need of local circumstances. Members of the Heights of Guanapo community were trained to use aquaponics to avoid soil and water contamination from the landfill. Nine of these adults were then mentored to work directly with the children of the ASCC and Guanapo to pass on what they had learned. The UWI Department of Chemistry and Department of Clinical Veterinary Sciences Aquatic Health Unit, the Guanapo Community Environmental Development Organisation (GCEDO) and the National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST) have a unique partnership with the ASCC to accomplish the project goals. According to the workshop facilitator and the SECCRS project team leader Dr Leonette Cox of The UWI's Department of Chemistry, \\u201cThe big picture is knowledge sharing and building confidence and capacity in community.\\u201d And confidence was in full display as the combined teams of children led by the Guanapo facilitators performed poems, skits and dance numbers dedicated to aquaponics to a crowd of parents, UWI staff members and others. The day ended with gift presentations and certificates for the young participants. The project's next phase involves project leadership and proposal writing training.
