Author Ferris Eanfar tackles cryptocurrencies and human rights in his latest book. (NewsUSA) - \\\"Violent revolutions are inevitable when economic and political conditions become intolerable to the masses,\\\" says Ferris Eanfar, CEO of the Gini Foundation. With the rapid rise in wealth inequality and the escalation of economic and social conflicts in recent years, it appears Mr. Eanfar's predictions are coming true. \\\"Yes, sadly, this is what keeps the Gini team very busy,\\\" says Eanfar, regarding the Gini Foundation, which is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, economic, technology and education platform. Gini's mission is to protect human rights and prevent large-scale violence by creating a more equitable and sustainable cryptocurrency-based monetary system. According to sources familiar with the platform, compared to other cryptocurrencies, Gini is designed to work more safely and effectively in real-world commerce. As a best-selling author and International Political Economy expert, cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) architect, financial services professional, and former U.S. Government Intelligence operative, Eanfar has a unique perspective. In his most recent book, \\\"GINI: Capitalism, Cryptocurrencies & the Battle for Human Rights,\\\" Eanfar provides refreshing answers to big questions about privacy, A.I., cryptocurrencies, taxes, economic freedom and other socioeconomic trends and technologies that are shaping the future of humanity. It's About Justice When asked to summarize the book, Eanfar says, \\\"It's a book about justice and the technologies, systems, and public policies that Gini is building and supporting to achieve justice. Unsustainable wealth and power concentration is destroying capitalism and democracy on Earth today. For the first time in the history of capitalism, authoritarian countries collectively produce a greater share of global GDP than democratic countries. And a majority of the Earth's human population thinks capitalism is destructive to human civilization. The Gini Platform is designed to solve these problems.\\\" Privacy Is a Fundamental Human Right When asked about the importance of privacy, Eanfar says, \\\"All human rights depend on the right to privacy. Democracy cannot exist without the right to privacy because politicians and the corporations that finance their political campaigns inevitably use their wealth and power to spy, manipulate, and sabotage their citizens and customers. These assaults on democracy and human liberty are only possible when politicians and corporations are given the power to violate our right to privacy. Gini protects your privacy.\\\" And what about fixing the broken system? \\\"All the problems discussed in the book are only possible when giant corporations and governments collude against the best interests of their citizens,\\\" says Eanfar. \\\"This is the essence of broken capitalism and broken democracy on Earth today. Gini provides solutions.\\\" All book proceeds go to the nonprofit Gini Foundation. Visit GiniFoundation.org to learn more.

Speaking in the Parliament on Friday night on the Increase In BorrowingTreasury Notes Act, Imbert questioned what was being put in place to assist people who lived off their savings and are being destroyed by the low interest rates. He said Minister of Finance Larry Howai was looking at an economic boom in the future but the present situation was very important as well. I am talking about now, when people cannot survive on $500 and $1,000 interest on their savings when in the past they were getting $5,000 and $6,000 a month, they could survive. That is the kind of monetary and fiscal policy I would like to hear brought to this House. Policies from the government to deal with decent incomes for retirees and people who live on savings, Mr Speaker, and how the Central Bank can work with the Ministry of Finance on a fiscal and monetary policy to assist the people who have fixed incomes in this country, he said. Imbert added that he saw no reason for the current Act before the Parliament, adding that the Minister of Finance had not explained what advice he has gotten from the Central Bank on it. We cannot support this, we see no need for this, we call on the minister to forget this and bring a motion to this House discussing the economy of Trinidad and Tobago, the problem of under-employment in Trinidad and Tobago, the problem of increasing transfers and subsidies, the weakness of the economy, the anaemia that is inherent in our financial system and the problems of people who are on fixed saving are struggling everyday with their meagre savings and their anaemic returns on their investments how are they going to live that is what I want to discuss, he said. Minister of Education Dr Tim Gopeesingh, who spoke directly after Imbert, argued that the Government cannot interfere with the monetary policies of the Governor of the Central Bank but they are in sync with the Central Bank which has maintained an accommodative monitoring policy stance. He said: We are indeed very concerned about the plight of our senior citizens whose lifelong earnings are put into banks and right now they cannot get the type of interest rates that they can live off these interest rates. We are very concerned about that, Mr Speaker, and we are very concerned about the lending rate and the deposit rate. And we have a responsible Minister of Finance who I am sure is going to address that with the Central Bank Governor and look at the spread between the lending rate and the borrowing rate and hes going to work to ensure that the interest rates for some of our senior citizens who have some fixed deposits and living off that will be addressed. In 2013, we project overall Gross Domestic Product growth of about one-and-a-half per cent the non-energy sector should register growth of 2.5 per cent. With credit demands still low, the Central Bank continues to mop up the considerable excess liquidity in the system through voluntary term deposits, exactly what the Minister of Finance has come to the Parliament to ask for. The Central Bank Governor has asked that Ministry of Finance effect resolutions so that we can have more borrowings for the treasury notes and the T Bills. Gopeesingh added that the Central Bank review conducted for 2013 shows the positive fiscal effects for 2013 include overall increase in growth in the economy, and that it was expected it to increase by 1.6 per cent in 2013 in comparison to the 1.2 per cent in 2012 with an overall growth of 2.5 per cent in the non-petroleum sector. He said for the first time the country is experiencing a 2.5 per cent growth in the non-petroleum sector and a growth in the energy sector of 45 per cent. And according to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2013, Trinidad and Tobago is now in the category of innovation-driven economies among the most developed group of countries in the world. This comes on the heels of the countrys graduation to developed country status. The OECD has classified us as graduating to developed-country status. And a UN classification of Trinidad and Tobago is a country of high human development, this is where we are poised now, he said.

The Human Race is the second in a Trilogy to be presented by these two gifted artists.

The Normans' intricate mix of fashion and costume brings a fresh take on mas and is definitely attracting masqueraders. The Human Race is about coming out of the waters and onto the land, with the designers using a classic sporting tradition (horse racing) as an analogy for Life's Race. The theme is based on the principles of self belief and ultimately forging one's own destiny. Costumes revealed were Victory-The Jockey, The Starting Gate, and Onlooker at the Gate.

This is the dilemma that faces international diplomacy when a government turns the forces of State might against its own citizens: political self-interest versus humanitarian interest. In 1983 Trinidad and Tobago faced this question when the Maurice Bishop-led People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada imploded. How do we assist And on what terms The issue was settled with the military intervention of the United States which triggered a major controversy over national sovereignty, Caricom as a regional force, and the humanitarian responsibilities of neighbours. Today, the dilemma facing international diplomacy involves Syria where the confrontation between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government forces has escalated to the level of civil war with fatal and catastrophic consequences for the country and its people. According to the Red Cross, over 17,000 people have been killed since March last year. Collateral damage in terms of property, human hardship and industrial and economic collapse is incalculable As in the case of the other uprisings of the Arab Spring, the Syria crisis was sparked by a people's hope for change, only to be met with the full fire-power of an authoritarian regime that refuses to be challenged. While the world watched, the al-Assad regime dug in its heels and issued the order for a full military response, intent on avoiding the fate of Mubarak in Egypt and Gadaffi in Libya. Yesterday, in the country's largest city, Aleppo, military planes were said to be strafing civilians on the streets as hundreds of thousands packed their bundles and fled the city with their lives. What irony that such open bloodshed could be taking place on the same planet where just across the English Channel, the zenith of human excellence is being celebrated. How ironic, too, that the very superpowers that agree to ascribe to the highest values of the Olympic Games cannot rise above narrow self-interest to find common ground for a solution to the Syrian crisis. As in Libya, the war between the government and people of Syria is now a fight to the finish. Both sides are committed to battling to the end.

All the groups except the Public Defender were allowed in the case with full rights of participation. \\u201cThis is truly a David and Goliath situation, requiring me to respond to not only the government's, but also the religious groups' arguments,\\u201d says Mr. Tomlinson. The legal challenge, which is supported by the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and AIDS-Free World, argues that Jamaica's anti-sodomy law violates the constitutional rights of its people. The religious groups allege that they must participate in the case to defend the 1864 British colonially imposed anti-sodomy law that criminalizes all forms of intimacy between consenting adult males, even in private, because the statute protects their rights under the 2011 Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. These rights they claim include freedom of religion, equality before the law, the right to a healthy environment, and the right to privacy. They also claim that gay men must be banned from having sex because that will inevitably lead to the exploitation of children. \\u201cDuring the hearing of the applications, the court stated that some of the churches' allegations seem far-fetched. Nevertheless, the court found that the opinion of the majority of Jamaicans \\u2014 as reflected by the religious groups \\u2014 was important in deciding what two consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedrooms,\\u201d says Mr. Tomlinson, asserting that the law violates his rights to privacy and non-discrimination. There are other serious concerns with the anti-sodomy law. UNAIDS and other groups involved in the national HIV response have identified the law as contributing to the reason Jamaica has the highest HIV prevalence rate among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the western hemisphere, if not the world (33%). MSM are driven underground and away from effective HIV prevention, treatment, care and support interventions. The Public Defender has indicated that she will seek leave to appeal the court's ruling and the matter will likely be suspended until that appeal is heard. The full hearing is not expected to take place before 2017. BACKGROUND Maurice Tomlinson is a Jamaican attorney-at-law, law lecturer and human rights activist. He has also been a leading gay rights and HIV activist in the Caribbean for over 20 years. On December 10 last year, Tomlinson filed a claim in the Jamaican Supreme Court of Judicature, challenging the country's 1864 British colonial Sodomy Law, which criminalising \\u201cbuggery\\u201d and other consensual sex between men, as violating numerous rights guaranteed in Jamaica's constitution.

As the government in Havana was completing arrangements to host this week's second summit of the Community of Latin Ameri- can and Caribbean States (CELAC), Amnesty International issued a call last Wednesday for the Obama administration to \\\"end its human rights hypocrisy\\\" by the much-unfulfilled promise to close the base as a detention centre for political prisoners without a court trial. Amnesty rebuked the US president for dishonouring his own expressed commitment of five years ago, on January 22, 2009, to issue an \\\"executive order\\\" for the closure of Guantanamo as a detention centre and arrange for court trials in the USA for prisoners, declaring in a media statement from London, England: \\\"Five years later, this promise of change has become a human rights failure that threatens to haunt President Obama's legacy, just as it has his predecessor's (former president George W Bush), according to Erika Guevara Rosas, direc- tor of Amnesty International's Americas Programme. After a dozen years in detention since the first of hundreds of political prisoners were brought to Guantanamo\\u2014\\\"strapped down in planes like cargo\\\", said Amnesty\\u2014more than 150 men are still there, most of them without charge or trial, with a few subjected to trial \\\"under a military commission system that does not meet international fair trial standards\\u2026\\\". Last year, Cuba, which has been protesting since its 1959 revolution the US military presence at Guantanamo (which is part of Cuban territory), reminded a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council that the torture of political prisoners at the naval base has been internationally condemned. The continuing US military occupation of Guantanamo and its misuse as a detention centre for political prisoners without legitimate court trials is expected to surface among issues to be addressed during this week's two-day CELAC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday in Havana. Prior to the summit of heads of state and govern- ment, a two-day regional forum comprising foreign ministers and national experts from various sectors is scheduled, the first of which was to begin yesterday. Caribbean Community (Caricom) Secretary General Irwin LaRocque, who will be among participants, said in our brief telephone conversation that he expects \\\"a significant presence\\\" from the 15-member community for the CELAC summit. He pointed out the Caribbean region was actively involved from the inception in the cre- ation of the hemispheric body. Among the distinguished, special guests to be greeted by Cuban President Raoul Castro will be UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and the Secretary General of the Organisation of American States (OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza. Established in 2011 in Caracas as an initiative of the now late president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, CELAC has defined itself as \\\"a counterpart of the OAS\\\". It held its first formal summit in 2013 in Santiago, Chile, the outgoing chair, now to be succeeded by Cuba. A distinguishing feature of CELAC from the OAS is both the USA and Canada have not been considered for membership at the time of conception of its formation. The CELAC summit in Ha- vana will mark the first ever official visit by an OAS secre- tary general to Cuba which, under US pressures follow- ing the Fidel Castro-led revo- lution of 1959, had been excluded from membership\\u2014 a position the Caribbean island state has since showed no interest in regaining. Cuba's deputy Foreign Minister, Abelardo Moreno, in briefing the media on the CELAC summit, said he was optimistic it would \\\"yield very positive results for Latin America and the Carib- bean\\\", consistent with shared objectives in the strengthen- ing of co-operation for deep- ening integration. Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago was designated as \\\"Guest Country of Honour\\\" for this year's \\\"Cubadisco Music Festival\\\", which takes place in Havana from May 17-25.

The Human Race is about coming out of the waters and onto the land, with the designers using a classic sporting tradition (horse racing) as an analogy for Life's Race. The theme is based on the principles of self belief and ultimately forging one's own destiny. Costumes revealed were Victory-The Jockey, The Starting Gate, and Onlooker at the Gate.

On Saturday at the NGC Bocas Lit Fest in a special discussion event, Chief Justice Ivor Archie will join a diverse panel, which includes attorney Lynette Seebaran-Suite, chair of the Equal Opportunity Commission; human rights activist Nazma Muller; and columnist and former United Nations officer Elizabeth Solomon. Veteran broadcaster Julian Rogers will moderate the session, which begins at 10 a.m. at the National Library in Port of Spain. Running this year from last Saturday to this Sunday, the NGC Bocas Lit Fest is celebrated for presenting the work of poets, novelists, and other creative writers, but the festival also includes what its organisers describe as \\u201ccarefully curated discussion panels that bring together some of our most distinguished and insightful thinkers in a rigorous but non-political setting, for high-level conversation on the questions of the day.\\u201d In past years, these have included discussions on such topics as the consequences of Independence, press freedom, the problem of crime, and the role of sports in developing societies. \\u201cAt its heart,\\u201d says Bocas programme director Nicholas Laughlin, \\u201cthe festival is a forum for open, intelligent conversation about the most pressing concerns facing our national and regional community \\u2014 usually through the medium of literature, but also attending to broader public interests.\\u201d Titled \\u201cWelcome to the 21st Century\\u201d, this year's human rights panel has a special focus on how T&T's laws and systems of justice are keeping up with \\u2014 or lagging behind \\u2014 changing social circumstances and mores. In the past, Chief Justice Archie and his fellow panellists have all been vocal about needed reforms, but how and when is that to be achieved The Bocas debate is inspired by a statement made earlier this year by PNM chairman Franklin Khan, who spoke about the need for the government and society at large to take a 21st-century approach to contentious issues such as gender rights and sexual orientation. More recently, Attorney General, Faris Al-Rawi has highlighted the unacceptable state of affairs with regard to people held without trial. The 2016 NGC Bocas Lit Fest, Trinidad and Tobago's annual festival of words, stories, and ideas, includes well over 100 other events, from readings and discussion panels to films and workshops. The schedule is available online at bocaslitfest.com. There is a free weekday park and ride service from the Savannah Grand Stand to the National Library. The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago is title sponsor of the 2016 festival, First Citizens is the lead sponsor, and One Caribbean Media and the Ministry of Planning and Development are main sponsors. Other sponsors are the Massy Foundation and The University of the West Indies.

(See Page 27) In its just-released 2010 TIP Report, the US State Department has gone further, blaming governments for failing to provide required \\\"comprehensive data'' during the reporting period. The 2010 report links Jamaica's scourge of trafficking in persons (largely women and girls forced into prostitution in tourist areas) with the operations of drug lords in so-called \\\"garrison'' communities. (See Page 28) Tivoli Gardens, domain \\\"don'' Christopher \\\"Dudus'' Cokecurrently on the run from the lawis one such TIP area. Release of the 2010 report has also coincided with last week's passage of legislation in Antigua and Barbuda to deal with the illegal trade in humans. Prior to last week's passage of TIP law the US sharply criticised Antigua and Barbuda over the problem. In its editorial yesterday headlined, \\\"Caribbean's Challenge in Human Trade'', the Barbados Daily Nation noted that TIP \\\"has long been recognised as a serious anti-crime agenda driven by the US under successive Washington administrations in keeping with expressed concerns for their own as well as hemispheric security interests...'' The Guyana government lost no time in going on the offensive on Monday against the US State Department, using undiplomatic language to dismiss the 2010 report in reference to that Caricom state as sheer \\\"eye-pass\\\" (creolese for insult); \\\"crap'' and \\\"diatribe''. The angry words flowed at a hastily-called press briefing, organised by Dr Roger Luncheon, head of the Presidential Secretariat and Cabinet Secretary. Three cabinet ministers present were the Ministers of Human Services and Social Security (Priya Manickchand), Home Affairs (Clement Rohee) and Education (Sheik Baksh). One of the reasons for Guyana's anger, as reported from the media briefing, was an unsubstantiated claim in the US report that approximately 984 children were removed from exploitative child labour between 2005 to 2009 Luncheon claimed there was \\\"something sinister'' in the alleged \\\"findings'' that contrasted with the government's own report on ongoing efforts to deal with cases of human trafficking. Foreign Minister Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, who was among participants at last week's meeting in Barbados of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Caribbean foreign ministers, has been authorised to immediately lodge a formal protest with the US and seek an explanation on inaccuracies in the TIP report that \\\"hurts (Guyana/US) friendship''. TIP reports from the US State Department generally make claims of criminal networks that involve forced prostitution of women, girls and boys, as well as exploitation of child labour. The report also engages in a policy of selective category ratings of governments' responses to the challenges of trafficking in persons a sickening worldwide human tragedy. Both Jamaica and Guyana are currently on the US so-called \\\"Tier-2'' category rating, indicating a positive but still inadequate response (as pre-determined by the American authorities) in dealing with human trafficking. Guyana's Minister of Human Services and Social Security is, however, not only questioning the rationale of the ratings category but feels that an appropriate apology from Washington is necessary. In providing an overview at Monday's media briefing of her government's ongoing anti-TIP programme, the minister argued that there is no justification for this rating for Guyana and the report should be \\\"withdrawn with an apology...'' In view of recurring controversial claims in US State Department reports on the trade in humans in the Caribbean as well as over illicit drugs and trafficking in small arms, it is to be expected that these problems will be addressed at next month's Caricom Heads of Government Conference in Montego Bay, Jamaica, moreso in the context of what was pursued in Barbados last Thursday with Secretary of State Clinton on \\\"Caribbean-US Dialogue on Security Co-operation''. Since the Prime Minister of T&T normally shoulders lead responsibility for crime and security among Caricom Heads of Government, it is to be assumed that there will be updates in the agenda folder being prepared in connection with Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar's journey to Montego Bay.

(See Page 27) In its just-released 2010 TIP Report, the US State Department has gone further, blaming governments for failing to provide required \\\"comprehensive data'' during the reporting period. The 2010 report links Jamaica's scourge of trafficking in persons (largely women and girls forced into prostitution in tourist areas) with the operations of drug lords in so-called \\\"garrison'' communities. (See Page 28) Tivoli Gardens, domain \\\"don'' Christopher \\\"Dudus'' Cokecurrently on the run from the lawis one such TIP area. Release of the 2010 report has also coincided with last week's passage of legislation in Antigua and Barbuda to deal with the illegal trade in humans. Prior to last week's passage of TIP law the US sharply criticised Antigua and Barbuda over the problem. In its editorial yesterday headlined, \\\"Caribbean's Challenge in Human Trade'', the Barbados Daily Nation noted that TIP \\\"has long been recognised as a serious anti-crime agenda driven by the US under successive Washington administrations in keeping with expressed concerns for their own as well as hemispheric security interests...'' The Guyana government lost no time in going on the offensive on Monday against the US State Department, using undiplomatic language to dismiss the 2010 report in reference to that Caricom state as sheer \\\"eye-pass\\\" (creolese for insult); \\\"crap'' and \\\"diatribe''. The angry words flowed at a hastily-called press briefing, organised by Dr Roger Luncheon, head of the Presidential Secretariat and Cabinet Secretary. Three cabinet ministers present were the Ministers of Human Services and Social Security (Priya Manickchand), Home Affairs (Clement Rohee) and Education (Sheik Baksh). One of the reasons for Guyana's anger, as reported from the media briefing, was an unsubstantiated claim in the US report that approximately 984 children were removed from exploitative child labour between 2005 to 2009 Luncheon claimed there was \\\"something sinister'' in the alleged \\\"findings'' that contrasted with the government's own report on ongoing efforts to deal with cases of human trafficking. Foreign Minister Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, who was among participants at last week's meeting in Barbados of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Caribbean foreign ministers, has been authorised to immediately lodge a formal protest with the US and seek an explanation on inaccuracies in the TIP report that \\\"hurts (Guyana/US) friendship''. TIP reports from the US State Department generally make claims of criminal networks that involve forced prostitution of women, girls and boys, as well as exploitation of child labour. The report also engages in a policy of selective category ratings of governments' responses to the challenges of trafficking in persons a sickening worldwide human tragedy. Both Jamaica and Guyana are currently on the US so-called \\\"Tier-2'' category rating, indicating a positive but still inadequate response (as pre-determined by the American authorities) in dealing with human trafficking. Guyana's Minister of Human Services and Social Security is, however, not only questioning the rationale of the ratings category but feels that an appropriate apology from Washington is necessary. In providing an overview at Monday's media briefing of her government's ongoing anti-TIP programme, the minister argued that there is no justification for this rating for Guyana and the report should be \\\"withdrawn with an apology...'' In view of recurring controversial claims in US State Department reports on the trade in humans in the Caribbean as well as over illicit drugs and trafficking in small arms, it is to be expected that these problems will be addressed at next month's Caricom Heads of Government Conference in Montego Bay, Jamaica, moreso in the context of what was pursued in Barbados last Thursday with Secretary of State Clinton on \\\"Caribbean-US Dialogue on Security Co-operation''. Since the Prime Minister of T&T normally shoulders lead responsibility for crime and security among Caricom Heads of Government, it is to be assumed that there will be updates in the agenda folder being prepared in connection with Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar's journey to Montego Bay.

Your questions answered \", \"DATE\": \"Apr 23, 2019 \", \"CONTENT\": \"(BPT) - April marks an important anniversary for genome-related discoveries; in April 1953, DNA\\u2019s double helix was discovered by Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin and fifty years later in April 2003, the Human Genome Project \\u2014 an international research project that determined the sequence of the human genome and identified the genes that it contains \\u2014 was completed. DNA carries all genetic instructions for the human body and almost all humans have the same genes arranged in the same order, with more than 99.5 percent of their DNA sequence in common. But it is the few differences in the base pairs \\u2014 somewhere around 4 to 5 million of them \\u2014 that make us unique, and can help uncover your family history and ethnic origins. Thanks to the scientific discoveries historically made this month, and continued developments in the study of DNA, it\\u2019s now increasingly accessible to discover more about your ethnic origins and even connect with relatives through consumer DNA testing. Barry Starr, director of scientific communications at Ancestry, the global leader in family history and consumer genomics, answers some of the top questions about DNA tests: Will I have different DNA results than my sibling? Yes, almost certainly. You get about 50 percent of your DNA from your mom and 50 percent from your dad. But you and your siblings did not inherit the same 50 percent from each parent, so you are both going to receive different \\u2018bits\\u2019 of DNA from each parent (unless you\\u2019re an identical twin). It\\u2019s why siblings\\u2019 looks and personalities can vary. If you\\u2019re genetic siblings, you\\u2019ll match in a DNA network as being a very close family connection, but your ethnicity estimates are likely to differ. How come my DNA results differ from what my family has told me? Even family historians, with lots of stories, photos and extensive family trees going back centuries, can be surprised by a DNA test. This is because DNA tests can uncover insights from hundreds to over 1,000 years ago that aren\\u2019t in historical records \\u2014 things you might never have known otherwise. Who owns my DNA and data after I\\u2019ve taken a test? With AncestryDNA, you always maintain ownership and control over your own data and there are technical, administrative, and physical safeguards in place to protect personal information. For example, customers\\u2019 personal data is encrypted and segmented to separate, dedicated access-controlled storage platforms, and no common identifiers are stored with any genetic data. Ancestry does not share any personal or DNA data with insurers, employers, or third-party marketers. How can my DNA results change over time? Genomics is advancing rapidly, and improvements in science and the methodology of DNA analysis can give more precise results. Your DNA doesn\\u2019t change but the science behind interpreting it does, and results may be updated as the analysis becomes more accurate.

Some however, called for more trained officers and we wondered how this gap would be filled. Consequently, the Chamber supports the minister's conduct of a Human Resource Audit. We are aware that the sanctioned strength of the Service is 7,000, of which there is an existing shortfall of about 1,000 officers and less than 5,000 are in fact at the service of the people at any one time. Why is that so In the Chamber's opinion, the proposed audit must answer this question. It must tell us how many are on medical leave, for example, the abuse and misuse of which has been severely criticised by Acting Police Commissioner James Philbert. We must be told how many are on study leave and out of the country, what is their course of study and whether or not this enhances performance of their duties. The taxpayer must be told how many are not actively engaged in police work and enjoying casual leave, duty leave, special leave, light duty, paternity or bereavement leave, leave of absence or attending courts. The Chamber also recalls that some time ago, Mr Philbert was compelled to cancel duty and special leave for those team members representing the Service in sporting, educational and cultural events because of its exigencies, much to the disgust of members. The audit must inform Minister Sandy as to the Police Force's recruitment and training needs, not only to meet everyday requirements, but also those to energise his latest plan and with some surplus to address the same exigencies. It should guide him on the number of former law enforcement officers he must re-employ, a possible buyout of and reduction in leave entitlement and identify the many posts in the Service which could just as competently be filled by trained civilians, as he plans to do. Above all, it must justify the return of the Police Service to a shift system of three eight-hour periods per day, with no overtime, similar to employees of the Port Authority some years ago. The crisis in the crime situation demands nothing less, as our former president Frank Mouttet, pointed out to Minister Sandy, when he fielded questions from the recent audience. Minister Sandy must also let us know whether the contention by another member of the audience that for the islandwide radar tracking system to be effective, each boat in our waters which carries no communication equipment, must be outfitted with a radar reflector, for reliable tracing of registration. Minister Sandy must also tell us whether or not the suggestion will bring an increased level of success in detection of illegal activities by coastal patrols. It appears to the Chamber that when these maritime initiatives are taken together with Minister Sandy's plan to partner with private sector security companies under the umbrella of the Estate Police Network Commission, thereby utilising the eyesight and hearing of 20,000 of their officers on duty to improve intelligence gathering, the combination is bound to yield handsome returns. Let's see how law enforcement capitalises on this surfeit of intelligence, in harmony with what already emerges from Crime Stoppers, the air ship and CCTV. The Chamber is pleased to note that the minister's plan also takes on board our oft repeated observation concerning greater conspicuity, more mobile and foot patrols, stop and search exercises, zero tolerance of road traffic offences and community policing. A sustained campaign with such components is bound to give a boost to the waning public confidence in the Police Service and strangle the ease of mobility which criminal elements now enjoy. Minister Sandy made it quite clear to us that he is passionate about our youth and the quality of their future life. The Chamber too, shares these concerns and commends his Ministry's Citizens' Security Programme under the leadership of Gregory Sloane-Seale. Its philosophies and targets within the 22 communities are directed at the young minds, their families and spare time upon which gangs are likely to prey. We cannot ignore the social consequences of crime and the attraction presented by depressed and underdeveloped communities. The Ministries of Education, the People and Multiculturalism must partner and support the Ministry of National Security in executing and widening this programme to include all of Trinidad and Tobago outside of the 22 communities, bringing on board and resourcing our faith based organisations and projects like the Pride in Gonzales, to improve the lot of our communities and snuff out the cycle of crime. The Chamber wishes Minister Sandy the very best of success with this latest plan. The plan appears to be simple, logical and universal. However, time is not on the side of the law abiding. In fact, those who have not yet been victims or know those that have been, continue to live on borrowed time. The \\\"rate of interest\\\" is high and \\\"the loan\\\" is in arrears. Crime is beckoning our youth and the underprivileged every day and we cannot wait, lest more and more choose to answer that call out of desperation.

We disagree, however, with the prescription that Caricom is always a solution to advancing T&T's citizens' interests in global capitals. Indeed, Caricom has forced how the region engages globally on norms and accountability for the very issues the Express names to the lowest common denominator among the region's leaders. Time and again in international forums, we see the interests and rights of T&T's women and LGBTI people held hostage by Caricom to a standard far lower than our domestic politics allows, in the name of regional unity. And Caricom in turn collaborates with the most conservative global blocs to water down international agreements on sexual and reproductive rights.

This prayer is respect for life in our nation. As you know, this is what I believe to be the fundamental root challenge that is facing us\\u2014a culture of disrespect which is all-pervasive. The root of this challenge is spiritual. All the major religions observe the golden rule\\u2014do unto others as you would have them do unto you. This golden thread runs through all the major religions, and binds humanity together in an interdependent ecosystem. My good is dependent upon the good of others. My growth is dependent on the growth of others. My flourishing is dependent upon the flourishing of others. This fundamental spiritual law is the basic foundation for humanity. Without this foundation, we cannot build a sustainable civilisation where people flourish. This is the deep challenge facing Trinidad and Tobago today. We want to flourish without ensuring all others flourish. It cannot happen! Rugged individualism with its exaggerated push for human freedom has taken us to the brink of the precipice. At this existential edge of human decency, we now have very difficult decisions to make. What type of civilisation do we want to build in Trinidad and Tobago? What type of people do we want to become? Looking at the golden rule it seems very simple\\u2014do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It may even seem self-interested. At its heart, it is being other-focused. If you want a good life you need to limit your freedoms. You need to treat others as you want to be treated. You need to ensure others have what you dream for and aspire towards. You need to ensure all citizens in our nation have access to the dreams and aspirations that you have. You need to live exaggerated responsibility. It is from this understanding that we begin to understand the root of our interconnectedness. Here in the Catholic tradition we speak about the common good, the good that we must all seek and work for if we are all to flourish. The group 3Canal captured this in \\u201cGood Morning, Neighbour\\u201d. They say: \\u201cI have a little remedy, a guaranteed philosophy to make this a better place, healing for the human race\\u201d. Their remedy is for us to be neighbourly to each other, to acknowledge each other as human beings, and to engage each other and recognise the humanity and dignity of the other. In South Africa they say ubuntu. Generally, it means humanity. It is translated, \\u201cI am because you are.\\u201d This lays the foundation for building a civilisation. The building blocks are not pitch, oil or concrete and steel. It is the quality of relationships among citizens. It is the interdependence that we understand in our striving for excellence and growth. My existence and happiness are dependent upon yours. This is a different foundation from our current foundation in Trinidad and Tobago. There is a Yoruba proverb that says: \\u201cOne who is going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on himself to feel how it hurts.\\u201d Placed in the negative it puts forward the point very well. Your actions to others should be tested on yourself first. In Hinduism the text from the Taittiriya Upanishad, reads: \\u201cThose acts that you consider good when done to you, do those to others, none else\\u201d (Shikshavalli, Eleventh Anuvaka). We go after \\u201cwhat we can get\\u201d, or rather \\u201cwhat\\u2019s in it for me\\u201d (WIIFM). We put the \\u2018I\\u2019 and the needs and desires of the self at centre. This putting self at centre is opposed to all religious traditions, and thus opposed to all ways of being in relationship with God. Trinidad and Tobago is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious community. Our largest traditions are Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. We have many other traditions also that make up this incredible place. We also have humanists and atheists in our land who do not believe in God but we all share a common humanity. We all occupy the 5,131 km2. We need to understand that my happiness is dependent upon your happiness. I want to ask every citizen to consider the golden rule. The fact that the golden rule transcends culture, religions and belief, suggests it is a moral code written into the fabric of who we are\\u2014our DNA. By definition, prayer turns us outwards after leading us inward, away from our self towards the Other: the wholly Other, God! By this turn of mind and consciousness, we create a new foundation for our entire being. I am not the foundation of my being. I did not bring myself into being, I am not the origin, and I am not the end. There is one who is greater than me who brought everything into being. I am surrendering to this One. I seek communion with this One. I want to know, love and serve this One. By turning from self, we change the basic proposition of our national consciousness. It is no longer about \\u2018me\\u2019. It is about God! This is the first step in our religious conversion. The death of a former Petrotrin worker last month by his own hands, attributed by relatives and the union to his inability to cope with loss of his job, has re-focused attention on the Government\\u2019s inadequate impact assessment and post-closure services to workers prior to the dramatic folding of the State company. IS it that the Government is powerless to treat with the rise in home invasions, robberies and murders? In order to fight crime, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service should be efficiently resourced with modern, state-of-the art equipment. Let us face it, the nation is a great mess and the majority of our citizens deserve this because of the political party and politicians they support. They, like Government politicians, do nothing whatsoever to try to put our deliberate adverse situation and worsening condition right. LIKE most Trinbagonains, everything I know about the political policies of the People\\u2019s Republic of China comes from the Jackie Chan movie The Tuxedo. So I was quite surprised to learn about the current fate of one of China\\u2019s ethnic minorities; the Uighurs. Concacaf (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football) dream killers would destroy the spirit of what World Cup football stands for, if not stopped. Around Emancipation Day, I\\u2019m struck by two contrasting views on Haiti. First, there\\u2019s huge respect for the historic Haiti where Toussaint L\\u2019Ouverture led a slave revolt against the French to victory in 1804.

They will be meeting with President Danilo Medina Sanchez. On September 23, the Constitutional Court of the DR stripped citizenship from immigrants entering the country since 1929 and that of their offspring. Antoine also said she was especially concerned about the rights of Haitian children. Earlier yesterday, she had attended the launch of the UWI/Family Development Centre (FDC) in St Augustine, yesterday. The launch, which highlighted the acrylic paintings done by 22 children, coincided with Universal Childrens Day. Via a telephone interview, Antoine said: The situation must be extreme for the entire commission to go into the DR. The recent constitutional decision on citizenship in relation to the DR is of special interest to us. We have jurisprudence. We have decided cases on this issue. And this latest decision is concerned about the disproportionate impact on people of Haitian descent. Antoine added: The move is in harmony with the United Nations Committee on Refugees. They use our case law to substantiate their own work. We are in sync with other international human rights bodies. When we meet, we will issue a statement. Antoine said the recent developments were nothing new. The focus was on people living there and not migrants. She added: In our case, the Dominican Court has already found human rights violations of discrimination since 2005 against people of Haitian descent living there. It is not about migrants. It is about people born in the Dominican Republic. It is about their rights and citizenship. It is about the retroactive revocation of citizenship going back to 1929. That decision says it could be taken away from you. And people could be rendered stateless. It is about taking away peoples citizenship. It is not about people who are coming in and they have been born in the state of the Dominican Republic Sharing her sentiments on the status of children, Antoine said: It is of interest on the rights of children. In 2005, we know there are special protections on the part of the state towards children. This is of grave impact to human rights. It is very important to the Caribbean. We can make analogies where we have the status of Guyanese and when we have people born in a particular Caribbean country. What is the future of Haitians in Bahamas What is the general status of Haitians Antoine added: Haitians were denied their birth certificates. If you dont have a birth certificate, you are not entitled to education and health. It has now boiled over. It is an unfair and horrific situation. To date, Antoine has been writing her own history.

The point was well made in yesterday\\u2019s Express by columnist David Jessop, who admonished the Trinidad and Tobago Government for \\u201cmoving at a pace that seems blind to the impending human tsunami\\u201d in regularising the status of Venezuelan refugees and asylum seekers. To this country\\u2019s shame, he cited the Red Cross report of February 1 which raises deep concerns about the health and physical security of the estimated 40,000-plus who fled here, only to be subjected to \\u201cstigma and discrimination, with acts of resentment regarding employment and access to health services further threatening their security\\u201d. Little did the Red Cross know that much worse was to come. Last week, Trinidad and Tobago made ugly headlines following the police rescue of 19 Venezuelan girls believed to have been trafficked as sex slaves. All were teenagers, some of them children as young as 15. For months this newspaper has been urging the Government to adopt a humanitarian approach towards the refugees, including those who arrive illegally. Instead of considering the implications of the human disaster, Government officials stuck to the very immigration laws that they had committed to change by signing UN refugee conventions and protocols. In language and tone, the Government\\u2019s position, including its deportation of refugees who had filed for asylum, fed the stigma, discrimination and acts of resentment picked up by the Red Cross. Women, including mothers with children, were arrested and taken to court. Some were jailed. This was the atmosphere which made refugees so vulnerable to exploitation that, following the police rescue of the 19 girls, the authorities reported an overload of information from persons claiming to have information on similar cases of exploitation throughout the country. Now that the Venezuelan political crisis has galloped beyond Trinidad and Tobago\\u2019s interest in the Dragon Field gas deal, we must adopt a clear-eyed position on this humanitarian disaster. Declaring a position of non-interference in the politics of Venezuelan in no way prevents Trinidad and Tobago from providing protection, safety and support for those who come to T&T in their moment of greatest need. This is no ordinary problem of illegal migrants to be handled in an ordinary manner. T&T has on its hands a crisis requiring an urgent and imaginative response guided by leadership with the expertise and moral authority to get all relevant agencies and entities to work together in the best interest of the refugees and our country. While NGOs like Living Water Community continue to provide outstanding service, the refugee problem cannot simply be outsourced. A national crisis of this scope requires national leadership by the Government. As Jessop has warned, the decision by the Maduro government to block humanitarian supplies from entering Venezuela could become the flashpoint for an even more dangerous escalation that could send more refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries, including T&T. Having made our position on the political crisis known to the world through Caricom let us now focus on the Venezuelan problem unfolding right here at home. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months.

Can I have a Digicel card for 20 (twen-tee) please I asked the counter attendant. I would have said may, but I did not want to seem too formal; somehow many here always get offended when I speak correctly, so I try to tone it down (shakes head as I think about it). I should have used it here though, for this individual was different. There is hope yet! Sure, of course, he responded and walked over to the machine to get the card. Upon noticing that I was carrying a couple of books in hand, he asked, what are you studying I responded, Actually, Im a teacher. What subject English. He blurted out, Oh my! So you have like 1.6 billion people throughout Trinidad and Tobago to teach Standard English! I started laughing, as did a male friend of his who was in the store at the time. I think testosterone is overvalued in this country, he continued. A lot of men come in here and they act all macho and I cant even understand what it is theyre saying sometimes; for instance, umgimmeh ah At this point, he ruffled the rest of his words. Sometimes, they dont even know the name of the part that they came in here for. Why is it that men feel that speaking Standard English is a bad thing, and that in order to be a man-man they must speak badly It felt as if he was on a tirade, so annoyed was he by the poor English of many. He continued, Im sure this will come as no surprise to you, but you are not tall, white, blonde, etc., but when you open your mouth and you speak, its like, oh my goodness! At this point, he begins to playfully move around the store in an excited manner, moving his hands about as if to say, oh my God, Im so impressed; Im blown away! He went on, Perhaps you can lead a group of students on a walkabout throughout Port-of-Spain, take them to the different businesses so that they can see how successful people speak; perhaps you and I can collaborate on this. You see, people dont realise that speaking well actually increases your stature in this life The poor thing! I feel his pain, I really do. Like it does me, the poor English of many here sears his soul. But what I find interesting about this conversation are his statements on most men here and their belief that speaking Standard English somehow makes them less male. Why do some men hold this belief I believe it goes back to the following popular Mother Goose nursery rhyme for children, What are Little Boys Made of. The rhyme is posted on rhymes.org.uk: What are little boys made of Snips and snails, and puppy dog tails, That's what little boys are made of. What are little girls made of Sugar and spice, and everything nice, That's what little girls are made of. In other words, some females tend to be cultured, well-poised, dainty, well-mannered, soft-spoken and well-spoken. Some boys, on the other hand, are rough, rugged and ill-behaved; and given that speaking Standard English is associated with a cultured, well-bred and well-spoken individual (and rightfully so),some boys tend to shy away from it. This is particularly so in the black community, which is what I believe the attendant meant to get at when he made the point that I am not tall, white, blonde, etc. (his statement may be extended to the larger black community). But that is not so. Speaking well is an attribute of the cultured, the educated, the well-bred, the well-mannered (nothing is wrong with dialect when used appropriately). It is not a girl thing. Another influence on some males here that makes their situation all the more unique is the fact that there seems to be a tacit national agreement that speaking bad English is a Trini ting. A refrain my mother used to say a lot (and actually, still does) when I was growing up will help me to delineate my point. It went something like this and was often used to refer to people with questionable moralities, who attempted to impose those moralities on herself, my sister or me: they does feel everybodys the same eh! Perhaps this is why so many speak badly here and are comfortable with it, because they feel that everyones the same way. In fact, I am convinced that this is the case given the conversation between a taxi driver and a fellow passenger the other day as I was on my way home. Either the driver or passenger (I forget), was relating his experience of having to curse out someone at a ministry here to get something done. According to this individual, when he asked the clerk why is it he only get through after yelling and gettin on, the clerk responded, oh gosh, yuh know daz how Trini does get on. I may safely assume that that is how many think, too, in regards to speaking badly is ah Trini ting. Why else would they walk into a place of business and speak any old how and think it ok But it is not OK. Speaking badly is not a Trini ting. There are some Trinidadians who speak well, who speak Standard English. Speaking badly is a characteristic, often times, of the uneducated and the ill-bred; speaking well is a characteristic, often times, of the educated and the well-bred. The attendant in the auto parts store is correct. From the moment a person begins to speak, it is evident that persons stature in this life, and moreover, that persons stature may either increase or not; it is evident his or her academic background and the environment out of which he or she comes. So if a person opens their mouth and begins speaking badly, immediately, the person to whom he or she is speaking will infer that he or she is not well-educated, and quite possibly, comes from the lower classes (there are some in the lower classes who defy the norm, who understand the importance of speech, of presentation, so that my words are not misconstrued). And the person will treat you accordingly. If this individual is speaking to a potential employer, it is very likely that he or she will not be hired because the potential employer would worry that this person would be a bad representation of and a bad reflection on the company understandably so. And if a person opens their mouth and begins to speak well, immediately, the person to whom he or she is speaking will infer that he or she is well-educated, and quite possibly, comes from the middle or wealthier classes (the person may not even be from the middle or wealthier classes). And, again, the person will treat you accordingly. If this individual is speaking to a potential employer, it is very likely that he or she will be hired because the potential employer would feel confident that the individual would be a good representation of and a good reflection on the company understandably so. So men, there really is no harm in speaking well. The educated and truly respected in the country will tell you so, and laud you for it.

As we look on helplessly, we are reminded of just how dangerous the world is and why we need to cherish and protect every freedom that we have. Like others before them, the people of Syria have discovered that the world does not come running to help, unless it perceives a threat to its own interest. This is the dilemma that faces international diplomacy when a government turns the forces of State might against its own citizens: political self-interest versus humanitarian interest. In 1983 Trinidad and Tobago faced this question when the Maurice Bishop-led People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada imploded. How do we assist And on what terms The issue was settled with the military intervention of the United States which triggered a major controversy over national sovereignty, Caricom as a regional force, and the humanitarian responsibilities of neighbours. Today, the dilemma facing international diplomacy involves Syria where the confrontation between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government forces has escalated to the level of civil war with fatal and catastrophic consequences for the country and its people. According to the Red Cross, over 17,000 people have been killed since March last year. Collateral damage in terms of property, human hardship and industrial and economic collapse is incalculable As in the case of the other uprisings of the Arab Spring, the Syria crisis was sparked by a people's hope for change, only to be met with the full fire-power of an authoritarian regime that refuses to be challenged. While the world watched, the al-Assad regime dug in its heels and issued the order for a full military response, intent on avoiding the fate of Mubarak in Egypt and Gadaffi in Libya. Yesterday, in the country's largest city, Aleppo, military planes were said to be strafing civilians on the streets as hundreds of thousands packed their bundles and fled the city with their lives. What irony that such open bloodshed could be taking place on the same planet where just across the English Channel, the zenith of human excellence is being celebrated. How ironic, too, that the very superpowers that agree to ascribe to the highest values of the Olympic Games cannot rise above narrow self-interest to find common ground for a solution to the Syrian crisis. As in Libya, the war between the government and people of Syria is now a fight to the finish. Both sides are committed to battling to the end. Especially for the civilian forces, there can be no turning back. As a country that has provided succour for generations of Syrians who have found a home here, we can add our voices in support of an inventive international response to bringing peace to Syria.

The tone of our public dialogue at present on the reform of our nation's Constitution, the fundamental document that governs how we live together in this society, should be civil, respectful and exemplify our national watchword: tolerance. We must all be able to live together on these islands in harmony after this process. The media also have a critical role to play in achieving this objective and setting a compassionate tone and accurate measure. Attaching as captions such expressions that I did not use like \\\"gay rights\\\" and \\\"sexual rights\\\" served to create some confusion in the minds of readers and to detract from the main human rights gist of the presentation. Human rights are entitlements which encompass the full range of human diversity and are based on the inherent human dignity of each and every human person and form the basis of what is called the Bill of Rights as integral to modern liberal constitutions. Constitutions are regarded as fundamental law and place persons at the heart of what a nation and its development is all about. A bill of rights recognises the inherent dignity of human beings and the rights and freedoms emerging from that dignity simply by the fact of their being human. It contains entitlements with respect to persons and protects persons from encroachments from the State and from fellow citizens. In a modern democracy and especially in a multicultural society such as Trinidad and Tobago, this provision helps to manage various and ofttimes conflicting interests, setting fundamental boundaries and rules of fair play. In the Bill of Rights as obtains in our Republican Constitution of 1976 there are fundamental inalienable rights set out at Section 4 of which marriage is not regarded as a fundamental inalienable right. The term \\\"fundamental inalienable right\\\" is defined as one which a person has or to which he/she is entitled simply because of their personhood and humanity. Although my overall approach is non-discrimination for persons on the grounds of sexual orientation, this does not obligate the State to same-sex marriage in the future. In the context of the discussion I also drew on a principle of jurisprudence which ensures that the rights of a minority not suffer under the will of the majority. Such a principle of protecting minority rights and the moral perspectives secured by constitutional laws make for sober and responsible judgment on matters affecting those citizens who may suffer the indignity of discrimination. The context of the discussion that took place at UWI SPEC was a public forum by the Ministry of Legal Affairs National Consultation on Constitutional Reform. I was commenting on Chapters Two and Three which dealt with \\\"Rewording the Preamble\\\" and \\\"Fundamental Rights and Freedoms\\\" respectively. I commented on four distinct areas, all of which I considered critically important. The first was on the wording under paragraph 37 on the \\\"languaging\\\"/wording of gender terms; second, on the inclusion of the environment; third, on the recognition of God, where I supported the idea that recognition of God should be indicated by mention of God's name but also where I specifically defended the rights of atheists who should in no way be disadvantaged or prejudiced by their belief or lack of belief; and finally on part \\\"b\\\" of page 13 which reads \\\"the issue of sexual orientation and human rights should be made the subject of further national discussion and public education\\\".

What does the word mean In its broadest sense it means to be in a state of wholeness as opposed to being fragmented. The word is derived from a Latin word meaning entire or untouched. From integer there are the various derivatives of integral, integrate, integrative and of course disintegrate and disintegration. In human affairs the word integrity is accepted to mean essentially an uncompromising adherence to a code of moral or other human values, such as absolute sincerity, honesty and candour. Many consider any deceit, deception or dishonesty to be hypocrisy and the opposite of integrity. Now why should the behaviours of integrity and hypocrisy be important in human affairs Undoubtedly they are the highs and lows of human behaviour. Integrity is an expression of an acceptance of a behaviour of what is in the best interest of the common good of the group. Hypocrisy is placing self interest before collective interests of the group, even as an individual may be aware of collective benefit. The important thing to be understood about integrity is absolute adherence to some accepted code in an area of human activity. Moral codes abound in human societies, many of them originating from early religions and rulers, becoming codified in time as societies grow. Philosophically, for obvious reasons however, there are comparatively few values that one can accept as being universal. Now, what is the relevance of integrity to life in Trinidad and Tobago Of vital importance. If one seeks legal help in a matter one expects the attorney to act in your interests. Or if one buys a house, car or product, one expects the seller to be honest and there are many accepted codes. Further there is the extensive law that we have inherited as well as the law that has been passed by our Parliament that attempts to regulate general behavior in the interest of the general good for citizens. But integrity in public life is of vital importance because history has shown us that ruling classes or individuals in all societies have always more often than not put their interests above those of the general public, frequently causing considerable distress or damage of the fabric of society. We have on our books the integrity in Public Life Act 2000 replacing the earlier 1987 legislation. And while there seems to be some preoccupation with the declaration of assets little concern seems to be applied to the Code of Conduct. Moreover some of our legislators seem to have little understanding of the role of the Integrity Commission. One is reported in Hansard to have stated that the Commission was a Superior Court of Record, while another stated that a principle of natural justice was that the accuser had to prove the accusation (both were attorneys at law), both being wrong. Now there is a flurry of activity. Government claims that the existing Act is defective and proposes a number of amendments. Obviously everyone will agree that failure to declare assets in accordance with the Act is wrong and that the Commission, being the recipient of the declarations must treat all equally and be seen to do so, and take action against all who have failed to meet the requirements of the law, including the Prevention of Corruption Act. But what about complaints from the public Surely breaches of the Code of Conduct and complaints by citizens are an entirely different kettle of fish. In the Act the Commission may investigate any perceived breach on its own initiative, or, a citizen may make a written signed complaint if he/she believes that there has been a breach. In cases of breaches of the Code of Conduct it is not a matter of a \\\"criminal\\\" offence and if the Commission accepts that there has been a breach all that is required of it is that it is reported to the appropriate House of Parliament. It is then up to that House to take what action it deems necessary. In cases of complaints made it must be noted that mischievous and misleading complaints attract a serious penalty. Thus I was much surprised to learn in the recent debate that in two recent years there were only nine complaints, including two from me involving what I considered serious breaches of the Code of Conduct. Why a need for change One proposed amendment would allow me to re-submit the complaints with a sworn statement! But there is larger issue that looms. In an earlier column I expressed the view that the Integrity Commission had been fatally corrupted by the Commissioners themselves. It is now over two months that the Commission collectively resigned, something that they ought to have done months before and yet there is no Commission. But who will accept appointment now Commissioners, appointed after consultation with Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition, will face the public assumption that they are merely Manning's choices. Any complaint of any conflict of interest, even if sworn, will therefore be doomed.

The rapporteurs call upon states and other relevant actors to keep these principles in mind when responding to the aforementioned developments. 1. The right to access information held by public authorities is a fundamental human right subject to a strict regime of exceptions. The right to access to information protects the right of every person to access public information and to know what governments are doing on their behalf. It is a right that has received particular attention from the international community, given its importance to the consolidation, functioning and preservation of democratic regimes. Without the protection of this right, it is impossible for citizens to know the truth, demand accountability and fully exercise their right to political participation. National authorities should take active steps to ensure the principle of maximum transparency, address the culture of secrecy that still prevails in many countries and increase the amount of information subject to routine disclosure. 2. At the same time, the right of access to information should be subject to a narrowly tailored system of exceptions to protect overriding public and private interests such as national security and the rights and security of other persons. Secrecy laws should define national security precisely and indicate clearly the criteria which should be used in determining whether or not information can be declared secret. Exceptions to access to information on national security or other grounds should apply only where there is a risk of substantial harm to the protected interest and where that harm is greater than the overall public interest in having access to the information. In accordance with international standards, information regarding human rights violations should not be considered secret or classified. 3. Public authorities and their staff bear sole responsibility for protecting the confidentiality of legitimately classified information under their control. Other individuals, including journalists, media workers and civil society representatives, who receive and disseminate classified information because they believe it is in the public interest, should not be subject to liability unless they committed fraud or another crime to obtain the information. In addition, government \\\"whistleblowers\\\" releasing information on violations of the law, on wrongdoing by public bodies, on a serious threat to health, safety or the environment, or on a breach of human rights or humanitarian law should be protected against legal, administrative or employment-related sanctions if they act in good faith. Any attempt to impose subsequent liability on those who disseminate classified information should be grounded in previously established laws enforced by impartial and independent legal systems with full respect for due process guarantees, including the right to appeal. 4. Direct or indirect government interference in or pressure exerted upon any expression or information transmitted through any means of oral, written, artistic, visual or electronic communication must be prohibited by law when it is aimed at influencing content. Such illegitimate interference includes politically motivated legal cases brought against journalists and independent media, and blocking of websites and web domains on political grounds. Calls by public officials for illegitimate retributive action are not acceptable. 5. Filtering systems which are not end-user controlledwhether imposed by a government or commercial service providerare a form of prior censorship and cannot be justified. Corporations that provide Internet services should make an effort to ensure that they respect the rights of their clients to use the Internet without arbitrary interference. 6. Self-regulatory mechanisms for journalists have played an important role in fostering greater awareness about how to report on and address difficult and controversial subjects. Special journalistic responsibility is called for when reporting information from confidential sources that may affect valuable interests such as fundamental rights or the security of other persons. Ethical codes for journalists should therefore provide for an evaluation of the public interest in obtaining such information. Such codes can also provide useful guidance for new forms of communication and for new media organisations, which should likewise voluntarily adopt ethical best practices to ensure that the information made available is accurate, fairly presented and does not cause substantial harm to legally protected interests such as human rights. l Catalina Botero-Marino is Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

As we look on helplessly, we are reminded of just how dangerous the world is and why we need to cherish and protect every freedom that we have. Like others before them, the people of Syria have discovered that the world does not come running to help, unless it perceives a threat to its own interest. This is the dilemma that faces international diplomacy when a government turns the forces of State might against its own citizens: political self-interest versus humanitarian interest. In 1983 Trinidad and Tobago faced this question when the Maurice Bishop-led People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada imploded. How do we assist And on what terms The issue was settled with the military intervention of the United States which triggered a major controversy over national sovereignty, Caricom as a regional force, and the humanitarian responsibilities of neighbours. Today, the dilemma facing international diplomacy involves Syria where the confrontation between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government forces has escalated to the level of civil war with fatal and catastrophic consequences for the country and its people. According to the Red Cross, over 17,000 people have been killed since March last year. Collateral damage in terms of property, human hardship and industrial and economic collapse is incalculable As in the case of the other uprisings of the Arab Spring, the Syria crisis was sparked by a people's hope for change, only to be met with the full fire-power of an authoritarian regime that refuses to be challenged. While the world watched, the al-Assad regime dug in its heels and issued the order for a full military response, intent on avoiding the fate of Mubarak in Egypt and Gadaffi in Libya. Yesterday, in the country's largest city, Aleppo, military planes were said to be strafing civilians on the streets as hundreds of thousands packed their bundles and fled the city with their lives. What irony that such open bloodshed could be taking place on the same planet where just across the English Channel, the zenith of human excellence is being celebrated. How ironic, too, that the very superpowers that agree to ascribe to the highest values of the Olympic Games cannot rise above narrow self-interest to find common ground for a solution to the Syrian crisis. As in Libya, the war between the government and people of Syria is now a fight to the finish. Both sides are committed to battling to the end. Especially for the civilian forces, there can be no turning back. As a country that has provided succour for generations of Syrians who have found a home here, we can add our voices in support of an inventive international response to bringing peace to Syria.

When youre interested in doing something, you do it when it is convenient. When youre committed to something, you accept no excuses. My sister/friend Ali e-mailed me that quotation, and when I read it I knew immediately that it was going to be used here. The quotation even moved me to do some reflecting on the areas that may need more commitment from me and that is what some profound quotes/statements will do cause you to think carefully about topics that you may not have previously paid attention to. Alis accompanying note to the quotation suggested that we should be committed in all areas of our lives and I totally agree, and it raised the question of whether or not we are committed to God, family life. Some of us may be feeling a bit beaten, and so may have decided that we will just mosey on through life without any great conviction the key to commitment - about anything at all. Chances are the fear of failing keeps us uncommitted. And it would be timely to note here that the opposite of committed is lackadaisical, a word that many of us do not want to be described as being. The question of why we are not be as serious as we should be about personal growth which would include spiritual growth of course and personal improvement would definitely come up in this topic. The answers to that would vary of course, but if we should conclude today that we need to be more committed we should answer the question ourselves as it would relate to our relevant situations and take the next step. So what does it take for us to be committed Well, first we want to have something to be committed to of course hence the aforementioned recommendation. Having figured out the areas that need our commitment, we then work out a plan. Why we want to be committed is of utmost importance of course, because when we do not know the specifics of wanting to be commitment, at most we may just end up having an interest in whatever we thought at first we should be committed to. Whew. Yes, it sounds so complicated, but it really is not. Allow me to use myself as an example - I have had some fantastic ideas over the years if I do say so myself. If ideas alone could make one rich, I would have been a millionaire at the very least. But I only really pursued the things that I was totally committed to, and those were the things that I have had some success in. Take for instance my writing; I would write morning, noon and night if I have to. So I would like to recommend here that when something has our commitment, which is more than interest, we will be successful. Dont be too angry with yourself if you find that you were not successful at some things then. Try to measure your level of commitment to that particular thing that you thought you wanted to be successful in. Did you go the extra mile Did you lose sleep over that project or plan See it becomes clearer when you ask the questions and take enough time to answer them. Some relevant questions would be Am I committed to my God; my marriage; my relationships with my family and others; my work; making my home a home; changing for better; my health? I think that a lot of us give lip service to the word commitment, and I dont mind being corrected if I am wrong but this is true especially in the areas of romantic relationships. Interesting how I always seem to get there, yes But that is probably because I get so many questions about relationships and probably because I am committed to helping others solve their relationship issues. Ah well. Have you ever felt that being committed takes a lot from you as an individual Well, you are not alone, but there is nothing wrong in wanting to give whatever it is that you want to give your 100 per cent to nothing at all wrong with that. The results are usually well worth all the efforts that we put into getting things done; making things happen; securing the best as much as is humanly possible. So lets get more committed and stay so. Today, I am committed to staying committed in all that I have to do. So lets walk on water for little faith prays, growing faith panics, and seasoned faith walks on water. Much love.

One of the main ways it can do so is through the management of its human resource base. Unfortunately, it seems our priorities lie elsewhere. Instead of ensuring its citizens have the best possible chance of competing on a global scale, our State continues to be more interested in obscure \\u201cinitiatives\\u201d that do not serve the best interests of its people. An individual born in, say, the United States is almost guaranteed a better prospective future than someone born in Trinidad and Tobago, just as someone born in Trinidad and Tobago would have a better prospect than one born in certain parts of the Middle East. It is undeniable that not everyone is born into the same socio-economic context. Race, class, ethnicity, and nationality make the playing field uneven. It is therefore not just a matter of equality, but also of equity. And it is the state which has the duty of reconciling the two. It is morally obligated to ensuring a nation's human resource has equal access to socio-economic development which can level the playing field. Programmes such as a multi-thousand boat cruise that only has the potential to increase tourism and therefore not grounded in any empirical research does not serve the interests of the people. It is a global phenomenon that politicians are generally perceived as self-serving, and our political intelligentsia is no different.

Macintyre made the statement yesterday, as the GHRS appeared before the Joint Select Committee (JSC) (Group Two) of the Parliament. The meeting was held at the J Hamilton Maurice Room. The JSC was chaired by Independent Senator Dr Victor Wheeler. In July 2012, the Express exclusively reported on Rampersad's alleged conflict of interest as chairman of GHRS. Rampersad's private company, Perfect World Human Resources and Management Services, is said to have played a role in short-listing prospective candidates for the chief executive officer's job at National Flour Mills (NFM). Rampersad's private business was incorporated in January 2012, nearly six months after he was made chairman of GHRS. Wheeler asked Macintyre what came out of this situation. Wheeler: In 2012, there were allegations of misconduct involving a senior member of the company's board and this was reported in the press, and the allegations concerned the existence of conflicts of interest regarding transactions that involved the said board member and his private firm. Are you aware if these allegations were substantiated Macintyre: The matter was referred to the Ministry of Finance for them to undertake an audit. We have not received the report on the audit as yet. Wheeler: Are you aware if there were any disciplinary or legal action taken as a result Macintyre: The chairman resigned from the board, the person who the allegations were made against, so there would have been no disciplinary action required.

The latter is actually an international criminal court that supposedly acts to try individuals for breaches of specific crimes such as crimes against humanity and genocide. Why do we link them To emphasise that some countries continue not to be parties to international convention or international law. Neither the United States of America nor Venezuela has ratified UNCLOS. And the ICC No, the United States will not permit its citizens to be tried by the ICC if they commit war crimes. To this one might add the Kyoto Treaty, which has been ignored by the US. We are soon to have 34 countries of the Americas amongst us for three days of talks. Countries seek their national interests first. Do we know ours Have these been debated and agreed upon in Parliament Do we know the interests of the giants such as the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela The United States will be there and whatever citizens might think of President Barack Obama they can be sure of one thing he will be seeking the interests of the United States, as will President Chavez, as will President Morales and the others. President Obama has only been in office three months but we can be sure of some of the interests he will pursue. Among many, the security of US investments in the Americas, security of its overseas markets, security of its borders, national security against terrorist attacks, stability of governments in the hemisphere, preferably in the model of the US democratic system, security of its energy needs, and so on. But there are other interests in others parts of the world. Let's not forget that there are only 35 states in the Americas and many issues and interests arising worldwide will not be discussed, issues such as the intractable Israeli/Palestinian problems, or indeed the Western/Islamic division. One must therefore remember that when President Obama speaks he will always have to consider the reality of his position. It is not that he won his presidency by an overwhelming popular majority. The outcome was 53 per cent to 46 per cent in his favour of a total of about 130 million votes. President Obama, like any other politician, whatever the charm or rhetoric, or ideology, seeks power and a legacy and will do everything to retain power. And in the case of American politics that means the full two terms permitted by their constitution. He has to take into account the other side and the differences in ideologies.

REMARKABLE: Artist Karen De Verteuil stands next to one of her nude pieces, titled \\\"Nude on a Beach\\\", at her recent oils exhibition at 101 Art Gallery. ATTENTION TO DETAIL: \\\"Reclining Nude\\\" by Karen De Verteuil. Artist Karen De Verteuil doesn't take for granted her right to self-expression. The representation of the nude human body in her latest collection is an example of the artist's freedom when it comes to her expressions on canvas. De Verteuil said when it comes to depicting the human figure she is more in sync with what she loves best about her career as an artist. \\\"If a lot of artists are true to themselves, they will paint what they want to paint instead of painting what they think will be saleable. I draw what I want to draw and paint what I want to paint. I try to be honest with myself. Some of my works are nude, but it's what I love to do. I have a passion for drawing the human anatomy,\\\" De Verteuil said. The artist believes that one of the hardest things to draw is the human form. She believes one of the main focuses of the serious artist is the study of the human figure. She said, \\\"It's very interesting; I like to get the body language. It's very important to get the essence of the figure I'm working on. I've always loved to create artwork that depicts people,\\\" she said. The artist recently showed 40 of her latest works at 101 Art Gallery at Holder's Studio in Newtown. While there are various works depicting a number of subjects, De Verteuil's focus has little to do with themes and more to do with structure. Virtually self-taught, De Verteuil mainly works in oils. Though her work is representational, she is mainly concerned with shape, negative space and line. The subject being of less importance than the juxtaposition of planes and colour, she focuses on the near and seeks to explain her delight in the curve of a branch, the crook of an arm or the angle of a neck. She added, \\\"Theme doesn't matter to me. I will do any theme, but it's the details that count. I try not to be too realistic, and I tend to keep things simple and clean,\\\" she said. While De Verteuil is happy with her latest works, she said she is constantly improving her skills and enjoys experimenting. \\\"I keep looking for workshops to improve, but I enjoy experimenting on my own. I like working with pastels so I want to do a lot more of that,\\\"she said.

However, some quick checking yesterday with the Caribbean Community Secretariat in Georgetown and Caricom's Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS),made it abundantly clear that it was neither an error nor a laughing matter. Indeed, with the dust yet to settle on thepoliticalstorm that blew across T&T last Friday in the form of a parliamentary exposure about very extensive and intrusivespying activities operated by theprevious government of ex-prime minister Patrick Manning, there camea surprising press releasethis pastMonday from the Community Secretariat. It announced the holding of a five-day training workshop which is currently occurring in Port of Spain until Friday (November 19) and involves 20 immigration officers from 11 Caricom countries, in addition toseven law enforcement officers from the Special Anti-Crime Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (SAUTT). Under normal circumstances, such a news release from the Community Secretariat would simply have been taken as notification of another work programme of IMPACS. This isthe agency originally established to serve security needs for our region's hosting of Cricket World Cup 2007. However, given the grave implications of the violations of thefundamental rights of citizens across allraces, political parties, social classes and professionsbythe spying network that alsoinvolved activities by SAUTTpersonnel,it is ironic that this state agency is involvedin theso-called \\\"train-the- trainer workshop'' currently underway in Port of Spain. True, arrangements for the workshop would have preceded last week's statement by Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar about the shocking illegal spying operations in which not just SAUTT was initially involved. There came the shocking exposure of even more disturbing dirty activitiesby an uncoveredSecret Intelligence Agency (SIA) that was out of control with millions of dollars and a quantity of sophisticated weapons at its disposal It may perhaps have been too late for either the Caricom Secretariat and/or the T&T government to pull the plug on the five-day \\\"train-the-trainer'' workshop at SAUTT's Cumuto-based training facilities. Nevertheless, it's difficult not to note an insensitivity on the part of those who have collaborated on this training project with SAUTT as core partner, as if oblivious of the negative image of this state agency facing a doubtful future. Unlike what alarming details the people of T&T and the region in general came to learn about last Friday on the SIA, they had already been alerted to the disturbing functioning of SAUTT, for instance, that the six-month old People's Partnership Government of PM Persad-Bissessar felt compelled, on the basis of controversial reports, to terminate the services of the former director of SAUTT and to significantly overhaul its operations, pending furtherdecision on its future. This then, is the same security body that is now involved with IMPACS (the Community's agency dealing with crime and security) for this week's training programme. While SAUTT remains under the microscope with a doubtful future, and the more controversial SIA has been shutdown while the government finalises plans for a structured probe, a formal request is to be made to the Director of Public Prosecution to pursue actions he deems legally relevant. There is, of course, another dimension to the saga of T&T's \\\"spying politics'' that should be considered in the best interest of Caricom as a whole. It is not easy to accept the implications of the gross human rights violations involved in the illegal spying politics in T&T and may have been over looked in relation to their consequences also for member states of Caricom. The reality is that whoever is the prime minister of T&T also holds lead responsibility for crime and security in Caricom's quasi-cabinet. That was the case under Patrick Manning's watch during the past five years when the now recognised spying epidemic was spreading with all the negative effects of illegal interceptions of telephone, email and other forms of communications. In the circumstances, it is felt that PM Persad-Bissessar has a moral obligation to share as much as possible of the illegal spying activitiesby state-funded agencies (SAUTT and SIA) with her community counterparts.

Most of those visitors, if not all, would hardly be put out by such sightings, disturbing though they may be, since homelessness is a feature of the modern world whether it be the result of natural or man-made convulsions or of that individual inability to cope arising from stressful conditions of which drug addiction is as much symptom as cause. By providing facilities for treatment as well as shelter, this Manning administration is attempting to address the call of both humane and unfeeling citizens who feel that \\\"they should put these people somewhere'' meaning, of course, out of sight and, hopefully, out of mind, the problem largely seen to be of the vagrants' own making. Facile as this conclusion is, it is nonetheless true that a major block to their rehabilitation is the addiction that life on the streets turns out to be for many, if not all. In part, this is what is behind Social Development Minister Amery Browne's call on citizens to make the streets unfriendly for homeless people. This is based on the reasoning that as long as the homeless feel they can get by on handouts from the public, they will not be moved to embrace the facilities provided since the curse of addiction is that it makes people behave against their own demonstrable interests. Still it is not certain that citizens will heed his call given both their innate kindness and the onus placed on them by every single religion practised here, to \\\"feed the hungry''. But they should, at least over a period of time, the better for us to chronicle whether the Government's plans for this section of the society will work to the point where not only, or even chiefly, the pavements are free of human detritus but whether these \\\"walking wounded'' regain some level of life quality in keeping with their essential humanity. Their fellows who insist on giving out periodic handouts, the better to meet their religious convictions, thereby salving their own consciences are, in the context of the ongoing and humane drive, being selfish even as they bask in the warmth of their own supposed generosity.

The following is the full text of the statement: \\\"The Caribbean Community is deeply concerned by the ruling of September 23, 2013, of the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic on nationality which modifies retroactively legislation which bestowed citizenship on persons born in the Dominican Republic during the period 1929-2010. \\\"As a result of the ruling, which considers migrants entering the Dominican Republic since 1929 and their children born in the country as 'in transit' and requires them to obtain nationality, a large number of persons who are part of the very fabric of Dominican society would be stripped of Dominican citizenship. \\\"It is estimated that some 210,000 Dominican-born people of Haitian descent who were legally considered Dominican and contributed, as citizens of the Dominican Republic, to the growth and development of their society, economy and politics, would be affected, rendering them stateless in violation of international human rights obligations. The Caribbean Community notes with regret that the decision goes against pronouncements of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (ICHR) which has repeatedly called on the Dominican Republic to adopt measures to guarantee the right to nationality in the country and to adapt its immigration laws and practices in accordance with the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. \\\"The Caribbean Community is particularly concerned about the humanitarian implications of the judgment. The implications of tens of thousands of persons being plunged into a constitutional, legal and administrative vacuum by the ruling are a source of deep distress to those affected and one of significant disquiet for our Community. \\\"The Caribbean Community urges the adoption of measures to protect the human rights and interests of those made vulnerable by this ruling and its grievous effects.\\\" \\u2014CMC TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

One of the approaches I was pursuing up to my ministerial demise was introduction of the village concept in offender management at the Golden Grove Prison as a pilot project of the Ministry of Justice, in which there would be a gradual step away from force and lockdown within the prisons walls. Instead of locking up ten men in a concrete room with a small window like animals, it would be more productive to have them free to roam a large, confined open area in which there would be access to sporting facilities, a supercentre and industry for work. Toilets and washrooms would be available in this village. Each inmate, and in particular low-risk remandees who have not been convicted and are unable to obtain bail, would be issued a smart card which could be renewed each week with approved limits. Each inmate would be able to use the smart card to buy their own cigarettes and other allowable items on the black market listing for a fraction of the cost. There could even be fast-food outlets and, for those who no longer have relatives who care about them, prison industries such as assembling furniture and bikes imported knock-down would offer opportunities for earning income in order to recharge their smart cards. The use of telephones on the wall would allow for monitoring conversations and the obtaining of vital intelligence for interdiction of wrongdoing. In this way, we would treat with our inmates on a more humane basis. Let them sweat out their frustration playing ball rather than have them locked up like dogs in a cell.

Whatever may be said about Saudi Arabia at least their government does take steps to facilitate Muslims who wish to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, an important pillar of the Islamic religion. Few countries can or have interest in maintaining consular offices in all 200-odd countries of the world. In fact there are only 48 diplomatic missions based in Trinidad and Tobago, almost half of them being serviced by honorary consuls. But Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have full embassies in their countries. Normally applications for visas to travel to Saudi Arabia have to be processed in Caracas. The presence of a Saudi diplomat in Trinidad and Tobago to facilitate the granting of visas surely eases the burden on T&T pilgrims. Can we really say that our Government acts likewise We ask this in the light of the experience of some members of the family of Mark Meredith, a former writer for the Express, whose wife and daughter, now resident in New Zealand, find that they cannot acquire machine readable passports except that they travel to London. It seems that until they complete another two years residence and become eligible for New Zealand passports, they are trapped there. This situation is not unlike that faced by many citizens here. We do not of course accuse the Minister of National Security of deliberately deceiving citizens but his recent statements regarding the duration of the wait for new passports do confuse, if not mislead people. While we must accept that there may be a marked shortening of the duration of time for preparation of the document this can only be that interval between the formal interview by appointment and the issue of the document. But can Minister Joseph explain why some citizens continue to be given appointments well into 2011 as has been reported to us Yes, it is true that if an urgent need to travel arises, arrangements can be made to accelerate the process at the passport office. But this begs the question. A related problem is the reduction of the validity of the passport to five years as opposed to ten and the need to repeat the process of appointment and interview. Minister, no system devised by man can ever be error-free. At the same time surely the Government could develop a more humane one where it shows itself genuinely concerned about citizens' welfare.

Robinson was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Caricom Regional Seminar on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), at the Hyatt Regency hotel, Port of Spain, on Monday. The Rome Statute of the ICC is a treaty that established the ICC. Following years of negotiations, aimed at establishing a permanent international tribunal to prosecute individuals accused of genocide and other serious international crimes, such as crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, the ICC was set up. \\\"What we are involved in here (ICC) is an important development in human civilisation, and there cannot be human civilisation without law,\\\" Robinson said. The former prime minister said individuals must be brought to account and there must be no impunity. \\\"Uniformity in treatment of prisoners. Whether the prisoners are prime ministers, presidents or even major generals, the status of persons does not matter,\\\" Robinson said. Robinson said a code of offences has already been developed, and persons can be treated as the law requires without regard to their status, \\\"but equity before the law becomes a principle\\\". Reminiscing about the events which led to this country becoming part of the ICC, Robinson said: \\\"At a time of momentous changes in the world, with decolonisation taking place and discussions on human values and, also, on human rights, there needed to be some sort of solution whereby countries were seeking to resolve their problems by force.\\\" Robinson said his persistence to have the Caribbean region become part of the ICC received support within the Caribbean and Latin America since at the time, there was growing interest, especially since the United States of America used \\\"strong-armed tactics\\\" as a method of seeking justice. Robinson said the road to establishing the ICC was filled with hurdles, however, at the end of the day, human beings would be able to have a sense of security should someone, however powerful \\\"that person may be, invades your security or destroys your humanity or commits any of these crimes against humanityany of these egregious crimesthe permanent court is there for the purpose of trial, conviction and sentencing\\\".

Arsenal won 5-1. \\u0097Photo: AP I suppose if you're having a relationship with a cougar you have to start from scratch. In my case, they hove upon my horizon as an application of an old word to describe a new phenomenon. I had seen them in books and movies as American wildcats and suddenly they became part of the ultra-new age of dating and mating. A cougar, in the human sense, is an older woman who has sexual relationships with young men, known familiarly as \\\"cubs\\\". A few months ago this was new to me and then suddenly the world seemed to be full of cougars and other variations on the theme of sex. Carnival Lines decided against allowing cougar cruises even though Carnival was brave enough to have \\\"gay\\\" cruises. Norwegian and Royal Caribbean have no such problem. New Zealand Air got into trouble with an ad which supposedly portrays \\\"older single women as man-hungry 'cougars' who troll bars for fresh 'meat'.\\\" The New Zealand Herald said the ad was done in the style of a mock nature documentary and encouraged women over 35 who pursue men at least ten years younger to compete for tickets by sending pictures of themselves out with their friends, or \\\"cougar mates,'' presumably on the hunt. According to a recent poll, the top celebrity cougars are Halle Berry (22 per cent), Mariah Carey (11 per cent), Courteney Cox (20 per cent), Heather Locklear (14 per cent) and topping the list was Demi Moore with 27 per cent. She is 47 and married Ashton Kutcher, 27, last year. Someone asked me what is the term for the male equivalent of \\\"cougar\\\"or old men who go for younger women. Believe it or not, it is \\\"Redenbacher\\\" named after the popcorn magnate with the first name \\\"Orville\\\". The usage is said to have originated with Kristin Schaal of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart and refers to \\\"old men who date young, attractive women\\\". Although it is used in a pejorative sense, there is no evidence that Redenbacher was that kind of personboth of his wives died before he did. One would think that \\\"Hefner\\\" might be a better term (as in Hugh Hefner, the Playboy grandfather) or even Michael Douglas. The term \\\"cradle-robber\\\" or \\\"cradle-snatcher\\\" is still used to denote an older man who is interested in young women. Young women who seduce or attract older men are \\\"jailbait\\\" or \\\"Lolitas\\\"the latter named after the young woman or \\\"nymphet\\\" in the Vladimir Nabokov novel. There is also a \\\"May December romance\\\" where, according to Wikipedia, the age difference is wide enough to risk social disapproval. Then there are \\\"gold-diggers\\\" generally young women who \\\"hook\\\" an old, rich man and take him for all he's worth. There are many jokes about these old men. One of them, a 90-year-old man announced to his doctor that he was marrying a 22-year-old blonde. The doctor was aghast, \\\"At your age that could be fatal!\\\" The old man replied with a shrug, \\\"If she dies she dies.\\\" Another old man was having his annual checkup and the doctor asked him how he was feeling. \\\"I've never been better!'' he boasted. \\\"I've got an 18-year-old bride who's pregnant and having my child! What do you think about that'' The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, \\\"Let me tell you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never missed a season. But one day went out in a hurry and accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun. There he was in the woods and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him! He raised his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle. And do you know what happened'' the doctor queried. Dumbfounded, the old man replied \\\"No.'' The doctor continued, \\\"The bear dropped dead in front of him!'' \\\"That's impossible!'' exclaimed the old man. \\\"Someone else must have shot that bear.'' \\\"That's kind of what I'm getting at,'' replied the doctor. Not all the new terms bear repeating in mixed company and there's one that is extremely common that I try to skirt although I believe it is gaining so much currency that my readers should know what is meant when they hear it. More, the abbreviation is widely used so that nobody has to explain word for word what it means. It is the term \\\"MILF\\\". In essence it is an abbreviation for \\\"Mother (or Mom) I'd Like to Fool-around with\\\" although the letter \\\"F\\\" in this sense stands for more than mere fooling around and denotes an act of sexual congress or cohabitation. Wikipedia defines MILF as \\\"a sexually desirable older woman, though not necessarily one who has children. The term is used frequently as a descriptor of pornography featuring older women.\\\" An older women like Sarah Palin, who is a grandmother (and still desirable to some men) is a GILF. For men, if you're a father, you're a FILF. A \\\"Dad\\\" is a DILF. Nobody applies \\\"GILF\\\" to men or grandfathers. Last year the Oxford English Dictionary recognised \\\"Gaydar\\\" which is \\\"A homosexual person's ability to identify another person as homosexual by interpreting subtle signals conveyed by their appearance, interests etc. They also added \\\"Grrrl'' which means \\\"A young woman regarded as independent and strong or aggressive, especially in her attitude to men or in her sexuality.'' I am not sure where all this is heading as every day the internet and mobile phones are changing the language so quickly that many of us are left behind. The fact is IDRK (text for \\\"I Don't Really Know\\\") what's going on but IMHEIUO (In My Highly Exalted Informed Unassailable Opinion), this is TEOTWAWKI (The End Of The World As We Know It). Tony Deyal was last seen saying that if anyone called him a \\\"FILF\\\" his wife would die \\\"LOLH\\\" (Laughing Out Loud Hysterically).

Once again, I have drawn attention to the danger posed to countries of the Caribbean by the withdrawal of correspondent banking relations (CBRs) from regional banks by global banks in the US. As lead speaker at the opening of a legislative forum in the US House of Representatives on Capitol Hill, as part of Caribbean-American Heritage Month on June 5, I told an audience representing the US congress, the US government, diplomats, and US and Caribbean businessmen, the following: \\u201cCBRs are the lifeblood of global commerce and human development. They are as vital to the world as are air and sea transportation, telecommunications, the Internet, and the fight to end communicable diseases\\u201d. Without CBRs nations will not be able to pay each other for purchases of basic things, such as food and medicine, and ordinary things like buses, trucks and motor cars. Without CBRs the global financial and trading system would come to a halt, and affected countries will collapse into poverty from which recovery will be costly, both in time and money, but more importantly in human life. This grave threat has been hanging over the Caribbean now for almost half a decade, and it shows no sign of abating, despite statements to the contrary. Right now, in many parts of the Caribbean, most banks are reduced to having only one correspondent bank, and at an extremely high cost. Not only have the fees for these CBRs reached prohibitively high levels, they are taking longer periods of time to deliver services because of heightened scrutiny. Where, in the past, a cross-border transaction could take two days, it can now take as long as two weeks from our smaller, indigenous financial institutions. The cost of doing business in our region is escalating, even as we try to cope with high debt, incurred largely to recover our countries from disasters that have increased in frequency and intensity as a result of global warming and sea level rise that point like daggers at the heart of the existence of many of our island states. It is claimed \\u2014 wrongfully \\u2014 that Caribbean countries have weak anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing regimes, and this is the reason global banks in the US are withdrawing CBRs. But, the two bodies with the authority to determine the quality and standing of the regimes in the Caribbean, have judged most Caribbean countries to be in compliance with their rigorous standards. Those bodies are the Financial Action Task Force and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development Global Forum. In some sectors of financial services Caribbean legislative and enforcement machineries have been rated at a higher level of compliance than the US. Nonetheless, the Caribbean faces the real danger of being \\u201cde-banked\\u201d, and cut off from the world\\u2019s trading and financing system, including not being able to pay for its imports from the United States\\u2014the country that the region chooses as its major source market. I went on to point out that \\u201cif Caribbean economies diminish, the consequences will be increased unemployment, enlarged poverty, increased crime, and the advent of economic refugees that will swell the numbers of those gathering on the US southern border\\u201d. Earlier in the presentation, I had stressed that while the US suffers a trade deficit with many countries and regions of the world, it enjoys a perennial trade surplus with the 14 independent Caricom countries collectively, which increases every year. In 2015, the value of the US balance of trade surplus was US$4.1 billion; in 2016, it rose to US$4.6 billion, jumping to US$5.5 billion in 2017, and escalating further to US$7 billion in 2018. That money has provided profits for American companies and jobs for American people. I also drew attention to the reality that, since the 1990s, US official development assistance to the region has steadily declined. In 2017, a year in which the US enjoyed a $5.5-billion trade surplus with Caricom countries, the region, including Haiti, received a mere 0.9 per cent of US global allocation of official development assistance. These figures were not mentioned in complaint. Every country in the world has the right to decide to whom it provides assistance, to what extent it does so, and for what purposes. But, since the Caricom region provides the US with an escalating trade surplus every year, the US should have an interest in the economic growth and prosperity of these nations. In the final analysis, if Caribbean countries are unable to maintain a stable rate of economic growth, or if they decline, they will no longer be able to purchase goods and services from the US, and the trade surplus which the US has continuously enjoyed will shrink, and so too will the revenues and jobs that it generates in America. Therefore, there is a symbiotic and mutual interest in the US-Caribbean relationship that must be recalibrated to ensure that, as the \\u201cthird border\\u201d of the US, the Caribbean remains a zone of peace and a stable economic and political space. That means that the US and Caribbean countries should set \\u2014 and measure their relations \\u2014 in the mutuality of their interests. All issues should be discussed, including the hot button ones for the US, such as Venezuela, Nicaragua, and even the role of China in the region, but they ought not to be the single prism through which relations are evaluated. Today, most Caricom countries are stable and democratic and human rights are respected and upheld, the rights of the individual and of businesses thrive, and the rule of law is maintained. But these conditions are only maintainable in conditions of sustained development. Democracy, freedom and the rule of law are fragile plants whose growth and strength must be watered and fed by the nutrients of economic development. The US cannot choose to move out of the neighbourhood any more than can Caribbean countries opt to relocate elsewhere. They each, therefore, have an obligation to recognise their mutuality of interests and to act on it. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

As we look on helplessly, we are reminded of just how dangerous the world is and why we need to cherish and protect every freedom that we have. Like others before them, the people of Syria have discovered that the world does not come running to help, unless it perceives a threat to its own interest. This is the dilemma that faces international diplomacy when a government turns the forces of State might against its own citizens: political self-interest versus humanitarian interest. In 1983 Trinidad and Tobago faced this question when the Maurice Bishop-led People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada imploded. How do we assist And on what terms The issue was settled with the military intervention of the United States which triggered a major controversy over national sovereignty, Caricom as a regional force, and the humanitarian responsibilities of neighbours. Today, the dilemma facing international diplomacy involves Syria where the confrontation between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government forces has escalated to the level of civil war with fatal and catastrophic consequences for the country and its people. According to the Red Cross, over 17,000 people have been killed since March last year. Collateral damage in terms of property, human hardship and industrial and economic collapse is incalculable As in the case of the other uprisings of the Arab Spring, the Syria crisis was sparked by a people's hope for change, only to be met with the full fire-power of an authoritarian regime that refuses to be challenged. While the world watched, the al-Assad regime dug in its heels and issued the order for a full military response, intent on avoiding the fate of Mubarak in Egypt and Gadaffi in Libya. Yesterday, in the country's largest city, Aleppo, military planes were said to be strafing civilians on the streets as hundreds of thousands packed their bundles and fled the city with their lives. What irony that such open bloodshed could be taking place on the same planet where just across the English Channel, the zenith of human excellence is being celebrated. How ironic, too, that the very superpowers that agree to ascribe to the highest values of the Olympic Games cannot rise above narrow self-interest to find common ground for a solution to the Syrian crisis. As in Libya, the war between the government and people of Syria is now a fight to the finish. Both sides are committed to battling to the end. Especially for the civilian forces, there can be no turning back. As a country that has provided succour for generations of Syrians who have found a home here, we can add our voices in support of an inventive international response to bringing peace to Syria.

To be with, talk with people working to strengthen their environments seeking to make them safer more nurturing and supportive spaces. \\\"The pervading mood in the country needs to be changed. It is when times are most difficult that we need to dig deep and to be creative and innovative in our problem solving. Our voices must speak to affirmation, hope and healing, and a willingness to take action. People need to be infused with positive energy, words of encouragement, to be inspired and motivated. Time must be set aside to give thanks for the often taken for granted strengths that we have and utilise them as tools of liberation. We must give thanks for those who shared our lives and who are no longer with us; and to honour their memory by working towards the creation of a better society. \\\"As a first step people must be mobilised to come together in their own interest and to organise towards the reclamation of our families, homes, neighbourhoods, villages, and our country. A true and sustainable sense of security and well being, the protection of our children will come, and must come from a place of consciousness, solidarity and a deep desire to defend our freedoms. The people will gather from noon on the Brian Lara Promenade, Port of Spain, to give thanks and celebrate, among other things: lLife love and our country Trinidad and Tobago lMotherhood the birthing of children and gifting of citizens to this nation lMothering the important work women do taking care of our children lTheir resilience and perseverance in the face of many difficulties. The gathering will provide a space and opportunity to redirect our energy l To spread an ethic of forgiveness of self and others and a commitment to do better lTo promote unity of purpose in strengthening family in all its forms lTo work towards better relationships and the letting go of pain and hurt lTo influence people to leave the encounter committed to taking the message of, hope and healing to their communities and recruit others to take action.

My interest was renewed after I looked at a series called Fauda. The acting is not the best but it made me realise that after so long, the lines of demarcation in the conflict are not that clear. While many of their exchanges were internecine, human relationships which were almost familial were developing alongside. Nakba, or catastrophe, is the word used by Palestinians to describe that day in 1948 when 750,000 of their forefathers were required to move out of the homes in which they had lived and the lands which they owned to be relocated to other areas. In a bitter irony, it was a forced exodus from an area seen by many religions as the Holy land. Their homes and lands were given to Jewish people, many of whom had survived the unspeakable horrors of German Nazi camps. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling.

The general contention is that there is a low level of awareness and understanding of this universal set of norms and standards to which Trinidad and Tobago has signed on and has become a contracting party. We often ignore the fact that the basic human rights provisions have not found their way into our Constitution \\\"out of the blue\\\", but are inspired by and derived from the universal system of human rights. While we are all subjected to ever-increasing globalisation and complain about the negative effects in particular on the more vulnerable countries, we ignore the existence of the ever-evolving international system of human rights, set up to protect the rights of the weaker and vulnerable people of our societies. Why then the low awareness and little recognition Could it be simple ignorance, neglect, misunderstanding, information deficit It's probably all of the above. The widespread call for the resumption of hanging in light of heinous crimes and gruesome murders is well understood. What is not understood is the call by some to withdraw T&T from international human rights bodies and treaties, in order to resume hanging. Nowhere in the international human rights system, at least in those instruments that Trinidad and Tobago has ratified, is there a provision that simply outlaws capital punishment altogether. Reference is made to one of the two basic pillars of the international human rights system which was ratified by T&T in 1978, i.e. the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It speaks specifically to the question of capital punishment. While it stipulates in Article Six, the inherent right to life for every human being, it allows for exceptions, notably for states which have not abolished the death penalty. They \\\"may impose it only for the most serious crimes, in accordance with the law in force and in accordance with a final judgment rendered by a competent court\\\". Thus, there is no need to withdraw from the Covenant and deprive citizens of the protection of other basic civil and political rights. What has been added in our own jurisdiction is the condition that capital punishment must be carried out within a certain timeframe, a namely maximum five years from the date of the first sentence to the date of the final judgment. The Covenant give states the opportunity to sign on to two optional protocols. One gives people the right to directly appeal to the UN Human Rights Committee. The other entails a commitment of signatory states to abolish the death penalty altogether. Trinidad and Tobago withdrew from the first optional protocol under the previous UNC administration, and with regard to the second optional protocol, it has never signed on to it, precisely because this protocol is \\\"optional\\\" and entails the commitment to abolish the death penalty. The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, like all the other basic human rights instruments, imposes on states the obligation to submit periodic reports to the respective UN Human Rights bodies/committees, composed of independent human rights experts. Such reports should be presented every three to five years and they should indicate progress made and challenges encountered by the states in implementing at the national level the various human rights treaties. These reports are examined by the experts in concert with the national representatives, not to sanction possible shortcomings, but to provide advice and assistance. In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, it must be noted that this country is lagging far behind in fulfilling its reporting obligations. The last time T&T presented a report to the UN Human Rights Committee was 1999. Why then the question is asked again is there little recognition and awareness of the international human rights system in T&T It is admitted that, overall, the country's human rights record is relatively good. No gross human rights violations have taken place since independence. This may explain in part the absence of any high interest in international human rights issues, except now in the debate on capital punishment and its implications. However, there is need for promotion and wider appreciation of the international human rights system. Promoting international human rights is often a question of educational priorities. Nowhere in our high school system is there place and space for human rights teaching. Worse yet, nowhere in our law school and on the campus of UWI is there any structured teaching or research conducted on the international system of human rights and its application in T&T; so that generations of lawyers do not have the necessary knowledge and understanding of this particular branch of international law. This is also a call to the media to heighten their interest and coverage of noteworthy information relating to the international human rights system. To conclude by giving just one example: The UN Human Rights Council has set up a human rights probe into the deadly raid by Israel on a Gaza-bound Turkish flotilla carrying food and other relief articles. The probe is conducted by a panel of three human rights experts, headed by Karl Hudson-Phillips. The international media carried this news item, but no mention was made in the local media. Karl and his team are right now in the Middle East for further investigations. This international human rights assignment would also explain his absence at the national awards ceremony at Queen's Hall on Independence Day! Dr Hans Geiser is former head of UN/UNDP. He is Hon.

The Huffington Post recently reported (February 7) that six US states are considering putting an end to laws restricting dog ownership by breed; joining 17 states which already have laws that prevent breed-based discrimination against dogs. Many jurisdictions are coming to the conclusion that not only are such laws expensive to enforce, they do not improve public safety. As stated by one attorney quoted in the HuffPost, the scientific studies show it doesnt work. The data does show, however, that dog bites and dog bite-related fatalities are a serious problem in the United States, where the situation has been extensively researched. One of the most recent studies, published in 2013 by a multi-author group, identified 256 dog bite-related fatalities (DBRFs) in the US between 2000 and 2009. Another study identified 238 such cases between 1979 and 1998. The 2013 study identified several factors involved in DBRFs and found that factors tended to co-occur. The factors identified were: a) absence of an able-bodied person to intervene87.1 per cent; b) incidental or no familiar relationship of victims with dogs85.2 per cent; c) owners failure to neuter dogs 84.4 per cent; d) compromised ability of victims to interact appropriately with dogs 77.4 per cent; e) dogs kept isolated from positive human interaction (versus family dogs) 76.2 per cent; f) owners prior mismanagement of dogs 37.5 per cent; and g) owners history of neglect or abuse of dogs 21.1 per cent Four or more of these factors co-occurred in 80.5 per cent of the deaths. Data from the 1979-1998 study showed that young children were the most frequent victims, followed by the elderly. Most attacks are carried out by in-tact male dogs, and more than half of the attacks were perpetrated by unrestrained dogs in a home, while 17 per cent were by restrained dogs in a home and 24 per cent were by unrestrained dogs away from a home. The statistics suggest that the number of attacks can be reduced, some attacks can be prevented, and that action by owners is important in the prevention and reduction of these attacks. These actions include: choice of an appropriate dog for the family, neutering of dogs, prevention or close supervision of interactions of children with dogs, proper socialisation of puppies and dogs, proper humane confinement of dogs, appropriate care and regular interaction with the dog by family members. Understanding how dogs communicate especially in stressful situations is also important. Brenda Aloff, who specialises in managing aggression in dogs through behaviour modification, states that dogs rarely bite without warning. Most bites happen because humans have missed or misinterpreted the warning signs. It is the owners responsibility to recognise the signs of stress and to ensure that the dog is not placed in a position where it is stressed to the point where it feels it must defend itself. In one study, analysis of the situations in which bites occurred revealed that, in one-third of cases, bites were triggered by teasing of the dog. Given a choice, most dogs will choose flight over fight. However, dogs perceiving a threat without a means of escape, because of being cornered or chained for example, will feel forced to defend themselves, and may attack in such circumstances. Note that aggression can also be caused by medical problems, so dogs should be regularly examined by a qualified veterinarian. The role of the authorities includes protecting the public and the dogs by ensuring responsible behaviour by owners and protection of the animals from cruelty and abuse. In Jamaica, abuse of animals seems to be taken for granted. I recently contacted the Office of the Police Commissioner about a report of animal abuse but never received an acknowledgement. Some persons will no doubt argue that the police are busy dealing with far more serious issues. However, studies show that abuse of animals can be a precursor to antisocial behaviour. So, if for no other reason, enlightened self-interest would suggest that cases of animal abuse and cruelty be investigated and perpetrators given psychological help or appropriate sanctions as required. The matter of dog-human aggression comes to attention in Jamaica because of attacks which sometimes result in death. Statistics from other countries indicate that, for each fatality or serious attack, thousands of bites have occurred. Since security concerns as well as other social factors in Jamaica will continue to encourage ownership of dogs, including large, powerful breeds, a strategy for safe management of dog-human interactions is required, including detailed data collection and analysis of biting incidents, public education and appropriate legislation.

Many times, he displayed attributes that have surely earned the confidence and respect amongst these workers as one of their key men to engage in long-enthralling negotiations with management, most times, resulting in favourable and amicable settlements. Perhaps his quest for progress and disciplinary niche for expertly balancing the moments when to be tough and then gentle in his deliberations for rightful humane causes is what endears him to all proactive-thinking people. Based on this passion for unity and a better quality of life for everyone in cohesive nation-building, McLeod's recent decision to distance himself from certain stands adopted by the Movement for Social Justice (MSJ) is highly expected. As a founding member in the present People's Partnership Government, and even more as the Minister of Labour and Micro Enterprises, McLeod is well aware where his principles and integrity lie when it comes to loyalty in teamwork in the Partnership. During his \\\"trade union days\\\", he probably must have envisioned that one day, he could be part of the decision-making processes to help workers, somewhat of \\\"a modern-day biblical Joseph\\\" experience. He looks at the bigger picture, not only for working class causes but for the wider national interests.

But when she hit American soil, she unleashed her new found social conscience through the use of social media; especially since she lives near Toledo, Ohio. The city has the most dubious distinction of being dubbed \\\"the third largest gateway for child sex tourism and child sex trafficking in America.\\\" It is one of the big hubs for exploitation and trafficking. There's a huge truck stop and they move the children from trailer to trailer, at night. I had to join the fight to stop trafficking and make America know this is happening in our own backyard.\\\" Sex trafficking is now big business in small town America. Toledo has made headlines, over the last few months, as the supplier to a booming child sex tourism industry in Las Vegas. According to a recent research study conducted by the University of Toledo and chaired by Professor Celia Williamson, \\\"The City of Toledo has run aground of some hard economic times. The underground economy has grown a bit larger in response. This includes anything from hair braiding without a cosmetology license to neighborhood auto mechanics working on a cash-only basis, to selling children as young as 6 months old into sex slavery.\\\" Ohio's Attorney General, Richard Condray, founded a group that searches the city for victims. He was quoted in a local newspaper: \\\"Toledo exhibits the highest per capita related victim rate in the USA. At least 1,800 people at any point in time in Ohio are held in trafficking bondage. It is incredible. Also incredible is that 6-month-old infants are used sexually and that men pay $1,000 for 20 minutes to use girls ages 6 months to 12 years in sex tourism.\\\" Disturbed by such revelations, together with a friend from her congregation, Bradford created a small church ministry to generate awareness among the flock and raise funds to help with the reintegration and resocialisation of girls and women who made it out alive and back safely to their country of origin. \\\"We import merchandise from an international company. The items are all handmade by former sex slaves and we resell them; sending the profit back to India to help a group of women.\\\" When the venture took off, Bradford decided to extend her reach and expand the scope of her public awareness campaign with a website www.fairexpressions.com. \\\"All the bags are handmade in Calcutta by victims of human trafficking. The jewelry is made in Africa and Thailand. By sending our profits back to these women we are showing that we are committed to fair trade and we want to ensure that these women have the money and the resources to stay out of the sex trade. \\\"The problem is really much bigger than we think,\\\" she added. She was further shocked when she saw the documentary Playground; executive produced by George Clooney, Grant Heslov, and Steven Soderbergh, with animation by Japanese pop artist Yoshitomo Nara. \\\"Playground illuminates a sinister industry of unrecognised pervasiveness,\\\" as stated on the website of the Nest Foundation; \\\"an unknown epidemic, essential viewing for any parent or engaged citizen.\\\" It is as engaging as it is horrifying and raises some equally painful questions. \\\"Sumatra, Indonesia, Tsunami, 35,000 children orphaned. Only 1,036 accounted for\\\" Law enforcement experts say most of these children have been trafficked for sex and the rest probably sold through adoption by the same trafficking syndicates. Some were sold into the sex trade or into brothels by family, best friends and classmates. \\\"I like the young ones because they are tight and scream loud,\\\" said a \\\"customer\\\" with a smile; bold, or maybe sick, enough to show his toothless face on camera. \\\"The stories are very sad,\\\" said Bradford. But beyond sad they are scary. \\\"If men are turning up in Cambodia to abuse children, they have already been abusing children in their own country,\\\" explained an FBI agent featured in Playground.

As we look on helplessly, we are reminded of just how dangerous the world is and why we need to cherish and protect every freedom that we have. Like others before them, the people of Syria have discovered that the world does not come running to help, unless it perceives a threat to its own interest. This is the dilemma that faces international diplomacy when a government turns the forces of State might against its own citizens: political self-interest versus humanitarian interest. In 1983 Trinidad and Tobago faced this question when the Maurice Bishop-led People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada imploded. How do we assist And on what terms The issue was settled with the military intervention of the United States which triggered a major controversy over national sovereignty, Caricom as a regional force, and the humanitarian responsibilities of neighbours. Today, the dilemma facing international diplomacy involves Syria where the confrontation between the government of Bashar al-Assad and anti-government forces has escalated to the level of civil war with fatal and catastrophic consequences for the country and its people. According to the Red Cross, over 17,000 people have been killed since March last year. Collateral damage in terms of property, human hardship and industrial and economic collapse is incalculable As in the case of the other uprisings of the Arab Spring, the Syria crisis was sparked by a people's hope for change, only to be met with the full fire-power of an authoritarian regime that refuses to be challenged. While the world watched, the al-Assad regime dug in its heels and issued the order for a full military response, intent on avoiding the fate of Mubarak in Egypt and Gadaffi in Libya. Yesterday, in the country's largest city, Aleppo, military planes were said to be strafing civilians on the streets as hundreds of thousands packed their bundles and fled the city with their lives. What irony that such open bloodshed could be taking place on the same planet where just across the English Channel, the zenith of human excellence is being celebrated. How ironic, too, that the very superpowers that agree to ascribe to the highest values of the Olympic Games cannot rise above narrow self-interest to find common ground for a solution to the Syrian crisis. As in Libya, the war between the government and people of Syria is now a fight to the finish. Both sides are committed to battling to the end.

Pink is an American leadership and motivational speaker and best-selling author who explores the topics of human behaviour, and ideas on motivation and drive, and the concept that the secret to high performance and satisfaction at work, school and home is the \\\"deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn, create and do better by ourselves and our world\\\". He has been interviewed by TV personality Oprah Winfrey, and was the chief speech writer for former US vice-president Al Gore. \\\"I consider myself a student of human behaviour. What I've found are two things: how consistently irrational people are and how good people are. We don't make very good choices, like save for retirement or exercise and eat well, but we have understand how much people will do things because it is the right thing to do,\\\" Pink told the audience via video chat at a special breakfast meeting yesterday at the GSB's Mt Hope Campus. GSB executive director Prof Miguel Carillo said Pink's ideas bring a view of human behaviour complementary to former presenters Malcolm Gladwell in 2012, who talked about \\\"outliers\\\" and the concept of positive deviance; and last year's Marcus Buckingham, who spoke about how people can develop their skills and strengths over time. The DLIC will be held on April 10 at the Hyatt Regency (Trinidad), Port of Spain. Registration is US$1,000. \\\"We have 350 people already registered and paid; we are expecting 500.

Such a political connection had surfaced during Haiti's last presidential election campaign that was won by the 50-year old former popular music pop star. And late last month, he was to raise new concerns following a report by the news agency Associated Press (AP) that he was favouring a presidential pardon in the interest of national \\\"poitical reconciliation\\\" instead of a court trial for crimes against humanity. However, when he was interviewed in a radio programme earlier this month during an official visit to Ireland, President Martelly backed away from the idea of a \\\"presidential pardon\\\", claiming that his comment was \\\"misunderstood\\\" by the AP report.. But other media reports did not buy into his expressed sentiment in favour of \\\"reconciliation\\\" instead of a long court trial for Duvalier's claimed crimes against humanity during his 15 years rule that ended with a popular urprising and forced him into exile. The Los Angeles Times, for one, was to editorialise on February 6 why Duvalier should be prosecuted for atrocities committed during his dictatorial rule. In its argument the Times reflected the thinking of human rights organisations in the world, including those in Haiti, that the ex-dictator should face justice for his crimes against humanity. Rejecting the Haitian judge's position that the statute of limitations for a court trial on human rights abuses had expired, the Times argued that \\\"there are plenty of victims willing to recount the beatings, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detentions they suffered Further, that there is a trove of evidence detailing how Duvalier's \\\"army and shadowy secret police force, the Tontons Macoutes, killed and tortured untold number of civiliansAnd the fact that there are international conventions, to which Haiti is a signatory, that require it to investigate and prosecute crimes committed by Duvalier and his government\\\" Conscious that such an argument would resonate with human rights agencies and organisations regionally and internationally, the Times pointed out that Human Rights Watch, the United Nations as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, are on record as having urged Haiti's courts to respect its international obligations that \\\"when it comes to crimes against humanity, there can be no statute of limitations\\\". The Caricom Secretariat has an obligation to carefully monitor this development given its implications for the rest of our Caribbean Community, and its support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) which continues to deal with crimes against humanity by political tyrants. Ever since President Martelly had signalled his intention to re-establish a Haitian army and former political thugs in uniforms have been viewed among others training for potential recruitmen for the proposed \\\"new army\\\", there has been growing uneasiness of a likely return to a grim political culture with which the army had been associated.
