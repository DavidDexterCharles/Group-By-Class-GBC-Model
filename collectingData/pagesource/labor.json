Rajkumar, 56, was shot in the head and chest, and died at hospital. His wife, Camille Rajkumar, was standing at his side when the killer opened fire and she screamed for help. The killer rode off on a bicycle. Around 9.30 p.m. a man entered Rajkumar's businessplace named Unity Bar. He asked for half of a bottle of puncheon rum, and Rajkumar told him the cost was $105. The man then pulled out a firearm and at close range, fired three times at Rajkumar. As Rajkumar collapsed, the man jumped on his bicycle and rode off. A video circulating on social media showed moments after the shooting, Rajkumar's wife screaming and begging him to wake up. Rajkumar was taken to the San Fernando General Hospital, but he was pronounced dead upon arrival.

Lindsay Thompson, 75 and his wife Ruth, holding a photograph showing them on their wedding day almost half a century ago. Lindsay Thompson shows part of his colelciton of Amerindian artefatcs found on the Quinam Beach over the past two decades The eroding Quinam Beach on Trinidad's south coast The Amerindian artefacts discovered by Lindsay Thompson on the Quinam Beach, where there was once an Amerindian settlement. The caveman stood in front his cave, And watched the surging of the angry waves, Higher and higher up it goes, Spiralling from the wind that blows, As it lashed ashore in the mingling sand, Grasping everything it reached as a mighty hand. WHEN Lindsay Thompson was 14-years-old, he was witness to a child's drowning in the muddy waters off the Quinam Beach on Trinidad's south coast. That was in the 1950s, and Thompson was already done with school and working the cocoa fields of the famed Coora Estate south of Siparia. But as Thompson tells it, he decided that labouring shouldn't interfere with learning. A school need not be a building, and no teacher needed to tell him the importance of an education in pre-Independence Trinidad. A man has plenty time to consider the purpose of everything in those long hours on the plantation, he said. So he became a poet, philosopher, and thinker, at a time of the Black Power Movement, of which he identified, writing his own theory, in a scientific paper, about the role of the earth, moon and sun and its connection to life on the planet. One of his many poems \\u201cThe Caveman\\u201d marked that memory of the drowning he could do nothing to prevent. He couldn't believe but what he saw, Was his infant son playing upon the shore, With an angry scowl upon his face, He dashed forward in a deathly race But the waves were faster than his feet. As it took the infant child beneath The course of his life would change he said, when at age 21, he met Ruth. So he wrote a poem which sealed the deal that led to marriage, seven children, and reality. Lindsay Thompson, 75 and his wife Ruth, holding a photograph showing them on their wedding day almost half a century ago. Thompson took a job with the Water and Sewerage Authority but continued to work the land not far from the beach. And to this beach he would return, 21-years-ago, to save himself. His son had been crushed by equipment in an oilfield accident. He was still alive when extricated and transferred to the San Fernando General Hospital. At the time, there was a work to rule protest by doctors agitating for better terms and conditions. Thompson said a senior doctor decided his son was not an \\u201cemergency\\u201d case. And his son died. \\u201cThe truth is I wanted to wipe out a lot of people. Doctors, lawyers, a lot of people, for what happened to my son. So I went to the beach to find myself, to deal with those feelings\\u201d, said Thompson, whose poem written when 17-years-old, would come to speak of his rage. His massive hand beat upon his breast, As an angry roar bursts from his chest, And he shouted to the restless sea. I 'll lick you yet, someday you'll see. And then took the child upon the ground, And slowly headed homeward bound, He placed him gently in his grave, Deep within that hideous cave. And that is how Thompson came to be one of most unlikely people to own a priceless collection of pre-Colonial artefacts. Thompson, 75, said that while climbing the rocks at the base of the cliffs at Quinam: \\u201cAll of a sudden I was seeing these things glittering. It was coins, and pieces of gold. That first day, I found 15 pieces\\u201d. The eroding Quinam Beach on Trinidad's south coast Rings earrings, and bracelets - lost by bathers or tossed into the sea by believers, the jewellery tumbling back to shore through the actions of the waves and currents, including the golden false teeth of some unfortunate visitor. He started visiting the beach frequently, and while walking the shoreline, began finding the curiously shaped rocks. \\u201cI knew immediately what it was. Amerindian stone tools\\u201d said Thompson, who had found similar artefacts while working his land. \\u201cI think about the people who did that, how they lived, and the time it took to make those sharp edges\\u201d, said Thompson, who also found human remains from what was a First People settlement revealed by the rapid erosion along the coast. The artefacts should one day be studied as part of the research into how the island's original occupants lived, he said. But while he is open to offers, Thompson is no slave to material things. When the Express met up with him at his home on a side road located off a side road, it was dusk and he was preparing to drive into town (Siparia) with his wife in the family's Datsun. He showed some of his treasures, delivered his 60-year-old poems from memory, and shared some of his beliefs. Thompson, who called himself \\u201cThe last caveman\\u201d, said: \\u201cLove. The universal language. The only language that God created was love. All the rest is dialect. If you speak in the language of her, everybody understands. People are far away from that these days. People are for material things\\u201d. And he left us with this: In the footsteps of love, walks lust A constant shadow hoping to conquer her He looms big in the morning sunrise Posing a constant threat Then getting smaller and smaller at noontime To be trampled upon Then getting bigger and bigger again at evening time Posing another threat But then love sleeps to awake refreshed, to do battle again Love is always victorious NOTE: This article was first published in November 2015. Thompson died on April 20 the following year. According to his daughter: \\\"Though humble, my father was a proud man, and he was only too happy to share some of himself with all who were willing to listen. Thank you so much for that story, for engaging with him. It is part of his legacy that will live on\\\". WHAT THOMPSON FOUND Dr. Basil Reid, Senior Lecturer in Archaeology Department of History, and The University of the West Indies, and Professor Brent Wilson, Palaeontologist at UWI, were asked about the artefacts found by Thopmson. Dr Reid said based on the photograph he examined, the stones found by Thompson appear to be petaloid celts. They were probably hafted into wooden handles and used as axes by the early natives of Quinam. Dr Reid said the Quinam site is listed in the inventory of the Archaeology Unit (Department of History) as a (Palo Seco) Saladoid site on the south coast of Trinidad. The stone tools found by Lindsay Thompson on the Quinam Beach on Trinidad's south coast Palo Seco is a Trinidadian \\\"local\\\" group of the Saladoid culture that extended from Trinidad and Tobago to Puerto Rico during the period 500 BC to AD 600. Palo Seco pottery has several traits (especially after A.D. 350) resulting from trade/interaction between the Saladoid of Trinidad and the Barrancoid of South America, said Dr Reid. He said petaloid celts were among the items that comprised the diverse toolkit of these early Trinidadian natives. He said: \\u201cThe celts - at least the larger ones - were in probability used for felling trees and building boats while the smaller ones had a more ceremonial function. And to answer Thompson's query about how the stones were honed, it was one hard rock rubbed against a harder rock, said historian David Maharaj. Lindsay Thompson shows part of his colelciton of Amerindian artefatcs found on the Quinam Beach over the past two decades And if any of the stones came from outside of Trinidad, it would suggest trade/interactions between the pre-colonial natives of Quinam and their counterparts in either Tobago or north-eastern South America, since such interactions - facilitated by watercraft technology- were quite common during Caribbean prehistory.

Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. PriceSmart, La Romaine A man came to court yesterday and blamed his wife for them being arrested and charged with stealing a security camera system and clothing from PriceSmart last week. Both were sentenced to nine months in prison. Neil Deonarine said his wife, Mala Rampersad-Deonarine, told him the camera system would look good at their home and while he advised her that they could not afford it, she told him to put it in her handbag. He complied. The two were sentenced to the jail term by San Fernando Senior Magistrate Cherril-Anne Antoine. Police prosecutor Cleyon Seedan said the theft of the camera system, three ladies\\u2019 vests and one pair of men\\u2019s short pants took place at 4.30 p.m. last Friday at PriceSmart, La Romaine. The two were spotted taking the items by a security guard and stopped as they exited the building without paying the cost, which amounted to $2,794.75. Police Constable De Bourg was contacted and did further investigations. Deonarine, 49, a labourer, confessed. \\u201cMy wife tell me this camera system will look good home and I tell she we can\\u2019t afford it and she tell me put it in she handbag and I did,\\u201d he said. Rampersad-Deonarine, 46, who provides geriatric care, told the police: \\u201cI see the camera system and I like it and I wanted it. We didn\\u2019t have plenty money so I told my husband to put it in my bag.\\u201d The couple, of Carat Hill, Barrackpore, has a 14-year-old child who has lived with his grandparents since shortly after the child\\u2019s birth. Rampersad-Deonarine had a previous conviction 20 years ago for uttering a false declaration and larceny. She said she was fined for those offences and had since changed her life. The two apologised before Antoine for their actions. Deonarine denied that they were going to sell the camera system. Rampersad-Deonarine explained to the court that she took it because her husband would leave home at 2.30 a.m. to head to work and she would be home alone. They both agreed with the magistrate that they could have saved money and purchased the system instead of stealing it. The husband and wife were each sentenced to nine months\\u2019 hard labour.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"Osmond Baboolal and his sister Hematee, on the day their lives were destroyed. Whenever Richard Charan posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. Osmond Baboolal and his sister Hematee, on the day their lives were destroyed. NEAR the junction leading to the mud volcano and narco mansion of Piparo is the turn-off to Pooran Street in the former sugarcane village of Williamsville. Here you will find the ruins of a burnt-out house hidden behind the bushes. The property is fenced, with a no-trespass sign warning \\u201cProperty of the Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Committee\\u201d. Not that anyone would ever want to squat or rebuild on that plot. This was a place of death. The neighbours are silent about what happened here. Go ask somebody else, they tell you. Some things are better left unspoken. Even after all these years. Small-time crook Levi Morris helped the Dole Chadee gang kill four people at that house in 1994. For turning State witness and ratting on his fellow murderers, Morris got his freedom for ensuring that his accomplices got the noose, a crude casket, and an unmarked prison grave. For his help, Morris was rewarded with a new identity in a European capital. When the Express last heard about him, Morris had earned a diploma in business, was holding a good job and visiting Trinidad often to check out friends and family. The case also made millionaires of lawyers, made legends of politicians, fast-tracked promotions for police officers. But for others involved, nothing but eternal misery. Popo's life on the streets Villager Chunilal Popo, too, was a crucial witness for the State. He was a watchman nearby the night Morris and his accomplices came to Pooran Avenue on Chadee's orders to \\u201ckill everybody\\u201d. Popo had courage in that courtroom in Chaguaramas to face down men like Chadee and psychopath Joel Ramiah who tried everything, including killing star witness and crooked police officer Clint Huggins, in an all-or-nothing bid at freedom. Popo provided the prosecution with a timeline for the massacre and a description of the escape car, which would later be found, traced to an owner, and crack the case. His reward from the State after the verdicts were handed down Nothing, till the day he died. Popo never returned to Williamsville, fearing Chadee's sympathisers would kill him for having talked. Instead, he stayed for months outside the San Fernando Police Station where he felt he had a chance to avoid assassins, real or imagined. Popo's home for years was a cubbyhole under the front steps of the law office of former house speaker Nizam Mohammed, across the road from the station. He did odd jobs for food, willing to tell anyone who cared to stop and listen to this limping, ragged, smelly man, about the promises the politicians made then to help him because he helped them. Popo died in the storm drain near the San Fernando General Hospital, living to see Chadee and the gang hang over the course of three days in 1999. Children hid in a bedroom Osmond Baboolal also testified at the trial. He was a 13-year-old when they killed his mother Rookmin, father Deo, sister Monica and brother Hamilton. He was still a child when he testified about that night, of how he and younger sister Haematee lived when everyone else died, hiding in a bedroom while his family died, the blood leaking through the floorboards of the house. Haematie was taken in by an aunt, survived a turbulent adolescence growing up in San Fernando. But she stayed in school, and with the help of two police officers who were part of the Baboolal murder investigation. For Osmond, his childhood ended that night. He was the fifth victim of the Chadee gang. When the killers came, the target was Osmond's bigger brother, Hamilton \\u201cMice\\u201d Baboolal, who had dared steal drugs from Dole. But there could be no witnesses. So Mice, his sister and mother would be executed in the living-room \\u2013 bullets to the head while they begged. The father, who walked into his yard during the massacre, was shot dead on the steps. Osmond heard it all. What he saw after the killers left and before the neighbours and police came into the house, no child should ever witness. Communications adviser to the President Theron Boodan was then a reporter with the Trinidad Guardian. He was the first to the house and captured the now-infamous photograph of Osmond and his sister cowering in a corner of a neighbour's house. Back then, crime scene investigations and a reporter's access were different. Boodan recalled: \\u201cThe old man, he was downstairs on the step, lying there bleeding through the mouth, a wound to the back of the head. Upstairs on the couch were the bodies of the others. There was blood everywhere\\u201d. Boodan found out that the surviving siblings were across the road. \\u201cWe were taken there. They were so scared, shaking. You could have seen terror in their faces. They told me that when the men came and started searching the house and asking for Hamilton, one of (the gang members) found them hiding in one of the rooms. And although he had in instructions to kill everyone, he hid those children.\\u201d Boodan said he never wrote about this in his reporting, but when he covered the murder trial years later, Morris took the stand and testified to hiding Osmond and Haematee from Joey and the others. \\u201cThat is how they survived that night,\\u201d said Boodan. How we failed him Osmond remained in the village and moved back into the death house before it was destroyed in an arson that remains \\u201cunsolved\\u201d. He became something of a freak show (\\u201clook de boy who family Dole kill\\u201d), visited by media at massacre anniversaries for that always interesting \\u201cwhere are they now\\u201d story. This reporter was part of it. And when Chadee and his gang were hanged, Osmond, by then in his 20s and living alone in a shack on land his father once planted, was telling us that it did not matter; it would not bring back his family; the $171 a month being offered by Manohar Ramsaran's Social Development Ministry a joke, that he deserved millions for himself and his sister. Ramsaran replying then, \\u201cBuckle down and try to lead a productive life, and get vengeance out of your mind\\u201d and \\u201cWe are not in the business of making people rich. My ministry is to address the needs of people and assist as we can.\\u201d The village tried to help. The vegetable stall vendor gave him a job. Residents helped him build on land half a mile from the family house that remained empty until the day someone burned it to the ground. Ramsaran never met Osmond, despite having to drive past that shack with then-attorney general Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj, on their way to Chadee's confiscated Piparo mansion they turned into a drug rehab centre. Neither did any of the other politicians, some of whom are still active \\u2013 Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley and Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar included. So Osmond was written off as the village outcast, a dangerous man/boy filled with rage, picking up convictions for beating an uncle, making threats, burglary, and drug possession. He lost his vegetable stall job, began hanging with a bad crowd, and moved so far from \\u201cnormal\\u201d people that he no longer acknowledged anyone during his trip to the standpipe for water to take to his shack. In February 2010, the boy who saw four murdered was charged with trying to murder two schoolchildren, chopping a 15-year-old girl on the head, and a 14-year-old boy on ear. He was remanded to the prisoner section of the St Ann's Hospital. Osmond was supposed to have a two-week psychiatric evaluation. He stayed there for four months. Bail was set at $350,000, with an alternative that if someone could come up with $10,000 cash, he could be released pending his trial. That never happened. By then, there were no relatives still in touch. In November 2011, he was committed to stand trial for the two attempted murders, and told that should he get bail, a condition of his freedom was that he attend a psychiatric outpatient clinic. His lawyer asked the court to use its powers to impress upon the Director of Public Prosecutions to give the matter urgent attention and bring the case to trial, since Baboolal was unlikely to make bail. And that was the last we heard of Osmond. Time tumbled on. The Williamsville atrocity of 1994 was replaced by new ones, new bodies \\u2013 decomposing, burnt, bloodied \\u2013 photographed by whichever person and police officer was first on the scene, and shared on must-see TV at 6 p.m. in a country quick to be outraged, and to forget. We found Osmond and Haematee last month and found out about the tragic and triumphant journey of their lives.

Laventille resident Joyle Morris has vowed to rebuild his home which was partly destroyed by an avalanche of boulders and mud on Sunday. Morris, 69, a retired mason and carpenter, said although it is the rainy season, he will do what can to return to the house he built almost 20 years ago. On Tuesday an engineer from the San Juan/ Laventille Regional Corporation conducted a site visit at the house at Block 22, and this was followed on Wednesday by a crew of labourers who began removing the boulders, mud and debris from the site. Morris said there was \\u201ca lot more work to be done\\u201d, and the labourers are expected to return on Thursday. Morris and his wife, Hermie Morris, 67, who is a cancer survivor, narrowly escaped being crushed beneath mounds of rubble which crashed on their home on Sunday morning. \\u201cWe are coping\\u201d, he said when asked how he and his wife were handling the ordeal. Joyle Morris said his wife was in the kitchen when the land above their 20 year old house slipped away, and if he did not shout at her to get out, she might have been crushed to death. Their kitchen and living room were destroyed. Their 45 year old son who resides with them had just stepped out of the house when the land slipped occurred. Morris said with the earthquake last Tuesday, only stones fell on the house and there was no damage, but five days later there was devastation. Last year his wife was diagnosed with cancer of the uterus, and in May she underwent surgery which was deemed successful. Since then she eats consumes only fruits and was in the kitchen \\u201cjuicing\\u201d fruits when she heard an unusual noise. She ran out of the kitchen and seconds later the room where she had stood was covered in stones and dirt. The bedrooms, bathrooms and porch were intact, he said, and the couple slept there on Sunday and Monday night. On Tuesday, the odour of the food that had deteriorated in the refrigerator was too overpowering and the couple slept at one of their daughter\\u2019s homes a block away. Morris said he was grateful that officials of State agencies were assisting in the cleaning, and promised to help repair the house. \\u201cSo far they have made a good start. If we do it piece by piece we will get it done. But if they dragging their foot I will get it done by myself\\u201d, he told the Express. \\u201cIt is the middle of the rainy season so we have to do things quickly. He said on Tuesday and Wednesday there were bouts of heavy rainfall but no more land slippage. Morris said that he was displeased when told that the he would have to wait for reimbursement from National Self-Help Commission. \\u201cIf someone is in distress and you want to give help, you will give help immediately. Maybe even a week or two. But can\\u2019t have people waiting two and three months and that is what I was told. The man and told me to fill out the \\u2018Self Help\\u201d form said he can\\u2019t give me a time when I will get help. We need immediate help.

Christopher Famous, a government MP who was one of the politicians captured taking a nap, called for a probe. Image via Cana News, 31 July 2018. HAMILTON, Bermuda, July 31, CMC \\u2014 A government backbencher has called for an investigation into the use of cameras in parliament, after photos appeared on social media sites of legislators apparently asleep during House of Assembly sessions. Christopher Famous, a member of the ruling Progressive Labour Party (PLP), who was one of several politicians captured taking a nap, said: \\u201cThe Speaker (Dennis Lister) has to investigate this. It wouldn\\u2019t be appropriate for me to speak on it.\\u201d The Speaker was not immediately available for comment. A video of Opposition Leader Jeanne Atherden, apparently having dozed off, was also posted on an online site, the Royal Gazette newspaper said on Tuesday. Other pictures show MPs slumped in their chairs or with their heads falling forward, apparently with their eyes closed. Among those captured were Minister of Public Works David Burch, as well as PLP backbenchers Kim Swan \\u2013 who denied he was asleep, saying he was looking down into his phone \\u2013 and Dennis Lister III. The images, which appeared to have been taken on smartphones, were met with a mixed reaction online, including criticism, amusement and empathy, the Gazette said. It is not known who took the pictures or when, but the camera angles of some suggested they were taken on the floor of the House, while others as though they were taken from the public gallery, the newspaper reported. PLP chairman Owen Darrel said the images of MPs and their use on social media was \\u201cregrettable and unfortunate\\u201d. A notice to the public \\u201cby order of the Speaker\\u201d in the House makes clear a ban on the use of electronic devices. It states: \\u201cPlease turn off cellular phones and pagers while in the chamber. The use of cameras of all types, tape recording and the reading of newspapers is prohibited.\\u201d The code of conduct for MPs also forbids the use of electronic devices.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"With the Barbados Labour Party\\u2019s record-breaking victory, Mia Amor Mottley has thundered her way into history as the first woman prime minister in the world to take office with her party having won every electoral seat. By the time the polls opened on Thursday morning the wind was already blowing in the BLP\\u2019s favour. By night\\u2019s end, the wind had turned into a thunderous earthquake with the BLP\\u2019s 30-nil victory against the incumbent Democratic Labour Party. In Trinidad and Tobago, political historians would note the significance of the May 24 date and its co-incidence with the victories of Ms Mottley and the BLP on Thursday, May 24, 2018. In the general election of May 24, 1971, Dr Eric Williams and the People\\u2019s National Movement secured a 36-nil victory following an opposition boycott of the elections. Then in the election of May 24, 2010, Kamla Persad-Bissessar was voted in as T&T\\u2019s first ever woman prime minister. For the woman who now shoulders the responsibility of leading Barbados, Thursday\\u2019s win must be as euphoric as it is sobering given the country\\u2019s dire economic and social problems. By all accounts, campaign 2018 was brutal, especially against Ms Mottley. With the BLP challengers drawing increasingly larger crowds, the then governing DLP led by Freundel Stuart began exhibiting signs of desperation with a descent into ugly personal attacks. Not even Ms Mottley\\u2019s sexual orientation was spared as that, too, was dragged onto the DLP\\u2019s platform. For many Barbadians, the attacks on Mia Mottley marked a new low. As the election results would suggest, it was an error for which the DLP was roundly punished by the electorate. For the incoming Mottley administration, the magnitude of the BLP\\u2019s victory presents the additional challenge of governing in the context of what is effectively a one-party state. The likelihood now is that the Governor General, Dame Sandra Mason, may have to step in and appoint a parliamentary opposition. The resounding vote of faith given to Ms Mottley and the BLP by Barbadians comes with high expectations that they have what it takes to pull the country out of its current difficulties. With its prized tourism sector in contraction, the economy shrunk by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2018. At the end of March, the country\\u2019s international currency reserves stood at $423 million, representing a mere 6.9 weeks of import cover. With government debt at 150 per cent of GDP the new administration has precious little room to manoeuvre in delivering on its promises of tax cuts and a stronger social net in support of those in the low-income bracket, pensioners and students among others. Barbadians are not in denial about the state of their economy. They have been feeling the effects of job losses, wage reductions and higher prices long enough to understand that even with the best leadership, there is no magic bullet. Given her previous cabinet experience, which included the finance portfolio, Ms Mottley should have a good grasp of the challenge. Fortunately, she also has the confidence of over 70 per cent of the electorate. One can only wish her, her government and the people of Barbados, well.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"David Abdulah David Abdulah Following the resignation of the the Board's Chairman Dr. Terrence Farrell in January, David Abdulah has quit. This is Abdulah's letter to Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley announcing his resignation - I write on the above captioned subject and hereby formally resign as a member of the Cabinet appointed Economic Development Advisory Board (EDAB). I wish to state at the outset that I appreciate the confidence that the Cabinet and you, in particular, had in me when you decided to appoint me as a member of the EDAB. I trust that in the two years since our appointment in November 2015, I was able to contribute in some measure to the work of the EDAB. As you know, I am a firm believer in the importance of public service, hence my acceptance of the appointment to the EDAB. This was not unique as I have, over many years, given of my time to public service. This has spanned different administrations and parties in office since \\u201cpublic service\\u201d is to the country and not to any \\u201cparty or government\\u201d. Thus, I have served on the Boards of three public bodies \\u2013 the Trinidad and Tobago Bureau of Standards; the Environmental Management Authority; and the Cipriani College of Labour and Co-operative Studies. In addition, I have been a member of several Cabinet appointed Committees including: one to review four state enterprises (during the Panday government); the Vision 2020 Core Group (the Manning administration); the Economic Development Advisory Board and the Petrotrin Review Committee (your administration). There have, of course, been several other areas in which I have done public service including the area of the administration of justice. It is my view that the establishment of the Economic Development Advisory Board, reporting to the Prime Minister as set out in our Terms of Reference and stated in our letter of appointment, is a vital mechanism in the process of arriving at national economic policies. I also hasten to add that good \\u201ceconomic policies\\u201d are never ever confined to the narrow areas of quantitative economics nor are they specific only to fiscal and monetary policies. The work of the EDAB must therefore also connect with social policies as well as matters relative to good governance. It is also vitally important that the work of the EDAB is linked to the work of Government Ministries, Statutory Bodies, State enterprises and other agencies, especially since the EDAB by its nature and terms of reference ought to be looking at the \\u201cbig picture\\u201d and thus engaged in the identification of strategic approaches to economic development. Regrettably, in the two years of our work this interaction with other bodies was not always a reality as there remains the culture of silos and \\u201cpower bases\\u201d. This, together with a lack of direct engagement with and/or the slow response to the recommendations/projects and Advisory Notes submitted by the EDAB led to it being less than optimal in terms of results. An EDAB must be a functional entity, not merely a Committee that gives the public the perception that a government is being proactive in policy development and long term planning. In this regard, it is my own personal position \\u2013 and this was an issue that the EDAB was interrogating \\u2013 that the Economic Development Advisory Board needs to be institutionalized so that it can properly fulfill its mandate. One aspect of this institutionalizing is funding for its professional, technical and administrative staff requirements. Another must be that the work of the EDAB is sustained over time in a way that partisan politics (especially given our electoral cycle) does not interrupt its work since the absence of long term planning and implementation is one of the major reasons for our failure as a country to harness all of our very significant natural, financial and human resources in a common effort at development. This weakness of institutionalizing our efforts was manifest in the EDAB itself when, following the resignation of the Chairman, Dr. Terrence Farrell, in early January of this year, the work of the Board came to a halt. In the absence of a Chair, and with two members having previously resigned the EDAB has been in limbo for the past three months. In such a circumstance and not having received any communication from Cabinet as to the future standing or work of the EDAB, I cannot in good conscience continue to be a member of the EDAB. Once again, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to give public service as a member of the EDAB. I also wish to record my thanks to the very hard-working staff of the EDAB\\u2019s Secretariat who operated at all times in a very professional manner and at a high standard, in spite of the many, very real challenges which they faced. I also wish to state my appreciation to all colleague members of the EDAB and to our Chair, Dr. Farrell, for their time, effort, thought and work which made my experience as a member very interesting.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"President Paula-Mae Weekes. To her left are outgoing president Anthony Carmona, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley and Chief Justice Ivor Archie. -Photo: DEXTER PHILIP President Paula-Mae Weekes. To her left are outgoing president Anthony Carmona, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley and Chief Justice Ivor Archie. -Photo: DEXTER PHILIP The country's sixth President Paula-Mae Weekes was inaugurated on Monday at a ceremony at the Queens Park Savannah, Port of Spain. This is the President's address to the people - Well before the date of assumption of any new position the candidate had better be clear about the job description, \\u2026. with that in mind I first looked at the Constitution and while it outlined certain duties and functions of president, the office holder\\u2019s role was not defined. Then aided by memory, anecdote and available material I analysed the leadership and decision-making styles of my predecessors in office. This unscientific research led me to the conclusion that it falls to each President to define within prescribed limits his or in this case her own role. After much deliberation I identified my role as \\u201chumble first servant\\u201d with the mandate to render service with enthusiasm. As I continued thinking about how I - as President and we - as a nation would navigate the course ahead, I remembered that many years ago after completing several marathons I was looking through a Runner\\u2019s World magazine and saw an article by one of USA\\u2019s foremost authorities on long distance running. He opined that the ideal weight for a female marathoner was 95 to 100 lbs. I haven\\u2019t stopped laughing yet, since at my lightest I was at least twice that and then on more serious reflection I thought, what if I had had this information before undertaking that challenge? Would I have allowed it to stop me? If I had, I would not have stretched myself beyond my then known limits, nor made wonderful friends. I would not have undertaken wild adventures such as attempting to climb a mountain with a name that begins Kill-a-man and perhaps most importantly I would not today be able to look back on that period, which was not without its hurdles - literal and figurative, with a sense of satisfaction, pride and accomplishment. Could this apply to us today? I say \\u201cus\\u201d because I consider that for the period of my tenure, our destinies mine and that of our nation are inextricably linked. Many experts real and armchair, in positions high and low, \\u201cbeset us round with dismal stories\\u201d they tell us that T&T is perilously close to the point of no return - crime, corruption, racism, abysmal public services and an ineffective judicial system, among other problems are so thick on the ground that all hope is lost; that we will soon be, if we are not already there, a failed state, however defined. So how do we respond to these commentators and to our reality? What are we to do? As I see it we have but 2 choices\\u2026.Option 1 - We can lament, blame, criticise and allow a miasma of despair to overwhelm us or Option 2 we can consciously and intentionally choose the alternative. Not wish for - or dream about - or only hope and pray for the alternative, but make up a hard mind and mobilise forces and resources to step out boldly and make TT a better place for us and our children all the while understanding that though faith is a necessity, without action it is useless. Let me confess up front to sharing certain characteristics with Pollyanna - that storybook character filled with irrepressible optimism and a tendency to find good in everything - but I do not now nor have I ever lived in an ivory tower nor worn blinkers. I may have had some advantages that others have not, but having lived in Trinidad & Tobago all my life, I have endured the maddening inefficiencies of the public sector, I too drive with my windows up and doors locked even in broad daylight, I have lost two cars to thieves, and waited hours for medical attention for a relative at POSGH. I know what the murder count is and how many of the victims have been women and children slaughtered in acts of domestic violence, I am cognizant of the volatile tensions in east Port of Spain. I see people affected by mental illness, addiction and homelessness sleeping on the streets and if I needed to get to Tobago in a hurry I could not be certain if or when I would arrive. I comprehend fully the state of the state and so understand why we might have every reason to despair. None of us is blind or foolish enough to deny that Trinidad and Tobago is going through dark times, but I echo the words of C.S. Lewis when I say -\\u201dthis a good world gone wrong but it still retains the memory of what ought to have been\\u201d So, here comes the Pollyanna in me now - it is my mission, mission entirely possible, to infect each and every one of you with a bright and positive spirit as we strive to turn our beloved nation into what it ought to have been and still can be. So let us today choose Option 2 confront the darkness and declare that it will not take over. It is a tenet of most major religions that light triumphs over darkness. Our Hindu community expresses the most visible manifestation with rows of deyas shining on the darkest night to symbolize the triumph of good over evil, of light over darkness. Even the humanists among us, who are of the school of philosophy that believes in human effort and ingenuity rather than religion, will agree that light is best seen in the dark and that it is always darkest just before the dawn. Light always serves a purpose, it directs ships to safe harbour, it illuminates our path, it can lead the way, it purifies, it exposes hidden dangers, promotes clear vision and if legend is to be believed it even repels, vampires, goblins and foul fiends that try to daunt the spirit. What I am saying is not novel at all but as a wise man once said \\u201cpeople need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed\\u201d. Our challenge then is to be light and see light. I use the word challenge deliberately because this mission is not for the fainthearted. If I might loosely borrow some words from the Bard of Avon in Henry V we will need to \\u201cStiffen the sinews, summon up the blood... \\u2026 set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height\\u2026... This will not be accomplished easily or overnight. It is a marathon folks! Whether we set off with a burst of speed or at a crawl there will come periods in which we fade and have to employ the \\u201cjust to the next lamppost\\u201d strategy as we soldier on. But there will also be unexpected surges of energy when we are able to propel ourselves forward with extraordinary vigour. We must not become weary. We must trust that in time we will reap the benefits of our efforts. Being a light does not necessitate grand schemes or accomplishments. A flickering candle can be as effective as a blazing bushfire in the right environment. Be a light in your home, instill discipline, model good behaviour, practise punctuality, honesty and politeness, or in your school, pay more attention to the lesson than to your phone, protect the vulnerable, respect those in authority, be a light in your community, care for your environment, be tolerant of views, beliefs and practices of others, re-imagine and re-engineer the village that it takes to raise today\\u2019s\\u2019 children, you can be a light in your workplace, get to work on time, actually do work while you are there and go the extra mile if need be. On a larger scale you can be a light in your nation. For that we will have to put country first - Before self, family, party, tribe. Let\\u2019s not fool ourselves, at times this will take serious sacrifice. This is the work of patriots. Love for our twin islands has to be planted, nurtured and buttressed day after day after day and the seed must be sown in early childhood. I am always amazed at the way many of us behave as if the national anthem is for our entertainment rather than an opportunity to express afresh our national identity. We don\\u2019t sing and then at the end we applaud. We do not rehearse often enough the nation-building lyrics of God Bless Our Nation and Our Nation\\u2019s Dawning. Don\\u2019t underestimate the value of knowing and regularly repeating those inspirational and aspirational words. Let us not miss the relevance and timeliness of one of our nationals, Len Peters, being awarded in February this year the first Commonwealth Points of Light Award for exceptional voluntary service in protecting endangered turtle species. Recognise too, Gabrielle Branche who won an award from the United World Colleges for an innovative project targeting secondary schools in Trinidad and Tobago. She is reported to have said that if she could do her part to change the mind-sets of everyone towards the environment and encourage others to continue in this vein she would have made a difference. Be inspired by Len, Gabrielle and others to be and to look for points of light. Sometimes that light will be straight ahead, glaring and obvious; at other times we might need to employ peripheral vision and a pair of binoculars, but fear not, it is always present. Even in the midst of the relentless assault on our sensibilities as individuals and as a nation, every day we can find shining examples of all that is good about us. Search them out, encourage and support them in order to spread the glow. Friends, Trinbagonians, Countrymen, I have listened carefully to all that you have said following my election. Your high expectations indicate to me that there is a mustard seed of faith that things can get better in our twin-island republic - and if I read that right - all things, good things are possible for Trinidad and Tobago . As your servant, my promise is that I will work tirelessly, (I\\u2019ll labour night and day) to do my best by word and deed both to be a light and spread the light of others at every opportunity. But if you feel that you are going to leave me alone to do all the heavy lifting, you\\u2019re sadly mistaken. I have something to ask of you\\u2026No, I\\u2019m not asking for a honeymoon period: I well understand that your reservoir of patience with holders of high office has all but run dry. But I am going to rub my imaginary lamp and appeal to the collective genie that you are...Here are my three wishes... First of all I ask you to find ways to make a positive difference in whatever your sphere of influence, not necessarily ambitious designs but rather specific, practical, doable projects - the results of which can be seen and measured in the short term, and then let us celebrate each success. Many individuals and organisations have asked to meet with me. Let\\u2019s not meet just for meeting sake \\u2026 we do not have that luxury. Come armed with your ideas, your feasible projects to improve our quality of life. Nothing will catch my attention faster than a man or woman with a plan. Next, I ask those of you with a platform from which to disseminate your views to find new and creative ways to inspire your audience while reporting responsibly and commenting civilly on the facts and in particular on social media which is here to stay and has great value in giving a voice to those who might otherwise be voiceless but reckless use of this or any communication channel will defeat its very purpose. Is it at all possible to dial down the rhetoric while still adding your 2 cents\\u2019 worth to the discussion on any issue? And last, and before I run out of goodwill, we speak all the time about how violent a society we\\u2019ve become ... true, but the climate of violence is not created or even birthed in overt acts, it\\u2019s embedded in everyday talk, in commonplace interaction... in schools, in the market, in business places, in the rum shop, and worst of all in the home. I ask you to be mindful in your use of language remembering that a soft answer often turns away wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger and that pleasant speech increases one\\u2019s persuasiveness. When we have the inevitable differences of opinion we can do so without the savagery, the ad hominem attacks, the gratuitous insults. In closing, I thank God for his mercies \\u2026 for me the boundary lines have fallen in pleasant places, I have a goodly heritage. I thank the electoral college for its vote of confidence in me. I hope that the unanimity achieved on that occasion will be experienced again and again for the good of country. I thank former President Carmona for his service to the nation and for his consideration and kindness to me in the lead up to his hosting today\\u2019s inauguration. I have known him since the late 70s when as fellow campus calypsonians he was the Prophet of Sissyphus and I Brickhouse, so I expected no less. I thank my mother, family and friends for their unstinting support and regular reality checks. If I ever get too big for my britches I am sure they\\u2019ll cut me down to size. They keep me humble and grounded. And most of all I thank you the people of T&T for your good wishes and prayers as I undertake this awesome responsibility do not let me walk alone.

Rookmin married Mathura Sookhoo at the early age of 12 and moved into her in-laws house. She had 11 children-five boys (two who died) and six girls. She has 40 grandchildren, 83 great grandchildren and is the great-great-grandmother of 12. She lives with her granddaughter Camille Alleyne at Gobin Village, near Buen Intento, Princes Town. According to Alleyne, Rookmin also known lovingly as \\u201cMoi\\u201d does not suffer with any severe ailments besides some memory loss. This is Rookmin having a beer on the beach with family in the US Moi worked at a labourer in the sugar cane fields along with her family. She also planted crops. To this date, she is very active and can be seen working around the house wearing her orahni (female head cloth). Alleyne said: \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want her to over work herself but she will not sit still. She will go to clean the grass in the yard or do something around the house. Someone just has to keep an eye out for her because of how she sometimes forgets things, it can be dangerous. But I am always around with her.\\u201d Being the matriarch to the family, Rookmin is often seen at the homes of relatives lending a helping hand.

This is a piece of misinformation being peddled by Government, Roget said, to try to fool the nation into thinking that the union's call for workers around the country to stay home was sparked by malcontent over the decision to shut down the refinery. Instead, Roget said the union's call to shut down the country on September 7 - the third anniversary in office of the People's National Movement (PNM) government, was made since Labour Day (June 19) this year and is based on Government's failure to keep a number of crucial promises. The OWTU has found support from a number of unions, including the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers' Association (TTUTA), which has called on parents to keep their children away from school on Friday. At a press conference Tuesday morning in downtown Port of Spain, Roget said the Dr Keith Rowley-led administration has failed on several counts including controlling crime, strengthening the economy and doing right by labour. He said the closure of Petrotrin's Pointe-a-Pierre refinery was an issue that cropped up after the call to rest and reflect had long been made but has been instructive as to Government's handling of the economy and employment. Roget disclosed that the OWTU will, on Monday, deliver to Opposition Leader, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, its proposal for the restructuring of Petrotrin. That document was also delivered to Government not long after it took up office but has been ignored by the relevant authorities, the union has said. The board of Petrotrin announced last Tuesday that as it looks to turn around the State-owned company's fortunes, the refinery must go as it has become a financial burden.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"Fellow citizens, good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you on two very important matters each of which has serious far reaching consequences for all the people of Trinidad and Tobago. I refer specifically to the recently announced successful conclusion of the negotiations between our country and Venezuela on natural gas supply and the closure of the Petrotrin refinery. As you would all be aware, Trinidad and Tobago is heavily dependent on our involvement in the natural gas industry by way of the processing and export of natural gas or gas-based products such as methanol, fertilizer and other products. In fact, during the last fifteen years or so our economy has become increasingly much more dependent on the revenues from gas as against earnings from oil. Even more recently we have been experiencing sustained gas curtailment to our Pt Lisas plants and our national reserves have been dwindling. There were even actual plant closures with more concerns looming on the not too distant horizon. In the face of these developments and in this situation, very early in the life of my Government we gave gas supply arrangements the highest focus and priority. We opened and settled a gas price with our upstream companies BP and EOG, resulting in a multi-billion dollar exploration and production frenzy in fields within our borders. We opened, negotiated and settled key outstanding gas contracts with the downstream gas users at Pt Lisas. Even as some new gas is beginning to come on stream and there have been some interesting successes in some new areas, so far we are really working very hard to replace what we are consuming with an eye on overall growing reduction in our reserves. Under these circumstances, we opened discussions with Venezuela to get agreement on access to their large proven gas fields, just across our border. These reserves are economically and logistically more marketable from Trinidad than from Venezuela. Success in such an initiative would provide an extension of our involvement in the gas business while it provides opportunity for Venezuela to monetise some of its gas which otherwise would not get to market in any foreseeable time frame. After diligent work on both sides of the border the agreement which was signed on August 25, 2018 between our National Gas Company (NGC), Shell and PDVSA, for the first time, clears the way for the construction of pipeline infrastructure to allow us access to a Venezuelan gas field. This historic development, built on the time honoured diplomatic principle of good neighbourliness for the benefit of both nations, established a competitive gas pricing mechanism which is sufficiently attractive to excite development of the Dragon field which is north west of us, as well as on the south coast cross border fields which we share with Venezuela. It gives us some potential to grow in the medium term and diversify our gas supply base even as it almost immediately adds to the pool of what is available for current needs. This initiative, for us, is about opening new doors towards securing our future in an increasingly competitive international business. We\\u2019ve done it! As a result of the priority and the attention that we have given it and the successful conclusions which have attended our sustained efforts I can today report to you that our gas industry and our future in this business that is so critical to our well-being, whilst not perfect yet, is in much better shape than it was three years ago. PETROTRIN Trinidad and Tobago, even though small in size, is a significant player on the global stage, especially in the natural gas and petrochemical sector. Over the past decades we moved imperceptibly from oil to gas. However, we are still deeply connected and involved in the production, refining and marketing of oil, a business that has been struggling for quite some time. Such is our involvement in this business, that the liabilities of the state company threaten the credit rating and the very financial stability of the country as a whole. I ask you to recall that in January 2017, in an address to the nation, I invited you to turn your attention to the troubling state of affairs at Petrotrin. At that time I alerted you to the complexity of the issues associated with the company, in particular, how it affected all of us, the citizens, especially from a financial point of view. As an example, the international rating agencies have considered the country\\u2019s sovereign rating status on the basis of the troubled financial status of the oil company and strongly warn of further downgrades if nothing significant is done to improve our position in this worsening exposure. I reminded you that there is a $USD 850 million bond (TTD$6 billion) that is coming due for payment in the form of a single payment in August 2019 and another of almost $ USD 700 million that would be due soon after. It is with mixed feelings, one of sadness and of resolve that I return to this issue today, after months of review, analysis and consultations. As you are aware the future of Petrotrin has been the subject of much negative speculation for the past several months but inevitably we must come to the time of decision making as we are forced to abandon the procrastination and finger pointing which have only served to worsen the eventual outcome. I appreciated the importance of the oil and gas sector to the well being of Trinidad and Tobago before becoming Prime Minister and that is why two of the first actions taken by the Cabinet soon after September 2015 were to appoint the Standing Committee of Energy, the sub-committee of Cabinet charged with the responsibility of deciding and directing policy in the oil and gas industry. We also appointed the boards of directors of both Petrotrin and the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC). On Tuesday 28th August the Board of Directors of Petrotrin, after months of dedication and hard work, in analyses and consultations, met with its employees and their union representatives to announce plans for changes that would be implemented in the coming weeks and months to get the company on a path to sustainable profitability. These measures are expected to stop the taxpayers funding operations that are losing billions of dollars and to stop the haemorrhaging of much valued, and much demanded, foreign exchange, US dollars. The primary objective of the announced interventions is to transform the business of the company from chronic money losing to a return to profitability. To some, these changes may appear drastic, but the situation at Petrotrin requires drastic action. It requires intervention now, in fact before now, but the country\\u2019s decision makers, whilst knowing the problem, shied away from the negative responses that were certain to accompany any corrective action. In short, the Petrotrin fix was always seen to be bad for politics and even one\\u2019s political survival but we have arrived at a place now where its ongoing failure threatens the national survival. Such is my lot. I humbly accept it as the embodiment of the oath of my office, to act \\u201cwithout fear or favour, without malice or ill will\\u201d to any person or group of persons. This Government does not have the luxury of not attending to this age old problem. Time is not on our side. To those whose knee jerk reaction to this very real crisis is to threaten chaos, to burn down the country, to spew invectives, to demonize and toss insults, none of this assists in addressing the issue in any meaningful way. This PNM Government which was responsible for building this country knows that strength and compromise are not mutually exclusive. I would also like to remind our people that we did not always have a refinery and a Petrotrin. We came to this place because a PNM Government in an earlier time took equally far reaching steps to purchase and amalgamate the failing assets of the private sector in visionary leadership to bring about that which we are now called upon to salvage and reposition. In presenting to you the new vision for Petrotrin it is important to describe the journey to this point. The oil industry has and continues to be a major industry in Trinidad and Tobago. It had its early beginnings with the discovery of oil in La Brea in 1857. The discovery of oil created interest among a first wave of companies such as Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields Limited, United British Oilfields of Trinidad (UBOT) and Trinidad Leaseholds Limited (Tll). With production increasing to one million barrels per day a number of refineries including the Point Fortin refinery in 1912 and in 1917 the Pointe-A-Pierre Refinery were established. As Trinidad and Tobago became established as a proven oil province, international oil companies Royal Dutch (Shell), Texaco, British Petroleum and later Tesoro began operations in the country. These IOCs were succeeded by state owned Trinidad and Tobago Oil Company Ltd (TRINTOC) and Trinidad Petroleum Company Ltd (TRINTOPEC) which were merged into the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (Petrotrin). The oil industry in Trinidad and Tobago has a chequered past and has had to adapt to a series of domestic and global factors to ensure its survival. The industry has gone through periods of boom and bust. The initial early success in the 1920s profited from the then oil boom and led to development of new population centres in South Western Peninsula such as Hard Bargain, Retrench and Point Fortin. However, by the 1930s discoveries of large oilfields in the USA contributed to an oversupply situation and a global fall in oil prices. The combination of low oil prices and labour issues contributed to the decline of oil profitability in the domestic economy. The latter period 1940 to 1960 was a period of consolidation and saw the entry of the international oil companies Shell, Texaco and British Petroleum. In the early 1900s there were several small refineries operating in Trinidad, including plants in Palo Seco; Santa Flora; Brighton, La Brea and Point Fortin. These were all closed over time as they became non-viable, either because of aging technology or supply and cost challenges. The Point Fortin refinery was the last to be shut down in 1990 to make way for Atlantic LNG as Trinidad and Tobago shifted its emphasis from oil to natural gas. Following a period of growth, the industry was beset by rising costs, competition from supplies of low cost crude from the Middle East and Africa and construction of new refineries in Europe and the United Kingdom. This led to a decline in production, prices, and the subsequent withdrawal, first by Shell, and then Tesoro and Texaco from the domestic energy sector. Oil refining started in Point a Pierre in 1917 with a production of 1200 barrels per day (bpd) and by the 1980\\u2019s Texaco, the owners of the refinery with a supply of oil from all over the world took production up to 355,000 bpd, much of it fuel oil which was in great demand in those days. By 1984 this refining business was in trouble and losing money, facing closure by the international oil giant. It was against this background of uncertainty and even despair that on August 30th 1984, under Prime Minister George Chambers, the already antiquated and failing refinery was purchased for $189.2 million of which $98m was paid in cash and the balance paid in refined product over a ten month period. In March 1985, a few months after we bought the Texaco refinery, an article in the New York Times reported, \\u201cThe Government agreed to buy the money-losing refinery, officials say, mainly to save more than 3000 jobs.\\u201d It was against this background that our negotiating and advisory team which included, Dodderidge Alleyne and Euric Bobb, two of our most distinguished sons of this nation, advised that the refinery throughput be immediately cut back to 120,000 bpd and it was noted even then that there was a need for refinery upgrade to reduce the high yield of fuel oil. Today with a refining capacity of 140,000 bpd the local production available for refining is 40,000 barrels. We really depend mostly on a daily importation of 100,000 bpd which we refine at a significant and constant loss. With the help of in-depth analyses by local and foreign expertise we have looked at a number of operational business models for the refinery operations and they all indicate that the refinery is and will continue to be an increasing money loser. In fact the analyses show that the rest of the company, Exploration and Production, if operated properly and separated from the refinery it could be a good business which could produce handsome dividends to the shareholder, the taxpayers of Trinidad and Tobago. It is this advice that has finally been accepted by the Cabinet after about a year of intensive work. Within hours of the last meeting with the Board to sign off on the acceptance of this direction and on this decision to close the refinery and get out of the oil importation business, I as Prime Minister, requested a meeting with the majority trade union, the venerable OWTU. This meeting took place at the Office of the Prime Minister on Tuesday 21st August, 2018.Tough as it was and emotive as the situation is, in the presence of a group of Ministers and public servant and a seven man Executive group from the union, the Government outlined the whole scenario of the conclusion of the yearlong exercise and indicated to some surprise that in order to meaningfully restructure the company the refinery operations must cease. There is no gainsaying the fact that we have benefited well from the Chambers Government purchase in 1984 but we have been struggling with the refinery since then. In the meantime as our oil production fell consistently the cost of operations increased virtually uncontrollably and we basically operate a refining business which is largely dependent on foreign oil inputs. All the other refineries in the region which had this same business model, in Curacao, Aruba and St Croix, have long since closed because they saw it as not a viable business. In Trinidad and Tobago we soldiered on and took the opportunity to the furthest that we could carry it and that is where we are now. Permit me a moment, this evening, to share with you, the stakeholders, the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago, who are the owners of Petrotrin, why these changes are necessary now and how we got to the decisions that were announced last week. The Petrotrin from TEXACO Sadly, the new entity Petrotrin which was entrusted with the country\\u2019s proven oil reserves has failed to fully deliver on our expectations. There have been many instances and/or arrangements which can only be described as gross mismanagement of the national patrimony. Every project within the past few decades has been subject to massive cost overruns and lengthy delays. The Gasoline Optimization Programme, which in 2005 was estimated at a cost of US$350 million (approx TTD$2.450 Billion), was completed in 2013 at a cost of US$1.8 billion (approx TTD$12.6 billion). Its Gas to Liquid Project, which originally estimated at a cost of US$165 million (approx TTD$1.155 billion), was abandoned after Petrotrin had incurred in excess of US$450 million (approx TTD$3.150 billion) and its assets were recently sold for US$35 million (approx TTD$245 million). The latest of these projects the Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel Project was estimated to cost US$113 million (approx TTD$791 million) and to date Petrotin has expended US$413 million (approx TTD$2.891 billion). Whilst the project is 98% mechanically completed it cannot be operated because the structural specifications were not adhered to, meaning the foundation is faulty and cannot be used and what is worse no one nor any entity has been held accountable for this expensive travesty. The cost to rectify this omission is estimated at US$350 million (approximately TTD$2.450 billion), money which we do not have and cannot easily borrow. Unfortunately, the nightmare does not end with these disastrous projects, the company now borders on insolvency as its cost of operations far exceeds its revenue. Survival has only been possible through the non-payment of taxes and royalties owing to the Government as well as the procuring of Government guarantees for loans from financial institutions. On its assumption of office in 2015 the Government recognized that Petrotrin would be a major challenge. Therefore, as stated, one of the earliest decisions of this administration was to appoint a broad-based Committee, chaired by Energy expert Selwyn Lashley, former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Energy. It also included Labour representatives and Leroy Mayers, former Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. They were to do an overview of the situation and make recommendations. Following upon the Lashley report being submitted to the Energy Sub Committee of the Cabinet it was subjected to separate review and deeper analysis by the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Finance and by Petrotrin itself. Subsequent to the report of all these entities a new Board was appointed with a mandate to review the entire state of affairs of the company and come up with a clear business plan for its turnaround. This work has been done. In 2016 the management of Petrotrin provided an update on the company\\u2019s operations and its financial situation. The presentation was not re-assuring and highlighted the following: Cash flow Challenges - the then current global prices for crude and petroleum products impacted negatively on Petroleum operations and as result the company was seeking a guarantee for short term working capital credit support. At the end of 2015 short term loans already amounted to US$715 million (approx. TTD$5.005 billion). Deficient Asset Integrity- The deficiencies have been reflected in major spills. The sum of $7 billion was estimated for the required upgrade and maintenance work for plant, equipment and installations. La Brea, the Gulf of Paria, the southwestern peninsula and the Venezuelan territory have already experienced this nightmare. Declining land and marine production- Oil production averaged 45,000 barrels per day and to this day continues decline. This decline was partially due to the company\\u2019s cost of exploration and production and also due to the use by the company of its cash resources on the refinery side including that purchase of approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, instead of using the cash on exploration and production. Manpower - the company was heavily overstaffed and there were deficiencies in technical competencies in key disciplines. Manpower costs then accounted for about 47% of recurrent expenditure and the company was exploring a reduction in staffing. Financial Forecast - Management projected a loss of $648 million in 2016 and return to profit of $635 million by 2020. Debt was projected to fall from $12.3 billion in 2016 to $7.2 billion by 2020. The actual loss for 2016 turned out to be not $635m but $4.3 billion. Management\\u2019s projections were far removed from reality. Unfortunately, this kind of disconnect from reality is shared by other key elements of the equation. The Lashley Report of June 2017 was received by a Government, alarmed by the deteriorating financial position of Petrotrin. The situation cried out for intervention and restructuring That Lashley Team\\u2019s assessment of Petrotrin is instructive and outlined the following: \\u00b7 Petrotrin\\u2019s oil production has been in steady decline. \\u00b7 That Petrotrin was overburdened with debt. The net debt at financial year-end 2015 amounted to $11.4 billion. Government provided guarantees for short term loans of US$230 million (approximately TTD$1.610 billion) to support its operations and to meet financial obligations. \\u00b7 Taxes and royalties owed to Government amounted to $3.1 billion as at February 28, 2017.viz the company was not complying with the tax laws and even when it collected taxes from companies that paid their taxes to Petrotrin for onward transmission to the Ministry of Finance Petrotrin was huffing and utilizing those monies in its own operations. \\u00b7 The company was unprofitable and the outlook was for a worsening of operations unless there was a significant capital injection (which could only come from the Government which in its current financial situation is in no position to undertake these kinds of bailout expenditures). \\u00b7 There was a need for a paradigm shift in the governance and management of Petrotrin. Based on its findings the Team submitted two recommendations: \\u00b7 The imposition of governance arrangements, which allow for transparency and accountability, including the selection of Members of the Board, and the company be managed as competitive business, aimed at becoming a viable entity. \\u00b7 The company be restructured as three independent business units, namely Trinmar, Land Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing. In keeping with Government\\u2019s commitment to transparency a meeting was held by the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries with the OWTU which was led by its President General on Wednesday 19th July 2017 where the Report was discussed. At the meeting the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries outlined the unsatisfactory financial position of Petrotrin which for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 included the following: \\u00b7 Trinmar loss of $124 million; \\u00b7 Refining and Marketing loss of $1.038 billion; \\u00b7 Working Capital Deficit of $6.577 billion; and \\u00b7 Royalty and Taxes to Government of $3.220 billion owed to the Ministry of Finance under law. The Minister also shared with the OWTU the recommendations of the Lashley Committee for the restructuring of Petrotrin. The OWTU supported the idea of restructuring Petrotrin into Business Units, the need for greater accountability and the strengthening of the Board of Directors. It is noteworthy that in 2017 the company\\u2019s auditors advised that it write off over $4 billion in accumulated losses. This had a serious impact on Petrotrin\\u2019s balance sheet at a time when it was already financially crippled. Following its review, Cabinet in September 2017 accepted the Report and recommendations of the Lashley Committee for the restructuring of Petrotrin. The details and specifics of that restructuring was now to be worked out and actioned Cabinet also agreed that: \\u00b7 The restructured Petrotrin must be managed and governed as a competitive business, aimed at becoming a sustainable profitable entity. \\u00b7 The company engage the recognized Trade Union representing the employees of Petrotrin to discuss cost reduction and survival strategies required for the company to continue. In order to treat with this very serious and urgent assignment by September 2017 the Government of Trinidad and Tobago appointed a new Board of Directors at Petrotrin and gave it a clear and specific mandate \\u2013\\u2013 to identify the specific problems at Petrotrin and take the steps necessary to make the Company sustainable and profitable. Prior to the appointment of the new board of Petrotrin, I informally invited the President General of the OWTU to discuss the way forward for Petrotrin, in anticipation of the outcome of the work of the new Board but unfortunately this invitation was declined. It has always been my principle in dealing with Petrotrin to engage all stakeholders and provide us all with opportunities to work together to find solutions. I also invited Labour to sit on the new board of Petrotrin but that too was declined. It should also be noted that when the Government hosted, at the Hyatt, the Spotlight on the Energy Sector, once again the OWTU declined, on the grounds that they were not invited. Notwithstanding these responses, the Government stayed focused on the task ahead and on which it was firmly engaged. The Report of the Team (the Lashley Committee) appointed to Review the Operations of Petrotrin and make Recommendations for its Restructuring was laid as a Paper in the House of Representatives and referred to the Joint Select Committee on Energy Affairs on Friday November 10, 2017. The Committee discussed the Report at a number of meetings, which included public hearings with both Petrotrin and the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries. Now that the actual decisions have been taken in keeping with the recommendations and reviews, professional experts\\u2019 overviews and detailed analysis it is disingenuous for any person, especially those involved, to plead lack of transparency and suddenness of government action which should now be set aside in favour of \\u201cconsultation\\u201d and \\u201cParliamentary\\u201d discussion. These calls are nothing but self-serving, stalling tactics and political subterfuge, intended to maintain the status quo, even as the company sinks daily into a deeper quagmire and the whole country\\u2019s financial situation becomes more exposed to disastrous downgrade if the Petrotrin problem is not addressed. Petrotrin is Trinidad and Tobago\\u2019s largest state enterprise. It operates in the industry that has been the country\\u2019s lifeblood for more than a century. It has within its portfolio some of Trinidad and Tobago\\u2019s most prized land and offshore oil and gas acreage. This is a company that is supposed to be one of the major contributors to the national economy. When such an enterprise is losing money to the point where it can\\u2019t comply with the law, we have a major problem. As I said before, Petrotrin has become, for some time now, a ward of the treasury instead of a contributor to the treasury. What this situation means is this: a) money that the company should turn over to the ministry of Finance is held within the company for its own use (illegal) b) money that is with the Ministry of Finance and needed to service the Health Sector, Social Service and other national priorities has to go to the Petrotrin to keep it afloat. This reflects itself in shortages of health care staff, insufficient medicine in the hospitals, reductions in CDAP and similar deprivations. In the Education sector we have many schools where construction has been stalled for want of funds and overall, contractors who did development works for the state, are owed hundreds of millions which we are struggling to pay so that children all over the nation can get their education in a safe and comfortable environment. There are urgent sustained priorities in National Security where we have had to ground four helicopters because we cannot afford to pay the millions to maintain them. In the Social Services sector, we are unable to provide an extra dollar to the vulnerable people who need it most, nor can we bring a few more needy persons onto the programs even though their circumstances warrant the assistance. We are having difficulty convincing Public Servants that they cannot look forward to any significant pay increases since the money is just not there to do so at this time. Yet the Minister of Finance is having to backstop huge losses at the refinery with little or no hope of recovery. So you see fellow citizens this is not just a Petrotrin issue. We are all in this together. We have all been paying towards the losses and debt that I mentioned. We are all paying to keep the bad situation going and we will all benefit when we fix it. The current Board of Petrotrin sought to get a thorough understanding of the situation at the company and worked with \\u2018best in class\\u2019 advisors and petroleum industry experts \\u2013 both local and international \\u2013 to determine possible options given the company\\u2019s critical financial state and its deteriorating assets. This is an opportune moment for me to tell you that the nine member board of Petrotrin is one of the most qualified and experienced state enterprise boards, despite suggestions otherwise. From the onset it was apparent that while there was some potential on the Exploration and Production side of the business, Refining & Marketing was at best marginal. The refinery was losing money on every barrel of oil it refined. In December 2017, the new Board met with the Government to present its findings and later met with Petrotrin\\u2019s Unions and its employees to do the same. The Government also met with the OWTU and other unions in February 2018 and amongst the issues discussed it was indicated to the Unions, including the OWTU, that the Government was intending to have a public symposium with representatives of the business community, labour and government to discuss the energy sector, this was the \\u201cSpotlight on Energy\\u201d. It was intended that the state of Petrotrin should be addressed at the Spotlight on Energy; unfortunately, labour advised that this seminal event should not be held and refused to attend or participate in this national discussion. Labour was the first stakeholder body to be informed of this intended initiative. It was recognized that the company and unions had a common interest with respect to the survivability, sustainability and profitability of Petrotrin. Notwithstanding its profitability in the distant past, the Company and the Unions understood that Petrotrin must become competitive within the principle of international benchmarks to be profitable. Petrotrin\\u2019s business model has become obsolete and uncompetitive and its operating practices are inefficient. The company was nowhere in line with global industry standards and best practice. In fact the company\\u2019s operations are identified as being among the most inefficient in the world. Left as it is, Petrotrin will require an immediate $25 billion cash injection just to stay alive. There is no way that the company can find this money. No financier will lend it because the company simply will not be able to repay such an additional loan. The Government certainly cannot ask you, the taxpayers, under our current circumstances to bank-roll this state of affairs. If not fixed, on this scale, the company is projected to continue accumulating losses at a rate of about $2 billion a year. Maintenance of the status quo is not sustainable. It is unfortunately not a viable option. To do so is to saddle future generations with a massive debt burden and, at the same time, undermine the government\\u2019s ability to fund urgent and necessary infrastructural works and social development. This affects every citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. If not dealt with now, the negative effects will simply just continue to get worse by the accumulation of more debt. To get the refining side of the business to a point where it might have a chance to break even would cost $7 billion. This would involve significant staff cuts, huge assumptions regarding efficiency improvements, a new Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel facility and infrastructure upgrades, all of which are impossible to finance. The Government\\u2019s vision is for Petrotrin to be profitable and internationally competitive and a leader in the local energy sector; an employer of choice and a source of national pride. The Board is developing a model for Petrotrin that is designed specifically to manage its assets to yield the most value for Trinidad and Tobago. The company will be better structured, with improved work processes and the capacity to respond quickly to changes in the international market. Our Point a Pierre refinery is a hundred and one years old and has reached the end of its commercially viable days. It is now at a stage where it is haemorrhaging cash and the cost of rehabilitating it is way more than its potential to ever be profitable, competitive or sustainable. The only commercially sound and viable option is to close the refinery; export Petrotrin\\u2019s oil which will be produced by an efficient and aggressive exploration programme and to import products to replace those previously supplied by the Point a Pierre refinery. This will move the company from a state of chronic money losing to one which will turn a tidy profit for the taxpayers. The refining assets of Petrotrin can now be put in a separate company for opportunity attention. The OWTU will be given the first option to own and operate it on the most favourable terms. The decision to close the refinery was taken after detailed analysis and deep introspection. This is not a decision that was made lightly or easily. Options were explored and reviewed. We sent the board back on a number of occasions to consider different scenarios and possibilities. At every step the effect on workers and their families and the communities that rely on refinery operations was considered. Workers and Contractors The Government is acutely aware of the traumatic effect of this development on all the workers, their families and the wider fence line communities such as Marabella, Point-a-Pierre, Gasparillo, San Fernando and surroundings. In order to minimise the overall negative effects of this inevitable decision to get out of refining the Government will ensure that the workers who are surplus to the requirement of the renewed effort leave the company with an attractive separation package that should be well received and backed up by the assured pension payments to come. The wider population in these fence-line communities will benefit from some deliberate additional Government expenditure on infrastructure and social support. Everyone involved in this process is acutely aware of the very significant impact that these the decisions will have on Petrotrin\\u2019s employees and their families. The difficult fact is that we had no choice. To have left the company as it was would have only made the situation worse. The decision would have been taken out of our hands and we would not have been in a position to cushion the effect of the changes. By moving to fix the company now, we are in a position to treat employees with care and concern by softening the effects of the required adjustments. The company will treat every employee with dignity and provide services such as financial advice and employee assistance programmes for psychological support. Workers are expected to receive significant financial packages upon ties being severed with the company. In Refining and Marketing, approximately 1700 permanent workers will be affected. In Exploration and Production, employment levels are to be reduced from 1700 workers to approximately 800 persons. A large number of these workers, those over 50, may be able to exit by way of attractive early retirement packages. As the company now focuses on significant expansion of exploration and production activities, this will positively impact the communities of the south western peninsula. It will be a significant re-invigoration of the oil economy in these areas bringing much new or expanded business not just for Petrotrin but opportunities for the many service companies which will be associated with this new business model. In the coming weeks the Government will take part in the announcement and participation in at least two significant industrial projects in the southwestern peninsula. Initiatives like these will certainly contribute to the new beginning that we are working towards. Increased drilling and production works, both on land and offshore, are to be expected in the new business model. There will be increased use of service contractors and suppliers and this should cushion the effects of loss of some opportunities at the refinery. National Fuel Supply Trinidad and Tobago consumes less than 25,000 barrels of refined products a day (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc.). The detailed economic analyses have shown that it makes far more sense for us to export the 40,000 barrels of oil that we currently produce and import the fuel we need. The company will now focus on increasing the production of barrels of oil and each barrel will be sold externally on the open market. This will help to improve the country\\u2019s earning potential. In catering for the nations needs the company will move smoothly into bunkering of refined products for supplying the regional market without having to lose money through our own refinery inefficiencies. This week\\u2019s announcement is a first step in that direction, it is now for everyone involved \\u2013\\u2013 the leadership, the employees, suppliers, contractors, lease operators and labour representatives to transform this potential into reality. With the termination of the Refining business and the redesign of Exploration and Production, Petrotrin can now independently finance all of its debt and become a sustainable business. It will also ease the burden on the Ministry of Finance thereby making more resources available to service the needs of the wider population in all areas of national development. There is opportunity for new entrepreneurship to grow and workers and businesses should not be misled and fall prey to misinformation and fear mongering. Change like this is always difficult and even traumatic; but the good of the country must look ahead. We see this as an opportunity to save the country from financial disaster and turnaround a situation that had become an unsustainable drain on taxpayers. But let us not be na\\u00efve, there are elements in our society who do not view this change the same way but see it as an opportunity to further their own ends in mischief making. I am appealing to all those directly or indirectly affected to be strong and have faith in your country. I want to give you the assurance that the same resolve that took us to make the decision to close the refinery is the same strength of character which will see this Government put your anxiety ahead of any other consideration and will undertake to allocate resources so that calm and prosperity will soon return to you and your neighbourhoods. During this difficult period of transition and uncertainty there will be those who have different views on the way forward; this is only natural; it is important that everyone who works for or with Petrotrin remains committed to operating in the best interest of all the people of Trinidad and Tobago and acknowledge their obligation to the nation. We appeal for the understanding and support of all contractors and employees (permanent; temporary or casual) at this critical time in the company\\u2019s history. Unnecessary work stoppages and other contrived industrial actions are not in the nation\\u2019s best interest. This will only obstruct the already embattled company, and delay this irreversible and unavoidable process geared towards converting a money losing company into a profitable enterprise for the benefit of the entire nation. It is my sincere hope that you will recognize the implications that such action can have on our stakeholders, including those to whom we are heavily indebted and ask that you make the best decision not just for you but for your children. Let us all work together to make the Petrotrin the success it can be. I am confident all persons will place national interest at the forefront and that the re-invented Petrotrin will assume its rightful place in the oil and gas sector of Trinidad and Tobago. God bless you. May God continue to bless Trinidad and Tobago. Thank you for your attention.

IF you were born in the village of Garth Road, Princes Town, you probably heard about the \\u201cwhite man\\u201d tomb on Dragon Hill. But you also knew to keep far from it, given the number of jumbies, lagahoos and assorted local ghosts the old folks said were floating around up there, just waiting to follow you home. That hill also had the respect of the cane farmers who plough and planted the land, but who left untouched the gravesite in that bamboo grove. And for this, we are thankful, because it preserved a place that has opened the door to a lost piece of the island\\u2019s past. The tomb of concrete, marble, fire bricks, and cast iron railing, we discovered, was erected there by Henry Stewart to mark the burial spot of his young wife and two infant children, who all died between 1842 and 1844. Stewart was a resident planter and slave owner who, when emancipation was proclaimed in 1834, continued his sugar business using the labour of the Indentured Indian immigrants at least until the 1850s when he passes out of the historical records. How Stewart and his doomed family came to live and die in the south Naparimas of Trinidad is a story that time had erased, it appears. But Dragon Hill has other secrets to share, and one of it we found last month, by accident (or intuition) mere metres from the Stewart family\\u2019s tomb. Hidden behind a tangle of bamboo, and reaching through a carpet of dried leaves, were broken bits of blackened stone bearing the name - JANE. She has been there for almost 200 years. This is why. It starts in the slave-labour cotton plantations of North Carolina in 1770s, during the American Revolutionary War, as the patriots fought the British to win their independence from the Crown, while also battling the Loyalists - the Americans who remained faithful to the British Empire. Among those who stayed faithful to King George III was the Williams\\u2019 family, who rounded up their slaves and moved to Florida until it became Spanish territory. So they would move on to the British-owned islands of the Bahamas (north of Cuba) where the Williams\\u2019 brothers were granted lands to start a plantation on an island known as Watlings (now San Salvador). Here, one of the brothers, Burton Williams, amassed more than 300 slaves by the early 1800s. But according to the historical records, Williams claimed that his cotton fields were not prospering in the lean soil of the island and he couldn\\u2019t afford to feed or cloth them for much longer. So in 1821, Williams was granted land in British-owned Trinidad which was then offering inducements to planters to relocate to this island and develop its plantation economy. And over a period of two years, the cargo of 324 human livestock would be shipped across the West Indies by Williams. Our ancestors would have arrived, no doubt, off San Fernando, and be marched miles inland across mud roads made impassable during the rains, to their new place of misery. Three estates were developed by Williams for his sons, including Picton (near present day Debe) and Cupar Grange (near Victoria Village, San Fernando). The largest one (300 acres) he named in his honour \\u2013 Williamsville, which bordered the estate of Garth, south of what, is now Princes Town. This area of Savanna Grande in the fertile south Naparimas, is where Williams settled, building his plantation mansion on a hilltop, and overseeing the clearing of the woodland for the planting of sugarcane and for a cattle farm. Some evidence of this is still found by farmers tilling the surrounding land - bricks, broken pottery, coins and rusted metal of early buildings and sugar works. A silo on an abandoned cattle farm near Dragon Hill. Evidence of the lives of the Williams\\u2019 slaves was also preserved in the records of the British, and documented by researchers who found that in Trinidad, they suffered ailments, a poorer diet, lower birth rate, and broken family life on a scale much higher than when he lived on their Bahamas island prison. Some of these slaves would be returned to the Bahamas. Of those who remained, some survived to see Emancipation, allowing them to walk off the plantations and start their own settlements (one given the name Hard Bargain, after two such settlements in the Bahamas). As for Burton Williams, history records him as living a remarkably long life for the time, but suffering an ultimately miserable demise. As part of the British Empire\\u2019s emancipation compensation to the slave owners for the loss of their assets, he was paid 851 pounds, eight shillings and one pence for the 80 slaves he owed in the Bahamas. One of his sons, Sir Edward Eyre Williams, ended up becoming a celebrated high court judge in Australia, after collecting his Trinidad slave money. Another ended up in a \\u2018lunatic asylum\\u2019 in Kensington, London, so someone else had to claim his share of the spoils, according to the records. As for old man Burton, his Williamsville estate would be acquired by Henry Stewart who, of course, would endure his own personal torment. And Burton Williams would return to Watling\\u2019s Island (San Salvador) in the Bahamas, never to see Trinidad again.

Source: Tripadvisory Much has been written about this \\u2018Last Loyalist\\u2019 in a book titled \\u2018Homeward Bound, A History of the Bahamas Islands (Sandra Riley)\\u201d where it is recorded: \\u201cReduced from affluence to poverty, Burton Williams eventually outlived all his sons to die at age eighty-three at Watlings in July 1852\\u201d, and \\u201cForeseeing that there might be no tools left with which to dig his own grave when he died he had dug it ahead of time, one of the limestone ridge. His foresight was wise for when this once energetic and rich man died at an advanced age, a Negro servant who only needed to shovel away the light leaf mold from the waiting grave\\u2026\\u201d. The researchers also suggested that the wife of Burton Williams, whom he married in April 1797, was buried next to him in that grave on San Salvador, which has become a tourist attraction. They were wrong about that. Express writer Richard Charan, and fellow explorer Rajiv Budhooram put the pieces together. What we found buried in the leaves on Dragon Hill is the shattered marble tombstone, sitting atop of a bed of bricks, dating, most likely, to 1822. So we dug it out of the ground, and put the pieces together. The gravestone reads: SACRED, IN THE MEMORY OF JANE, WIFE OF BURTON WILLIAMS ESQ, DIED SEPTEMBER AGED 42.

Kimberly Percell, her step daughter Ameena Boisselle, and Jennifer Garcia all of Valencia said they discarded the receipts for the items. They also said that they were unable to return to the supermarket to get copies of their bills as they were unable to locate the grocery. They said the day they made the purchases, they had gotten lost. It was last week Friday that Percell, 35, Boisselle, 23 and Garcia, 30 were taken before the San Fernando Magistrate to account for the 14 tins of ghee, two tins of baby milk, seven bottles of coffee, the pack of rice, bottle of jam, dishwashing detergent, fruit juices and cashew nuts, scattered on the floor and back seat of the car. Three bags containing more grocery were also found in the trunk. Two cases of water were also found in the car. The three were stopped in a vehicle while along SS Erin Road, Debe on Thursday. Police officers with the grocery items on their way to court. Photo: TREVOR WATSON Constable Roopchand, took the women before the court to account for the items which were believed to have been unlawfully obtained. Roopchand gave evidence that he saw the items in the back seat and the trunk of the car and the manner they were package raised suspicion. He also said the women were unable to produce receipts. The women\\u2019s car was stopped after officers were told that three women were earlier acting suspiciously at a supermarket in Debe. They three mothers who are home-makers, were represented by attorney Ainsley Lucky. They were placed on bail on Friday and told to return with their receipts. On Monday, they produced a bill for one case of water from a grocery in Tableland. In giving evidence they said they went to two groceries on the day they made the purchases. The women said they could not recall the groceries they had visited as they had gotten lost. Percell said she discarded her other receipts while Boiselle said she threw hers away after it was damaged by bleach which fell in a bag. They said they had gone for a drive after visiting Percell\\u2019s mother in Claxton Bay and they bought items at two groceries after they found that the prices were reasonable. They said at a grocery in Debe they were followed by security guards and also searched but were allowed to leave the establishment. In making his submissions, Lucky said the items were heavy and the women would not have been able to leave a grocery without being noticed. He also said there were loopholes and doubts were raised in the matter. Police prosecutor Cleyon Seedan said the women did not give an address to Roopchand for him to make checks at the grocery and also that the women gave conflicting information about the manner the items were in the car. Seedan said the items which were shown in court, cost approximately $1,800. The magistrate said she was satisfied that the women could not give a satisfactory account for how they got the items.

Two men including a SRP police officer and a labourer will appear before a San Fernando Magistrate on Tuesday charged with the abduction of Pollanis on September 6, 2018 TWO MEN \\u2013 a Special Reserve Police office, and a labourer \\u2013 are to appear in the San Fernando magistrates\\u2019 court on Tuesday for the kidnapping of San Fernando mother Natalie Pollonais. They were charged on Monday night after detectives were given instructions from the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard. Two other men \\u2013 a police constable and another man \\u2013 remain in police custody as enquiries continue into the kidnapping. Pollonais was rescued on the night of September 10 after four days in captivity. Officers of the Organised Criminal Intelligence Unit (OCIU) and the Anti Kidnapping Unit (AKU) retrieved Pollonais in El Socorro, San Juan. An SRP and a police constable were arrested at the La Romaine Police Post that same night. Police intercepted a white AD wagon and detained the driver of an Nissan AD wagon suspected to be the vehicle in which Pollonais was being moved around. The AD wagon was taken to the Special Evidence Recovery Unit in Cumuto for testing for forensic evidence. The 47 year old woman left the gym on September 6 around midday driving her white BMW PDS 8716 out of the C3 compound when her vehicle was intercepted by the kidnappers. Pollonais thanks cops On Monday, Police Commissioner Gary Griffith disclosed that Pollonais had written to him, thanking him and the Police Service for returning her to her family. \\u201cHow do you thank the men and women who have given you back not only your life but your very heart and soul,\\u201d Pollonais wrote. \\u201cMy faith in Trinidad and Tobago was restored on Monday 10th when I became keenly aware of the intelligence, coordination of resources, tactical efforts, courage and dedication that was implemented by all in order for me to go home to my family. A simple statement for some, but for me it was everything,\\u201d Pollonais said. With Pollonais\\u2019 approval, Griffith read the contents of the letter at a breakfast seminar hosted yesterday by the Greater Tunapuna Chamber of Industry and Commerce, at the Centre of Excellence, Macoya. Pollonais said her rescue showed how \\u201cunbreakable a bundle of sticks is\\u201d but she said she was deeply saddened that citizens still wanted to stand apart and \\u201cseparate the bundle\\u2019. \\u201cWhen do we stop being East Indian, Chinese, African, Syrian and white? When will we just be Trini. Like you, I pray for that day because it is a day we will begin to heal,\\u201d Pollonais stated. Pollonais went on to thank Griffith\\u2019s wife and the family members of officers who she said \\u201cwent without their husbands, wives and parents\\u201d so she could be rescued. \\u201cI am humbled by their sacrifice,\\u201d she said. She went on to joke: \\u201cI would like to say that I will stop at the next roadblock, after ensuring that all the necessary parameters have been met, such as two or more marked police vehicles, several police in official uniform and the like. However, I hope that it is a speed trap and after all that has happened I may get a bligh.\\u201d Pollonais was kidnapped on September 6 after leaving the Central Athletic Club, at the C3 Complex, San Fernando. She was rescued by police four days later. Two police officers were detained in relation to the crime. Griffith said yesterday he could not give the assurance that other officers would not commit similar acts or that such a situation will never happen again, but he will ensure that \\u201ceach and every time there is a situation like this we will not cover it up\\u201d. \\u201cAny police officer that is held for any situation that is illegal, unethical and is outside of their role and function as a Police Officer that affects you the citizen, we intend to deal with it,\\u201d he said. He said his major task was getting the public to regain confidence in the Police Service. He there were currently over 300 police officers on suspension, most of whom were on three-quarter pay. Griffith said those officers have cost taxpayers over $50 million. He said while he would not trample on the rights of officers, for far too long emphasis was placed on fighting for the rights of rogue elements and not for the rights of law-abiding citizens. On another note, Griffith said he will place emphasis on training police officers to understand the importance of customer service. He referred to a television advertisement in which a police officer was portrayed as being arrogant, obnoxious and high-handed. One another note, Griffith urged police officers to exercise flexibility, maturity and understanding when dealing with the public. \\u201cIf someone is taking their wife to hospital and it\\u2019s an emergency and they are going on the Priority Bus Route and they are stopped and then given a ticket, that is the height of stupidity by any police officer who would do that,\\u201d he said.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"Today\\u2019s university graduates would be justified in feeling they have been led up the proverbial garden path in having grabbed the opportunity for free education in the hope of equipping themselves for jobs in their fields of interest. For thousands, the expectation of landing a job is coming up against the hard reality of an economy that is shedding jobs, possibly faster than it is creating them. Where opportunities exist, they lie mostly at the bottom of the job ladder in minimum wage positions, or at the top where experience is required. This week, Education Minister Anthony Garcia all but threw his hands up in advising medical graduates to seek their fortunes abroad. Echoing the well-worn statements of successive ministers, Mr Garcia trotted out references to planned curriculum revision for equipping graduates for jobs in the new economy: digital media, logistics and supply chain management, animation and gaming design, green engineering, innovation, entrepreneurship and so on. Meanwhile, he said his ministry was working with the Ministry of Labour\\u2019s manpower survey to place as many graduates as possible into jobs. How exactly this works is not clear. In the interest of transparency, the minister should disclose the policy that guides the process so as to assure job-seeking graduates that there is no political bias, nepotism or other forms of discrimination working against them. What the current job market challenges reveal, however, is the extent to which our youth have been failed by their governments\\u2019 lack of courage in tackling the fundamental challenge of transforming the economy and the education system. Minister Garcia, like others before him, is doomed to quick fixes because of the continued lack of in-depth analysis and planning by every government, the outcome being frustration for young job seekers and the country still short of some critical skills and competencies while having a surplus in some areas. Fortunately, many young people have not been waiting for the Government to pronounce on their prospects. The more proactive graduates are taking their future into their own hands. Many have gone abroad to be trained in the very fields that Minister Garcia and others have only been talking about. These are the people we need to grow the economy and expand our possibilities but who find limited space in which to manoeuvre in T&T. It is tough for graduates to come on the job market and find no job waiting for them, but they can be helped by job-placement programmes of the State, the business sector and the NGO community. T&T embassies within the Caribbean and further afield can also play a key role in identifying areas of opportunities for our nationals abroad and actively supporting them. Despite anti-immigrant sentiment in countries where T&T nationals have traditionally sought greener pastures, there are still opportunities to be found there as well in non-traditional job markets. None of this, however, relieves the Government of the responsibility of opening up new economic possibilities for our youth right here at home. Making the financial system more supportive of small entrepreneurs and pushing the market more firmly towards local content and export will create room for young people with ideas and products.

It sits behind the bush, out of sight of the nearest road, under the shade of a bamboo grove, on land that was once part of a sugar plantation. Here you will find a grave marker, leaning to the east, near a mound of scattered bricks, guarded by wasps, its inscription smothered by the soot and mould of countless rainy seasons and cane fires. It took a few minutes of scrubbing to read what is etched into the marble, several days to assemble the broken bits, and then some months to find out who lay in the ground beneath. The inscription on the tombstone at Dragon Hill, near Garth Road, Princes Town. The inscription reads: Esther Ness Stewart, the beloved wife of Henry Stewart, who died 21st December 1844 aged 30 years and 10 months. Also to their dear children Henry Robert Maxwell, who died 1st September 1842 aged one year and two months and Alexander who died 18th July 1844 aged 6 years and 7 months. This tablet is erected by a sorrowing husband and bereaved father 1845. This burial spot is a portal to a story tumbling back before the period of Indian Indentureship, before the evils of African enslavement, to the 1790s, when Spanish Trinidad was conquered by the British. How this young mother and her infants ended up living and dying in south Trinidad is a tale that begins in the Highlands of Scotland. The gravesite in located near this bamboo grove. Back then, the Highlands was part of the Her Majesty\\u2019s domain, but its subjects were considered uncultured and barbaric, with customs, laws, music and those kilts totally different from the other parts of Great Britain. From a Highland region known as Pertshire, David Stewart was born in the year 1772, in a 14th century castle called Garth. As a 17-year-old, he would join the regiment. And as a soldier under the leadership of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, Stewart sailed to the West Indies, in 1795, and fought in the Napoleonic Wars, helping to capture the then-French colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent. Stewart also did his part in the attempted genocide of the First Peoples, leading five companies of soldiers chasing after the Caribs of St Vincent (the extermination of that fierce, cruel and intractable race having become indispensable to the safely of the colonists, his obituary would record). In 1797, Stewart, then a Colonel, would be part of that British fleet that slipped in through the Dragon\\u2019s Mouth and took Trinidad from a capitulating Spanish Governor. Stewart would later sail to Gibraltar, be imprisoned for five months in Spain, and fight with Abercrombie in Egypt before being appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 3rd West India Rangers in Trinidad. He would become well acquainted with the island, and acquire the land at Savanna Grande, south of what is now Princes Town. Stewart would name the estate after his ancestral home in Scotland \\u2013 Garth. With David Stewart having returned to Scotland, and his brother John travelling to Trinidad to supervise the estate, the two managed the slave plantation into at least the late 1820s. We know this because the Stewart family left an extensive collection of letters and documents dating across centuries. The information was collated by descendant James Irving Robertson who wrote a book about clan titled \\u201cOut of Atholl\\u201d, and dedicate a chapter to the family\\u2019s travails in 19th century Trinidad. Robertson would also write a book titled: \\u201cThe First Highlander: Major General David Stewart of Garth\\u201d. Major General David Stewart To this day, David Stewart is idolised in Scotland for his military deeds (wounded twice in battle) and particularly for the book he authored: \\u201cSketches of the Character, Manners, and Present State of the Highlanders of Scotland\\u201d, still considered a definitive piece on the history of these proud people. But the island slave business of the Stewart brothers was far from respectable. According to the Stewart family records, the Garth sugar estate on Savanna Grande comprised 350 acres. By 1821, a modest plantation was in operation, 30 acres of land under sugarcane production, 239 acres of woodland worth 1,673 pounds, two mules and a horse, and 15 acres planted with provisions for the 31 slaves, whose value (worth between 20 and 150 pounds) , jobs and names were all meticulously documented like a stock list. Names have power so these are our ancestors : Jack the carpenter, John Houston - domestic and field, John Sharp \\u2013 Domestic and Field, Glasgow the cooper, John Brown \\u2013 Domestic and field, Bob the driver, Duncan the boiler, Neptune the fireman, Robert the carter, Joseph \\u2013 mule boy and field, Anne \\u2013 field, Moses, Daniel, Jackey, William, Charles, Charlotte, Fatima, Liddie, Mary Ann, Mary Lesie, Mary Melville, Jessie, Polly, Queen, Rosette Ker, Eve, Phebe, Fran, and Charlotte \\u2013 domestics, and Rosette the mule girl and field worker. All told, the estate and livestock - slaves and animals - were valued at 3,345 pounds. But it was never a profitable venture for the Stewarts, who were among the thousands of Scottish who sailed to the West Indies and became merchants, overseers, attorneys, planters, and slave-owners. The Stewart estate produced as much as 200 hogshead of sugar in a season. But it was always burdened by loans and debts, fluctuating prices, and the need for supplies shipped across the Atlantic, unfavourable weather, and its overseers dying of the \\u201cfever\\u201d and having to be replaced. Meanwhile, as a reward for his military achievements, General David Stewart would be appointed the first Lieutenant Governor of St Lucia. He arrived there in January 1829, but was dead of that \\u201cfever\\u201d within eleven months. His brother John died within a year on the Trinidad estate along with a nephew who had travelled to Trinidad to learn how to manage the slave plantation. Their dream of returning rich and retiring in luxury in Scotland died in the New World. None lived to see the abolition of slavery in 1834. Another Stewart family member would manage the plantation from Scotland but by 1840, the Garth Estate was a hopeless financial loss. And before mid-century, it had been sold off, leaving only that name. The land, of course, would continue to be worked for generations by the indentured Indians and their descendants. But no one interfered with that tomb left on Dragon Hill erected there by a man named Henry Stewart in memory of his deceased wife and infant children. Garth Road villager Ramesh Charan, who first led us to the tomb According to the family records, none of the Stewart brothers of Garth, Scotland sired any \\u201clegitimate\\u201d children\\u201d in Trinidad, but John Stewart did father at least three sons on the island. Whether Henry Stewart was a relation to the Stewarts of Garth is plausible but we could not determine for certain. Stewart, it turns out was the proprietor of the estate on the boundary of Garth. An account of a visit there by group of travelling American clergymen in 1840-41 is recorded thusly: \\u201cAt Williamsville, the estate of Henry Stewart, we met with a kind reception, The estate is one of the largest under cultivation in South Naparima, near four hundred are now in cane. As an eye ranged over his extensive fields, from our station upon the gallery of his mansion, it appeared as though an almost interminable amount of labour would be required to convert them into sugar\\u201d. But he too was cursed by ill luck in the rolling hills of south Trinidad, since his wife and children all likely died from yellow fever or malaria, which Europeans had little resistance against (also lurking was leprosy, tuberculosis, pneumonia, dysentery, the flu) . It was why so few women came to the Tropics, and why there were so many accepted white/coloured relationships. This Henry Stewart would turn up in records twice thereafter. He was at a meeting in San Fernando in August 1846 as the end of slavery and the beginning of the Indian Indentureship experiment convulsed the island and the sugar interests of the then one-percenters - planters, merchants, and proprietors. But two years later, he was giving a five star review of his 100 labourers, reporting: \\u201cThe Coolies are now superior to the Creoles in every kind of work. The Calcutta Coolies are excellent people\\u2026\\u201d. We could find no records of Henry Stewart\\u2019s death, obituary, or final resting place. So we returned to the Stewart family gravesite last week and began searching the bush and the bamboo. Not far from where the woman and children are buried, Dragon Hill gave up its second secret.

Police say they have arrested a 38-year-old man in connection with the robbery of three security officers who were at the time replenishing a Republic Bank Limited ATM, in the Caroni district on Monday. The suspect, a labourer of Trincity, was arrested by officers attached to the Cunupia and Chaguanas Criminal Investigations Departments (CID), around 11a.m. on Monday. The incident occurred around 12:10pm at the St. Helena Junction, when three armed G4S Secured Solutions Limited Estate Constables, who were restocking an ATM, were approached by three armed assailants who announced a robbery. The suspects then relieved the Constables of eight bins containing an undisclosed amount of cash and two loaded firearms from the victims, before escaping in a silver Nissan X-Trail motor vehicle. The vehicle was found abandoned at Centeno Road, El Carmen Village, St. Helena, without registration plates. CCTV footage showed the suspects switching into a white Hyundai Tucson motor vehicle and making their escape. Enquiries led to the 38-year-old suspect being arrested, after officers found the same white Tuscon parked in the driveway of the suspect\\u2019s Trincity home.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"A RETRIAL has been ordered in the case of a police officer who was charged with taking money for extra duties he did not perform. Court of Appeal judges Alice Yorke-Soo Hon and Mark Mohammed ordered the retrial in the matter of police officer Reeves Boodoo. Boodoo was charged with obtaining money by false pretences with intent to defraud back in December 2011. He was found guilty by a magistrate in June 2014 and fined $2,000 with a default sentence of four months hard labour. Boodoo who was represented by attorney Faraz Mohammed, filed an appeal on the grounds that he was not guilty, the magistrate erred in law in that the evidence could not support the conviction and that the decision was irrational. The State, represented by attorney Nigel Pilgrim, however contended that the magistrate erroneously placed Boodoo as a person of good character. It was also said that the case was a strong one, the witnesses were available and the offence was dated back to 2011. It was the State\\u2019s case that Boodoo falsely represented himself to an officer that he had performed extra duty at a bar in Mayaro and was entitled to the payment of $340. The officer believed him and gave him the money. It was later discovered that Boodoo did not do work the extra duty and that was not entitled to the cash. It was Boodoo\\u2019s case that he did not work the extra duty at the Mayaro bar. He said he did not go the station to collect money for such. He said when he went to the police station on December 3, 2011 he told the officer that he will be performing duties at Guayaguayare and asked if he could collect payment for this job. He said it was normal to request extra duty money before its performance. The judges said that despite issues in the prosecution\\u2019s case, the evidence was of sufficient quality to justify a retrial. It was also said the case was one of public interest given that Boodoo was a police officer. The conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered before another magistrate. Boodoo was placed on $50,000 bail pending the hearing of the matter.

The female suspect, a 30-year-old housewife was found by police holding a gift bag containing electronics which belonged to suicide victim Caroline Kassiram, who took her life on November 12. The two men - a 34-year-old labourer, and a 35-year-old football coach \\u2013 had removed the appliances from the house and placed them in the front yard. The three were held after police received a 1.20a.m. call on Thursday of a suspicious vehicle parked at Pluck Road, San Francique. Constables Bisnath and Nanan found a station wagon parked roadside. There was a crow bar on the front passenger seat. The doors were unlocked but no one was around. The police officers followed leads to a nearby house that they discovered had been broken into, and the appliances in the front yard. In the house, which belonged to Caroline Kassiram, were the three suspects. Two are from Golconda Village, San Fernando and the other is from Cipero Road, San Fernando.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"The kidnapping of Natalie Pollonais is a chilling development that further threatens the public\\u2019s already fragile sense of personal security, especially among the nation\\u2019s women. All the assumptions with which people live their daily lives are torn to shreds when a young mother going from gym to home in the middle of the day could be so easily snatched from her life. The national spirit shudders with the thought of how easily any of us or our loved ones could become the next victim. As in every case of kidnapping, this newspaper shares the fervent hope of the national community that Ms Pollonais would be returned safely to her family. This crime presents a major challenge to recently-appointed Commissioner Gary Griffith who would know that the first priority of the police in every kidnapping case is the safe return of the victim, whether or not a ransom demand is involved. Beyond that, the challenge is to ensure that this one case does not turn into the avalanche that engulfed T&T in 2007 when a record 155 kidnappings were recorded. Back then, sustained work by officers of the Anti-kidnapping Unit eventually brought the situation down to single-digits over the past decade with not a single case of kidnapping reported in 2016. Until recently, the assumed motive of kidnappers was the rapid handover of ransom payments. These days, women in particular have the additional worry about falling victim to human traffickers. The fear is fuelled by global reports and the mysterious disappearances of women such as hairstylist Ria Sookdeo who was abducted without a trace two years ago. Assurances by the Counter-Trafficking Unit that there have been no actual cases of women being trafficked from T&T have done little to quell public anxiety. Online conspiracy theorists are doing their part to fuel fear despite the CTU\\u2019s assertion following Sookdeo\\u2019s disappearance that the few cases recorded thus far have involved non-national victims who were brought into the country and forced into labour, notably in the porn trade. Even with that, however, the stark fact is that too many persons who have been reported as missing have not yet returned home or been found and too many police investigations into such reports are ending up in dead-ends. One can only imagine the living nightmare of their families. There are many crime detection resources that could improve the investigative capability of the Police Service. These include facilities to improve the response to crime reports including use of drones; integrated information networks drawing on data for fingerprints, DNA, sex offenders and others; dedicated resources for monitoring social media; CCTV camera network not limited to urban areas; strong community-based information networks that flow seamlessly upward; and ongoing training and recruitment to strengthen crime detection, among others. The new broom that Commissioner Griffith represents must be extended to embrace technological innovation in the fight against crime and the human challenge of building greater trust between the public and the police.

UWI Principal Brian Copeland explained that the MOU is to facilitate the development of programmes to help police officers to develop useful academic skills. \\u201cWhatever training is required to boost the level of service, bring it more up to date and also to give the participants some kind of direction to really contribute to development in the country,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe main thing for me is how they could impact on crime and that means sharpening their skills and sharpening the tools that they use to get to that point.

Not necessarily just have a degree but trained to that level...it is really and truly about building programmes that would have them do better beyond what it is that they do now.\\u201d Copeland said nothing has been finalized and the details are still being worked out. But he said univesrity training for police officers would assist in better police work on the ground and all must be done to address crime in Trinidad and Tobago. \\u201cWe will have a much more effective team in terms of discerning the crime and being able to respond to it, looking at strategies, looking at trends...where things are happening, using the technology to give information that would help to detect and hopefully to prosecute well.\\u201d Speaking briefly at the ceremony, Police Commissioner Gary Griffith said such training is critical to the success of the police service.

The Matelot Roman Catholic Church SO Matelot is back in the news, and villagers probably wish it wasn\\u2019t. Last Friday it was declared The Safest Village in Trinidad by acting Commissioner of Police Stephen Williams. Williams said only 20 serious crimes were reported in 2017. He did not mention that there were only about 900 people living in the village. The last time the rest of the country heard anything about this village was in 2017, when a night of rainfall sent a torrent of rock and mud down the north slope of the mountain range, washing out bridges, taking off some roofs, and flooding the houses closest the river mouth. Before that, it concerned the ruined fishing boats lashed against the rocks by some big waves. And before that, it was the awful road from Grande Riviere. For the town and city folk who visit the place, a trip to Matelot is like leaving the island. Many drive away asking - how did this place come to exist. Here's the explanation. Matelot is expecting big things from its political representative. Terry Rondon has been re-elected local government councillor for the area, and, after more than two decades on the job, is now chairman of the vast Sangre Grande Regional Corporation. Rondon's task is near insurmountable. But he has incentive. His family was among the early settlers of Matelot, benefited from its plantation prosperity, and witnessed its sad decay. Located as far from everywhere else as you can get in Trinidad, the village of less than 900 people has been in decline for as far back as anyone can remember. And as its economic importance and political relevance diminished, so have the resources needed for its development and upkeep. Headed to the river in Matelot The police post is often unmanned, with a single officer assigned a 24-hour shift. The ruined road leading to the village once called 'down in the hole', has discouraged the eco-tourists from making the trip in. The same problem has hampered agriculturists and fisher folk from getting their crop and catch to market. As a result, everyone loses. But there was a time when Matelot had economic might, important enough for the village to be a ferry port of call, and later, for a road to be carved out of the north coast cliff from Toco more than 25 kilometres away. There were so many people moving to the place back then that several settlements (no longer in existence) were born and thrived. And it was a village with enough souls to save too, for the Moravian Church, and the Anglican Church to send its missionaries, and for the Roman Catholics to erect a church in the what, today, seems the most unlikely of places. Dr Dane Morton-Gittesn, who authored the paper titled \\\"The Golden Age and Decline of Matelot, Trinidad (1885-1945)\\\". The rise and demise of Matelot was researched by Dr Dane Morton-Gittens who published his work in a paper titled The Golden Age and Decline of Matelot, Trinidad (1885-1945). In it, he cited the historical documents of the local Roman Catholic church, the colonial government, and several fellow historians, among his sources. Morton-Gittens, a teacher at the St Benedict's College, La Romaine, spent four years at the Matelot Community College and used the time to reach deep into the history of the place. He wrote that the first known inhabitants were the indigenous Carinepagoto, a Carib-speaking group, who in 1760, were herded to Toco by the Franciscan Capuchin Fathers (who had established a mission there), fearing raids from French and Dutch interlopers. Matelot became deserted, but in 1783, as a result of the Cedula of Population, two Spanish families, Estrada and Salvary, from Venezuela took up land in Matelot. The Matelot cemetery The two families would dominate for a century before 1890, when they were joined by the Rondon, Noriega and Sanchez families, also immigrants from Venezuela, as well as immigrants from the smaller islands. By 1933, there were over 605 people living in Matelot, and the cocoa industry had grown to such an extent that new cocoa areas had opened up in Petite Riviere, Lance Palmiste and Cachipa (all west of Matelot), with the Barious, Gransauls and Leong Chins also becoming big cocoa plantation owners. Matelot's prosperity began to wane in after 1920 when the cocoa price collapsed, and many farmers went bankrupt. So catastrophic was the decline that people in the villages of Petite Riviere, Lance Palmiste and Cachipa moved to Matelot. Morton-Gittens wrote that, in 1818, Governor Ralph Woodford introduced the \\u201cRound the Island\\u201d steamer to the village, which allowed the Spanish \\u201cPeons\\u201d to grow cocoa as a cash crop, which did so well, that in November 1885, Governor Sir William Robinson was allocated 200 pounds for the construction of a building to hold a police court and school. In September 1887, Fr Betrand Cothonay, on a visit to Matelot, noted that the village population was around 280 people, descended from the Estradas and Salvarys. This prosperity brought immigrants from Grenada, Barbados, St Vincent and Tobago, hoping to get labouring jobs in the cocoa industry and the start of 1889, Matelot was on the threshold of a new age. The bell tower of the Matelot Roman Catholic Church The Matelot Boys' and Girls' Roman Catholic School was completed in 1890, the same year that a bridle road was constructed from Toco, a route that remains a subject of complaint to this very day. It was around this time that a police service was introduced under pressure from planters victim to praedial larceny. A station and court building was opened in 1903, with the court (opened every 17th of March, June, September and December) dealing with primary cocoa related crimes. 1903 was also the year that a post office opened in the village with mail brought via steamer from Port of Spain. In 1907, a dispensary was set up with a doctor visiting once a week, dealing with cases of fevers, yaws, poisoning and worms. The Roman Catholic Church appointed Fr Hyacinth Bariou to the Toco/Matelot Parish in 1889, to minister in Matelot to villagers who found it difficult to travel to Toco to baptise children or organise burials, and to minister with couples \\u201cliving in sin\\u201d. A Google map view of Matelot Within three years, Bariou, the Church of the Immaculate Conception, capable of holding 200 people and complete with organ and choir, was complete, its upkeep coming from donations of crops to the Church. Morton-Gittens found that Bariou retired after being hurt in an accident on his way to Matelot, but continued to minister to the village, with his family donating land for the village cemetery, and embarking on a repair of the church bell tower. He would die before its completion (and given the title Apostle of the North Coast) and with that, Matelot reverted to the Parish of Toco (it remains to this day). Cocoa's collapse also took with it many of the social services after 1920, Morton-Gittens wrote. COMPLETE WITH ORGAN: The original Matelot Roman Catholic Church, built in 1890. This price crash (from $23.90 per 110 pounds to $9.50 in 1920) began the ruin for planters who experimented with growing nutmeg, tonka bean, coffee and citrus. However, as Morton-Gittens discovered, the hardest to be hit were the peasants, who began growing provisions, on land cleared illegally, or rented, or on which they were given permission to grow. And to supplement their income, some turned to fishing. But the area's economy never recovered, and cocoa farmers who had borrowed to buy cocoa land, lost everything. The labourers were retrenched, with malnutrition being reported because of the poor diet. Some got jobs with the Public Works Department (many still do today) while others became literal paupers, with Morton-Gittens finding that in 1939, 16 people from Matelot had received the poor allowance of 24 cents a month. But the Roman Catholic church stayed, with its school, opened in 1890 with an enrolment of 55 children, educating countless children over the years, including Rondon who, along with the Matelot Village Council, the Matelot King Fishers' Association, and the Dorcas Women's Group, now has a better chance at lifting Matelot out of the hole.

Image via Cana News, 20 July 2018. NEW YORK, July 20, CMC \\u2013 A jury in a New York court on Thursday found a 33-year-old man guilty of the death of Jamaican lawyer Carey Gabay, a former legal aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo during the Caribbean J\\u2019ouvert celebration on Labour Day 2015. Deceased: Jamaican lawyer. Image via Cana News, 20 July 2018. Though prosecutors had argued for a murder conviction, jurors in the Brooklyn Supreme Court instead reached a second-degree manslaughter conviction against Kenny Bazile. The Brooklyn, New York resident was also found guilty of criminal possessions of a weapon. Cuomo said Gabay, 43, the first deputy general counsel at a state economic development agency, \\u201cwas an inspiring public servant whose life was cut short by senseless gun violence. \\u201cI hope this guilty verdict gives them [Gabay\\u2019s family] some comfort that justice has been served,\\u201d he said in a statement. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez told Gabay\\u2019s family: \\u201cOur hearts go out to you. I know today\\u2019s verdict was difficult. \\u201cBut he was held responsible, and we\\u2019re going to make sure that the next set of defendants are also held accountable,\\u201d Gonzalez assured. Sam Karliner, Bazile\\u2019s lawyer said his client faces up to 15 years in jail on the involuntary manslaughter charge, when he is sentenced on September 12. He, however, said he will appeal Bazile\\u2019s conviction. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to say I disagree with it, but I think reckless endangerment would\\u2019ve been a better verdict,\\u201d Karliner told reporters after Thursday\\u2019s verdict. Bazile was the sixth man charged with the Gabay\\u2019s murder. \\u201cWe have made a promise to the family of Carey Gabay to hold accountable everyone who took part in the shootout that took his life,\\u201d said Gonzalez, who traces his roots to Puerto Rico. In June 2016, Micah Alleyne, 26, of Jamaica, Queens; Tyshawn Crawford, 22, of East New York, Brooklyn; and Keith Luncheon, 25, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn were indicted for murder and related charges for their alleged role in the shooting. A fourth defendant, Kenny Bazile, 32, was indicted on similar charges in September 2016, Gonzalez said. Stanley Elianor, 26, of Brownsville, Brooklyn, was also charged with second-degree murder, four counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and first-degree reckless endangerment in Gabay\\u2019s murder. Gonzalez said Elianor faces a maximum sentence of 40 years to life in prison if convicted of the top count with which he is charged. The defendant was previously arraigned in October 2015 with criminal possession of a weapon for allegedly having a loaded machine gun at the scene. Gonzalez said further investigation revealed that heallegedly also fired a small caliber gun, inciting additional violence, aswarring gang members engaged in a gun battle. He said that, according to the investigation, the incident took place during the early morning hours of September 7, 2015 in front of 1680Bedford Avenue, which is part of the Ebbets Field Houses in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At the time of the shooting, Gonzalez said the patio and street in front of the building were filled with hundreds of people, many of whom were celebrating J\\u2019ouvert, a traditional predawn festival that precedes the annual West Indian American Day Parade. Gonzalez said the building\\u2019s large patio was known to be controlled by the Folk Nation street gang, \\u201cwhich has been engaged in a year-long war with the 8-Trey faction of the Crips gang,\\u201d among others. At about 3:40 a.m., he said a group of 8-Trey members walked up from Montgomery Street, apparently heading toward the J\\u2019ouvert procession on Empire Boulevard, about two blocks to the south. \\u201cTheir presence in \\u2018enemy territory\\u2019 sparked a gun battle betweenFolk Nation members and their affiliates, who were shooting from the street and the patio, and the 8-Trey members who fired from the street before fleeing north,\\u201d Gonzalez said. \\u201cAn estimated two to three dozen shots were fired in two consecutive volleys from at least eight firearms, according to the investigation.\\u201d At the same time, Gonzalez said Gabay was walking north on Bedford Avenue with his brother and a couple of friends after attending the J\\u2019ouvert procession. \\u201cThey happened upon the front of the patio just as the gunfight broke out,\\u201d Gonzalez said. \\u201cThe group ran to a parking lot located between the patio and the street and ducked near parked cars. \\u201cA bullet struck Mr. Gabay in the head, and he was taken to Kings County Hospital Center [in Brooklyn], where he died a week later, on September 15, 2015,\\u201d Gonzalez said.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"token of thanks: AFFR representative Odette Campbell makes a presentation to University of Sussex vice-chancellor Adam Tickell after discussing concerns about tuition fees in British universities. token of thanks: AFFR representative Odette Campbell makes a presentation to University of Sussex vice-chancellor Adam Tickell after discussing concerns about tuition fees in British universities. The activist group Advocate for Fee Reform (AFFR) is calling on British universi\\u00adties to urgently consider reviewing tuition and other fees. The call comes as debate rages about the high cost of achieving academic qualifications and the resulting huge student loans. AFFR was recently formed to lobby for action on behalf of students and their families who are burdened by debt related to financing their education. \\u201cThis issue has been on the back burner for too long and needs to be brought front and centre of the debate,\\u201d said Advo\\u00adcate of Fee Reform activist Odette Campbell, during a recent discussion among students at Sussex University in the United Kingom. Campbell says she has heard complaints from British, Europe\\u00adan and international students who have voiced concerns about fees and she believes it is time for action. International students, inclu\\u00adding those from the Caribbean, are most impacted by the tui\\u00adtion fee structure. Whereas a post-graduate student from the UK pays \\u00a39,000 a year, Caribbean and other international students pay between \\u00a318,500 and \\u00a320,000. During a strike by the University and College Union (UCU) in February 2018, Campbell called attention to the issue by distri\\u00adbu\\u00ad\\u00adting pamphlets advocating for reform to government and UCU officials, students and other protesters. International students add value UCU regional representative Michael Moran supports the campaign and told Campbell: \\u201cWe have always taken the position that university education should be free at the entry point, so we agree with the abolition of all fees and the return of the living cost.\\u201d Asked about the concern that international students are of the view they are made to subsidise British students by paying double the quantum in tuition fees, Moran said: \\u201cI agree with you totally because international students and staff bring a different perspective to our institutions. So, I don\\u2019t see why they should have to pay in excess when their presence adds value.\\u201d President of the UCU Sussex branch Chris Chatwin also thinks it is time for a review: \\u201cI think that the UCU\\u2019s position is that they think the government should pay the fees. Obviously, that would be for UK students. For international students, that becomes more challenging, but I think that there are a lot of bursaries around that can help. Labour MP for Brighton Lloyd Russel-Moyle told Campbell in an exclusive interview that \\u201cLabour\\u2019s position is that fees should be abolished\\u201d. Student protester Lewis Back\\u00adon, who stood with lecturers on the picket line, also thinks fee reform should be put on the UCU agenda, telling AFFR: \\u201cFor too long, we have been complaining about the high fees, and I think that someone needs to come forward and help us with this dilemma.\\u201d Campbell recently took the opportunity to dis\\u00adcuss the concerns about the fees with vice-chancel\\u00adlor Adam Tickell when he embarked on the first in a series of one-on-one meetings with interested students. Campbell informed Tickell that many Caribbean students relish a chance to study at Sussex and other great universities in the UK, but were deterred by the exorbitant fees. Tickell said while he noted the concern, his hands are tied \\u201cbecause the fees are set by the government and not determined by the universities\\u201d. On February 19, British Prime Minister There\\u00adsa May announced a review into the funding of university courses. It will be led by the former city financier Philip Augur and could result in lower fees for some courses and the return of maintenance grants. In announcing the review, May said poorer students were \\u201cbearing the highest levels of debt\\u201d in the current system, which she said was not good enough. \\u201cWe must have an education system at all levels which serves the needs of every child. And if we consider the experience which many young people have of our system as it is, is clear that we do not have such a system today,\\u201d she said.

A DELIVERY driver who experienced crime on three occasions was yesterday jailed for three years for possession of a loaded gun. Adesh Adhar said he had the gun and ammunition for his protection but the magistrate said she heard no strong reasons for a jail term not to be imposed. Adhar, 28, of Pleasantville, faced San Fernando Senior Magistrate Cherril-Anne Antoine charged with possession of a 9mm pistol and ten rounds of ammunition. Police prosecutor Cleyon Seedan said it was at 5.40 p.m. on Saturday that officers who, as part of their exercise duties, went to a bar at Cipero Road, San Fernando where they saw the defendant. He was sitting on a bar stool at the counter of the bar and looked in the police\\u2019s direction, got up and quickly walked away. Constable Narine and other officers approached him and the loaded gun was found hidden in the right side of his pants waist. He told the officers: \\u201cBoss, I have that for my protection.\\u201d Adhar was taken to Mon Repos police station where Narine charged him. Defence attorney Dane Halls said his client, who celebrated his birthday last Friday, was remorseful for his actions. He told the court Adhar had no previous convictions and this was confirmed by police prosecutor Seedan. Halls said that three years ago, Adhar witnessed three of his family members, including his mother and sister, robbed at gunpoint of their vehicle. They were parked outside their Pleasantville home. Halls said that on another occasion Adhar was shot in the right forearm during a robbery. In the third incident, the attorney said, the delivery driver\\u2019s life was threatened. He said his client was misled that he could get a firearm \\u201cto stave off criminal activity from himself\\u201d. However, Seedan countered that the gun and ammunition were illegal and such purchases add to the trade of illegal arms and ammunition. The prosecutor also asked the court to consider that Adhar was found with the gun at a bar where alcohol is consumed and situations could arise. The magistrate said while Adhar had no previous convictions, she noted the seriousness of the charges. She also said Adhar was not working but was casually having drinks at a bar and he took the gun with him. Antoine told Halls she had not heard \\u201creally strong reasons\\u201d for a custodial sentence not to be imposed. She sentenced Adhar to three years\\u2019 hard labour for possession of the firearm and nine months for possession of the ammunition.

The restored artistic ceiling of the Red House in Port of Spain which is currently being restored. Make up your mind on whether you want Venezuelans to be given refugee status in Trinidad and Tobago or not. This is what Acting Prime Minister Colm Imbert told the Opposition yesterday as he responded to a question from Couva South, Rudy Indarsingh on whether there were Venezuelans migrants employed on the Red House project. Imbert said UDeCOTT was currently conducting an investigation by making inquiries of all contractors and sub-contractors on the project. He said until that investigation was completed and the information received, he could not provide an answer to Indarsingh\\u2019s question. However Imbert said the Opposition couldn\\u2019t have it both ways. \\u201cWhen 82 Venezuelans were repatriated recently there was a hue and cry and a hullabaloo coming from the other side about the actions of the Government and they demanded that we give Venezuelans refugee status. Members opposite have to make up their minds because if you are going to give Venezuelans refugee status, then you have to allow them to work as part of the refugee process,\\u201d he said. Asked by St Augustine MP Prakesh Ramadhar whether Government was now moving to a policy of accommodating Venezuelan refugees by employing them through the State, Imbert said his (Imbert\\u2019s) point was that if Opposition members wanted Government to accept Venezuelans as refugees then they had to be allowed to work and therefore the Opposition had to make up its mind whether refugee status should be granted wholesale or not to Venezuelans. Asked whether the labour laws and the Occupational health and safety laws were being observed with respect to the use of protective gear for employees on the Red House site, Imbert said the UDeCOTT will make a comprehensive report on all aspects of the project. In response to another question, Imbert said the Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley had not received a response from the UN to his complaint about their local UN representative commenting on the repatriation of the 82 Venezuelans. He said the person \\u201cin question\\u201d (local UN representative) \\u201cis leaving\\u201d. Tabaquite MP Suruj Rambachan said: \\u201cHe already left\\u201d.

TWO men will spend just over ten more years in prison custody after they both admitted to shooting a dentist to death during an attempted robbery at his office in 2007. The two have already spent close to 11years in custody awaiting trial for the capital offence which took occurred at Madras Road, St James, on the afternoon of May 22, 2007. But before the matter could proceed to trial before Justice Hayden St Clair-Douglas, the duo of Dwayne Hamilton and Daniel Robinson, opted to plead guilty to the crime under the felony murder rule, a decision which in turn credited them with an automatic one-third discount on the total time to be served in jail. They were both charged with the murder of Dr Russel John, who was shot three times in full view of his wife and infant children and died two days later at hospital. Before passing sentence at the Hall of Justice in Port of Spain yesterday, the judge recapped how the two carried out the crime. The judge said on the day in question, both men entered the office, while pretending to be patients. After being taken to the reception area, Hamilton pulled out a firearm and announced a robbery. But John resisted and was shot three times including once to the neck. The dentist also managed to withdraw a firearm of his own and shot Hamilton once before both men escaped. John was taken to hospital and while there, his receptionist noticed another man being brought to the health institution for treatment for a gunshot wound. She later recognized him as Hamilton. After the bullet was removed from his body, tests were carried out which revealed that the projectile was the one fired by the dentist. He was charged with the crime upon being discharged. In August 2007, Robinson was also taken into custody and charged with the murder. In passing sentence, Justice St Clair-Douglas said the crime was a brazen one that took place a location where one would have considered themselves to be safe. \\u201cThis was not in a restaurant where someone was sitting down to eat, this was not at a bar where people are drinking, this was not along a dark street or any other location where someone might expect such a situation to occur. This was at his office where he should be free to carry out their practice,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a place where people went to get help,\\u201d he added. Justice St Clair-Douglas said what made the crime even more aggravating was the fact that John\\u2019s wife and infant children could do nothing but just stand there and do nothing while he bled from the neck, dying. In considering all of the factors, the judge said he found the appropriate starting point for sentence to be that of 33 years\\u2019 hard labour. But with the guilty pleas, an automatic 11 years had to be deducted, leaving a term of imprisonment of 22 years. In addition to that, the time already served in prison also had to be withdrawn. Based on the calculation, Hamilton will serve ten years and six months before being released, while Robinson will serve ten years and two months. The men were represented by attorneys Daniel Khan, Ravi Rajah and Darryl Worrell.

A POLICE prosecutor on Wednesday argued for a jail term to be imposed on a pipe fitter who said he had a loaded gun at a bar because he was the victim of two robberies over a two month period. Police prosecutor Ramdath Phillip said on Tuesday that if it were true that Shorn Alexander had been robbed in the past, he should not have been at the bar at 4.15 a.m. Alexander, 25 or Princes Town, pleaded guilty to the offences of possession of a firearm and six rounds of ammunition before San Fernando Second Court magistrate Natalie Diop. The charges were laid by constable Dookhie. The court heard that at 4.15 a.m. on Sunday, Alexander was found with a loaded gun in his waist while at a bar in Ste Madeleine. Defence attorney Kevin Ratiram said his client was the victim of two robberies over the last two months and foolishly went and obtained the gun. He petitioned the court to fine the Alexander, the father of a six-month-old child. But police prosecutor Ramdath Phillip said that Alexander stated he was the victim of two robberies but was found with the gun at 4.15 a.m. at a bar. \\u201cIf he was claiming he was the victim of robberies, that is a place he should not have been,\\u201d Phillip said. He asked Diop to consider that Alexander had a 2014 conviction for possession of marijuana and also to consider the current crime situation in the country with respect to illegal firearms. He called for Alexander to serve a jail term for the offences. In passing sentence, Diop said she took the crime climate into consideration. She also said that the appropriate response was not for Alexander to arm himself with an unlicensed weapon. She started with a sentence of nine months for possession of the gun and deducted one third for Alexander\\u2019s guilty plea. He was sentenced to six months hard labour for this offence. For having the ammunition, he was sentenced to two months hard labour. Diop had made a one third discount from the starting sentence of three months. The sentences are to run concurrently therefore Alexander will serve six months in prison.

Tabaquite member of Parliamant Suruj Rambachan is asking Local Government Minister Kazim Hosein how the Ministry could spend $12 million in wages and salaries for public health in Port of Spain when rats are still running along Charlotte Street. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday during the Standing Committee on Finance Rambachan said it was a \\u201cdiscrepancy\\u201d to have large sums for wages and salaries and the relatively small sums for materials for public health and disposal for the Port of Spain Corporation under the 2019 Budget. Rambachan said he was very concerned about the health of the people of this country because people had died of leptospirosis. \\u201cPeople have died in this country from rat disease,\\u201d he said. Rambachan said: \\u201cHow could you have a budget of $350,000 for material while $12 million is allocated to wages and salaries. You have so many people involved, you have so much money in wages and salaries and so little material for them to do the job,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo you have rat-infested communities and all kinds of things and you paying a lot of wages\\u201d. He added that in addition to the $12 million for wages, there was an additional $1.6 million for short term employment. \\u201c Vending on Charlotte Street What are all these people doing? Are they working or are they working for two hours and then going home because they have no materials ?\\u201d the Tabaquite MP asked. \\u201cWell they not supposed to work (for) two hours and then go home,\\u201d Hosein said. He said if more funds were needed there would be a virement (movement of funds from another head of expenditure to this item). Rambachan raised the same point with respect to the improvement and maintenance of cemeteries in Port of Spain area. Noting that $5.9 million was allocated for wages for persons to maintain cemeteries and $140,000 for materials and supplies, Rambachan asked: \\u201cwhy is it that so many of the cemeteries with all that labour still have all this overgrown grass?\\u201d He said when he was Mayor of Chaguanas the Corporation purchased wackers and cemeteries were cut every week, not every four months. \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t that be done in all the cemeteries in Trinidad and Tobago?\\u201d he asked, adding that \\u201cyour departed ones..your ancestors\\u201d, should be treated properly. Shoppers on Charlotte Street, Port of Spain recently. The Tabaquite MP also asked whether the garbage contract contain clauses that deal with the provision of clothing and other materials required by garbage collectors to protect their health. Told by Hosein that the contractor is supposed to provide all the materials, Rambachan said: \\u201cIs the Minister aware that there are people working on these garbage trucks without gloves, without masks and on many occasions wearing rubber slippers (on the their feet) ?\\u201d. \\u201c Yuh want the evidence?\\u201d Rambachan added, as the Finance asked him in what Corporation had he seen this. Rambachan said it was happening in corporations all across the country, but pressed by Imbert, he said he saw in in Tunapuna/Piarco, in the St Augustine area. Robinson Regis said Government wanted some evidence because \\u201csometimes people make broad sweeping generalisations. If we can get the evidence as it relates to contractors in Tunapuna we will be able to investigate and the Minister and the Ministry will be able to deal with that,\\u201d she said.

Other officials include, from left Minister of Trade and Industry, Paula Gopee-Scoon, Professor Kenneth Julien, chairman of Alutech and Minister of Energy and Energy Affairs. Photo: STEPHEN DOOBAY Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley has criticised the People\\u2019s Partnership administration for \\u201cfoolishly\\u201d shutting down the aluminium industry in 2010 when it came into office in 2010 and \\u201cmisleading\\u201d the public about the proposed aluminium smelter in La Brea. The prime minister was speaking at the relaunch of the Alutech project with the construction of a manufacturing facility at the Tamana Intech Park, Wallerfield. Rowley said had the shutdown not occurred, this country would have been exporting aluminium products of the highest quality and the economy would have been diversified. \\u201cAnd when the oil price collapsed to US$28 (per barrel) we would have been earning in the aluminium industry because that was a different industry, and we would have been diversifying our economy. We did that to ourselves and we didn\\u2019t do it for free,\\u201d he said. \\u2018We did it at a tremendous cost\\u2026.because we shut the smelter down in La Brea, creating persistent poverty down there. We exposed ourselves to hundreds of millions of dollars in claims down there,\\u201d he said. Rowley said millions of dollars was also paid to the Trinidad Generation Unlimited for power that could not be used. He said, in addition, millions of dollars went to waste as construction of the Alutech facility, which would manufacture aluminium wheel rims, stopped following the shutdown of the smelter. Energy Minister Franklin Khan noted that at the time Alutech had spent US$19 million in plant and machinery, which was left to rot. The scrapped aluminium smelter was supposed to supply the Alutech Facility with feedstock, in the form of liquid metal, to manufacture various downstream aluminium products, including car rims. \\u201cThat is the gift of those who start off their conversation by saying I don\\u2019t know but I can tell you all about it,\\u201d Rowley said of the shutdown of the smelter. \\u201cLet me make it quite clear that we are not restarting the aluminium smelter plant. We lost that. We are going back to the aluminium business but based on obtaining raw material, not from a smelter in La Brea, but from the international marketplace,\\u201d Rowley said at the launch, held inside the Tamana Intech Park. He likened the process of manufacturing aluminium rims to the production tomato ketchup- raw materials are imported and, using local inputs like labour and electricity, the final product will be packaged and sold. \\u201cIn 18 months\\u2019 time Trinidad and Tobago will join purchasers who buy raw aluminium ingot, bring it to our factory here in T&T and start our manufacturing to supply an area of growth and demand by making aluminium car wheels for the transport industry, mainly for markets in Central and South America.

He explained that Koojan and the victim were drinking alcohol when the incident occurred and while his client does not have an alcohol problem he \\u201cfell prey to its effects and loss his head.\\u201d Lucky said, \\u201cThey were socializing with drinks and things just got out of hand and a fight started. The victim and the defendant knew each other for over ten years.

Police prosecutor Cleyon Seedan told the court that at 8 a.m. on October 21, at Koojan\\u2019s Debe home there was argument and Deoraj Doobre was chopped to the back of his head with a cutlass. As the altercation continued, Koojan escaped. He was met at the police station where Doobre identified him as the person who caused his injury. Koojan told the police, \\u201cBoss, me and he fight, so I chop him.\\u201d Doobre was treated at hospital and discharged the following day. Koojan, a construction worker, was charged by constable James. Defence attorney Ainsley Lucky said he was not downplaying the seriousness of the charge but he described Doobre\\u2019s injuries as minimal. He asked that his client be spared a jail term. The magistrate said he could have faced a capital charge. Antoine said his criminal record showed he had two previous convictions in the last ten years. She told Koojan she as not satisfied with his behaviour. \\u201cAt 8 a.m. they can\\u2019t conduct themselves and one had to chop the other one.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"A story in yesterday\\u2019s Express involving a 35-year-old man from Otaheite who stole a bunch of green bananas from a judge\\u2019s backyard connects forcefully with the letter to the editor by the current president of the Trinidad and Tobago Association of Psychologists. In a plaintive argument, Dr Margaret Nakhid-Chatoor has asked the country to consider the extent to which successive governments have paid any real attention to the needs of those members of society labouring under the weight of mental illnesses. Responding to the pronouncements delivered this past Monday by the Finance Minister, Dr Nakhid-Chatoor lamented that \\u201cnot a five cents\\u201d provision was made to address this huge and growing problem in our midst. Whatever pro-forma nod was given in the direction of the social services, she derided it as having been provided for \\u201cbuilding up of infrastructure for hospitals and schools, and nothing else.\\u201d Nothing, she said, was provided to address what she described as a society increasingly tilting towards national trauma. This is illustrated by observations about increasing cases of suicide and \\u201csuicide-ideation,\\u201d domestic violence, downsizing and retrenchment, and bullying in schools. There is, she laments, an official inability \\u201cto lean on the statistics of a nation\\u201d, in these and other regards. The case of the man in Otaheite, and the decision of the magistrate in the court in Siparia speak loudly, however, to a recognition that official reaction to such phenomena must change. At 35 years old, this man is reported to have had 20 previous convictions, among them cases of drug possession, house-breaking and larceny. He pleaded guilty on the latest offence, and Magistrate Margaret Alert ordered him to pursue rehabilitation. Failure to do this will result in jail time. This, clearly, is a case of someone among so many hundreds of young and relatively young persons in the society in need of the kinds of interventions to which Dr Nakhid-Chatoor refers. Another term in prison is not likely to yield any of the benefits which persons such as this offender desperately need as a means of beginning to turn their lives around. His excuse in this instance was that he needed something to cook. But what the information on his rap sheet would have illustrated was that of a habitual offender, someone who needs professional help to lick an addiction that manifests itself in his constant journeys through the courts. In this case as in so many others, the possession of illegal substances, cocaine in this instance, is merely another symptom of a much deeper malady. Sizing up the situation as it was presented before her, magistrate Alert must be applauded for seeing the forest and not just the trees. The exercise of her discretion in sentencing must be seen for what it is, an attempt at social re-engineering, in a critical area of the country\\u2019s justice system. And where it meets with the kinds of interventions, the recognition for the urgency of which Dr Nakhid-Chatoor has called for, once again, is where we must be headed.

My son, Ro\\u00adbert, who was younger, died at age 37 some years ago.\\u201d How often does a woman fill the role of a single mother twice in one lifetime? Phyllis Weekes was 12 when she lost her father, followed by her mother at age 14.

On leaving Bishop Anstey High School, she joined the Public Service and was attached to the Government Chemist on Frederick Street, Port of Spain. However, on the start-up of the Pay As You Earn System (PAYE) in the country, Weekes was transferred to the Inland Revenue Department where she worked until retirement. Living at home The pre\\u00adsident-elect, still lives with her mother in Petit Valley. As a child, the family lived in Baden Powell Street, Woodbrook, and Madam Justice Weekes first attended Miss Ritchie\\u2019s Private School on Phillip Street, followed by Tranquillity Gov\\u00adern\\u00adment Primary School where she passed the Common Entrance exam\\u00ad\\u00adination under Rudolph Gordon\\u2019s tutelage for Bishop Anstey High School. At the end of Sixth Form, she went to The University of the West Indies at Cave Hill, Barbados, to study law. \\u201cWe will continue to share residences,\\u201d says Phyllis Weekes, \\u201cbecause I understand my daughter. If I did not, it would have been a challenge, but I have always understood her. \\u201cThere was never any trouble with Paula in school. She would do her homework while waiting for me to collect her after school.

Kadeem Charles, 19 of La Romaine faced San Fernando senior magistrate Cherril-Anne Antoine. He was not called upon to plea to the indictable charges. It was alleged that on September 25 at Church Street, La Romaine, he, together with another person armed with a gun, robbed Jessie Ramkaran of $12,000 and two cellular phones together valued $3,700. It was also alleged that on September 29, with the other person and with a gun, robbed Jaimie Forde of $1,000 and Radesh Gunness of his $175 wallet with a $500 driver's permit, identification and bank cards both valued $50 and $700 cash. In each instance personal violence was allegedly used toward the victims. Charges were laid by officers Surujbally and Charles. Defence attorney Frank Gittens said his client lived with his parents and had no previous convictions or pending matters before the court. He asked that Charles's mother be able to sign bail on his behalf. Antoine however disagreed. She said there were three charges and three alleged victims. Police prosecutor Cleyon Seedan made no objection to bail but asked that conditions be attached, including no contact with the alleged victims via social media. Antoine placed Charles on $300,000 bail requiring clerk of the peace approval and a cash alternative bail of $30,000. As a condition of bail, Charles is to have no contact by any means with the three he allegedly robbed. He is also to report to the San Fernando police station once a week and surrender his passport.

Cassandra Baiju hold her three-year-old son Verendra Roopchan, who has been having nightmares after his family were affected by the recent flood at the Penal home. TRAUMATIZED by the recent flooding to his home, little three-year-old Verendra Roopchan spends sleepless nights, afraid that, \\u201cthe sharks will come.\\u201d Mother Cassandra Baiju, of Suchit Trace recalled how her children were left terrified from the rising flood waters they witnessed entering their home. Last week\\u2019s flooding left several communities in south under water. Many in Suchit Trace were marooned in their homes in the rising waters for days as little help came. Baiju said this was the worse flood she has experienced, following last year\\u2019s flooding. However, the mother of two worries of about her children\\u2019s mental health as they awoke on Thursday morning to witness their parents rushing to safeguard their property. \\u201cThis is very traumatizing for all of us, especially the children. My little one (Verendra) woke up to see the water coming inside the house. We put them (the brothers) on the bed while we tried to raise everything higher, but the water came in more than we expected. We weren\\u2019t as prepared as we thought we were. And at night, he (Verendra) would say that sharks would come for him. Up to now, he can\\u2019t sleep and when he does it\\u2019s for a few minutes. We have to keep telling him it\\u2019s okay and that nothing will happen to him but he is scared,\\u201d said Baiju. Baiju is an oyster vendor and her husband works as a part-time labourer with the Ministry of Agriculture. She said they have little money to refurnish her home and is currently paying loans for her household items, which are now damaged from the floods. Baiju said criticised officials for its lack of response even while she was stranded in her home. \\u201cWhen I called them about a shelter, they said yes there was one in Penal. Then they came for us, but that shelter was in Mendez. We couldn\\u2019t leave everything here to go there. The lied to us, they was giving us wrong information. I was listening to the news about where there was shelters ,\\u201d she said. The Penal/Quinam Government Primary School was one of the shelters identified and is located in Mendez Village, some 15 kilometres away from her home. Baiju said she was thankful to neighbours who housed her and her family during the three days of flood. She added that no officials has visited her home to conduct any assessment and it is through the kindness shown by her neighbours and friends who have supported her during this ordeal. Baiju said her car has also been damaged by the flood and cannot go to the grocery to purchase more cleaning supplies. \\u201cI have no pressure washer to use so I am scrubbing everything own by hand and right now by hands are blistered. We lost everything we have and have been working hard all these years to purchase things. My car is damaged and I have no transport to get more things. now that the water has gone down we are sleeping on the floor. I had already decorated for the Christmas and all that is gone. This will be a terrible Christmas for us. Every time it looks like it is about to rain I get worried and frightened,\\u201d she said. Baiju was not the only one who expressed similar sentiments. Ajodha Dhanraj, 52, a labourer said he lost everything to the floods and no one has since come to assist him and his family. Lalman Rambharose of Suchit Trace said officials from the regional corporation\\u2019s Disaster Management Unit has visited his home and was also visited by people from the MP\\u2019s office. However, Rambharose\\u2019s concern was the box drain located next his home and the incomplete highway segment located some 1,500 metres to the back his home. He said the drain is not cleaned on a regular basis and takes the responsibility of cleaning it himself. He said: \\u201cwhen it is clogged it affects me because the village flood water coming through it and where it ends is next to by place. That needs to be about 60 feet longer so that water doesn\\u2019t come over to my place. And this is something the regional corporation knows because I wrote a letter to them about it and called them. The next thing is the highway. Since they started with that highway we getting floods and it worsen each time. Nothing is being done, so there is no proper drainage system and that water backs-up and affects me. Something has to be done seriously about this. I have to have a strong mind right now because all I doing is just going forward because I have to get my family back to our home.\\u201d Rambharose said following last year\\u2019s flooding, he temporarily constructed a wooden house for his family and had already purchased new building materials for a concrete structure to be built next year. However, given this recent flooding, his plans to rebuild may be delayed as he now has to find money to purchase his lost household items. He said his family is staying with neighbours until they have completed he cleaning of his house.

The labour movement began day two of the \\u201cMother of all Marches\\u201d at daybreak on Thursday. Oilfield Workers Trade Union (OWTU) president general, Ancel Roget, walked ahead of hundreds of workers who gathered at Rienzi Complex, Couva. He was joined by All Trinidad Sugar and General Workers Trade Union (ATS&GTU) president, Nirvan Maharaj, Sheep and Goat Farmers Association, Shiraz Khan, and members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU). The workers began the second leg of the march at around 6.30am, towards the Aranguez Savannah. The trade union leaders spent Wednesday night on mattresses at Rienzi Complex. Roget said the leaders would also overnight at the Aranguez Savannah. The three-day march began at Pointe-a-Pierre roundabout, outside Petrotrin\\u2019s refinery on Wednesday. Roget said the march was being held to education citizens along the way on Government\\u2019s move to shut down the oil industry.

Roget said the Government\\u2019s move to shut down the Petrotrin refinery was a direct attempt to destroy the OWTU and the labour movement. Petrotrin workers make up the core of the OWTU membership. On Friday, Roget would lead the march into Port-of-Spain. The Petrotrin Board announced last week that the refinery would cease operations on November 30. All permanent workers would be sent home.

FOUR years after relatives told police Esther Williams\\u2019 died as a result of suicide, her common law husband and daughter have been charged with killing her. Seewak Jagroo, 58, a labourer of Little Caura Road, Cumuto, and daughter Shastri Jagroo, 25, of McBean, Couva, were on Tuesday charged with Williams\\u2019 murder. Detectives of the Cold Case Unit headed by Ag ASP Sean Dhillpaul and including Sgt Sean Williams and Cpl Shawn Gordon of the Cumuto Police Station investigated. Cpl Gordon laid the charges following advice received from Director of Public Prosecutions, Roger Gaspard, SC. This is the eleventh murder case solved by the Cold Case Unit since it was established in 2017. The father and daughter were due to appear before the Sangre Grande Magistrates\\u2019 Court on Wednesday. Williams died on April 18, 2014. Both father and daughter allegedly reported to the Cumuto Police Station on the day of the incident, that the 54-year-old housewife, had died by suicide after they allegedly discovered her body hanging at their home. Subsequent investigations and post-mortem results revealed that the victim died of ligature strangulation. The body also bore multiple blunt traumatic injuries which were inconsistent with the suicide claim.

AN EMPLOYEE who was charged with stealing a part of a computer from the San Fernando General Hospital was successful in her appeal before the court recently. Raffeeza Soodoo-Mohammed, 41 of Princes Town, appealed the magistrate\\u2019s decision, at the end of the trial in 2017, to fine her $10,000 or have her serve two years hard labour in default of paying the money. It was alleged that on July 19 2015, she stole a central processing unit (CPU) valued $5,900, the property of the South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA). She was charged with the offence of larceny the same day the item was allegedly stolen from the hospital. Her appeal was heard before the Justices Mark Mohammed and Alice York Soo-Hon at the San Fernando High Court. Soodoo-Mohammed who was then a hospital attendant attached to the hospital, was represented by attorney Sean Cazabon. The grounds he presented for the appeal included that the prosecution failed to prove that the CPU was owned by the SWRHA, there was failure by the lawyer who represented Mohammed at the trial to lead evidence of her good character and failure by the magistrate to provide reasons in support of her decision to fine Soodoo-Mohammed. The appeal judges overturned the conviction and the sentence was reversed. Soodoo-Mohammed told the Express that she is awaiting a letter from the Service Commission Department to reinstate her to her permanent position at the hospital. The mother of two said she worked for eight years at the Port of Spain and five San Fernando General Hospital before the allegation was made. She said she had problems coping with the stress from the situation. Soodoo-Mohammed said after three years away from the hospital, she is eager to begin working once more. \\u201cI am happy I won the case. I had an excellent lawyer.

The constables were members of the Southern Division Task Force when Gilbert was killed in October 2016. Following an investigation into Gilbert\\u2019s death, they were reassigned to other units within the police service. They were taken into custody by their colleagues of the Homicide Division Region III. Gilbert, 37, of San Fernando, was at work at a construction site of the Housing Division Complex at Lawrence Street, San Fernando when he was shot and killed. Police claimed that Gilbert, who was allegedly wanted for crimes including murder, cocaine trafficking and escaping custody, had a firearm and shot at police officers. Residents claimed that Gilbert was inquiring about a surveillance drone to a plain clothes police office when he got into an argument. As the argument escalated, Gilbert ran and was shot in the chest by police officers.

The convict, Neil Singh, had been living in the Nissan AD Wagon. His mother said that Singh, who celebrated his 36th birthday on Tuesday, had been put out the house because of his drug addiction. Singh appeared before San Fernando magistrate Alicia Chankar charged with malicious damage to the car to the value of $40,000. Police prosecutor Cleyon Seedan told the court that at 4 p.m. on July 29 the victim was at her Rambert Village, San Fernando home when she saw Singh standing close to the car which was parked on the roadway in front the house. She saw him light an item and toss it through the back door of the car. She then saw smoke coming from the car and saw Singh running away. The victim checked and saw piece of cloth on fire in the back seat of the car. The blaze spread throughout the vehicle which burnt.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"SEXUAL harassment in the workplace may appear to be the latest hot button topic but it is in fact a long-standing evil that has been allowed to continue without the necessary rules to prevent it, or hard and fast means to take action against the perpetrators. So we should say \\u201cbetter late than never\\u201d with the introduction this week of the Equal Opportunity Commission\\u2019s Guidelines on Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, which was launched in commemoration of International Women\\u2019s Day on Thursday. With the courts and police seemingly unable to get a handle on domestic violence\\u2014with women continuing to run scared and often suffering the ultimate fate at the hands of abusive partners\\u2014it is hoped that these guidelines will be able to protect those who find themselves victims of harassment at their place of employment. At Tuesday\\u2019s launch, Labour Minister Jennifer Baptiste-Primus implored employers and employees to speak out and educate people on the harm and cost of sexual harassment in the workplace. And she admitted that while it is a real and widespread issue, it was also a broad and ambiguous subject. Pointing out that employees and employers did not completely understand what constitutes sexual harassment or who can be charged with a violation, the minister said the guidelines were timely, given the number of allegations which took centre stage in recent times, \\u201cat an alarming rate\\u201d, both locally and internationally. \\u201cWhile some measures have been developed to address the issue of discrimination in the workplace, this offence is reinforced by the absence of policies and procedures and specific laws at the national level to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace in Trinidad and Tobago,\\u201d said Ms Baptiste-Primus in her address. \\u201cIt is acknowledged as a serious issue, a complex challenge, one that is often controversial and contentious and is still distasteful,\\u201d she added, stating that the guidelines propose \\u201cto treat with the right not to be sexually harassed, as well as the procedure for settling sexual harassment complaints.\\u201d The Equal Opportunity Commission should be lauded for introducing these guidelines, which we trust will be rigorously enforced. For as EOC vice-chairman Dr Beverly Beckles said: \\u201cWhile it appears that the message of intolerance and unacceptability concerning sexual harassment is certainly being heard in some workplaces in Trinidad and Tobago, this is woefully inadequate as the majority of workplaces do not have a workplace policy on sexual harassment. \\u201cThis is a message that employers need to play a crucial role in promoting if it is to gain further acceptance,\\u201d she added. With regard to legislation, EOC chairman Lynette Seebaran-Suite stressed that it should also guard against victimisation and should make the employer liable for not taking reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment although being informed about it. With this first crucial step in putting a stop to sexual harassment, it is now up to the lawmakers to follow through and ensure that this scourge is eradicated once and for all.

Kevin Ramroop (left) and Jonathan Ramcharan leave the San Fernando High Court on Thursday afternoon. TWO men who faked their kidnappings were on Thursday sentenced to 30 days in prison. Jonathan Ramcharan, 24 of Gasparillo, sent a message to his mother for a $100,000 ransom after he found himself in financial difficulty. He admitted he also scraped part of his body \\u201cto make his story seem real.\\u201d Kevin Ramroop, 22 of Tarouba, thought his kidnapping for ransom would lead to him rekindling with his ex-girlfriend. He asked that $60,000 be handed over for his safe return. Both men who were charged with wasteful employment of the police, had sent messages to relatives on Wednesday. Police prosecutor Sgt Krishna Bedassie told the court that at 11.14 a.m. on Wednesday Ramcharan\\u2019s mother Asha Lessey Ramcharan was at their Gasparillo home when she received a text message from her son\\u2019s phone that he had been kidnapped. A second message made a ransom demand of $100,000. She made a report to the police. Several officers went to different locations, including Carlton Centre, San Fernando where they viewed camera footage. When officers met Ramcharan the following day, he told them he had not been kidnapped. \\u201cI left Carlton Centre and took a black taxi to Port of Spain. When I sent the message to my mother, I was a passenger in a taxi. I had some money problems so I could explain why I did it.\\u201d When asked about his minor injuries, he said, \\u201cI wanted to make my story seem real so I scraped myself up with keys from my mother\\u2019s car.\\u201d He said he threw these and the cell phone away in Port of Spain but was unsure of the exact location as \\u201cI don\\u2019t know town.\\u201d Ramcharan was charged by constable Gervais. KIDNAP victim Jonathan Ramcharan was found in Maraval on Wednesday night. Defence attorney Subhas Panday said the father of one who had no previous convictions, had lost his job and was depressed. The attorney said he had borrowed money from a lady whom he repaid but accused him of still owing her. He said Ramcharan was being followed by men sent by her. \\u201cOn that day they were demanding money from him and he was so ashamed and frightened, he didn\\u2019t tell anyone \\u2026 It was an act of stupidity on his part.\\u201d In Ramroops\\u2019 case, the court heard that he sent a message on social media from his Facebook account to his sister Alana Rose Phillip, telling her that he had been kidnapped. A ransom demand of 60,000 was made. Officers conducting interviews and recorded statements. They received a message and went to Reform Road Gasparillo where they saw Ramroop standing at the side of the road with his hands tied and mud on his hands and feet. He later told corporal Mohammed, \\u201cOfficer today I get a video of my ex-girlfriend and that trip me off and I send a message to Alana on Facebook. I really didn\\u2019t get kidnapped ... Officer, I sorry for faking my kidnapping \\u2026 That tabanca really get me dotish. I didn\\u2019t expect it to reach so far. I really shame now.\\u201d He was charged by corporal Shaun Mohammed. Defence attorney Dane Halls said his client who had no previous convictions, was unemployed and lived with is carpenter father and his mother who is a domestic worker. He said Ramroop regularly attended church and although he was on the verge of taking his life over the situation, his biblical teachings made him change his mind. He said the message was sent to his sister in the hope that it would have been forwarded to the ex-girlfriend and led to them rekindling their relationship. Instead, his sister went to their parents. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a good plan \\u2026 The whole thing went awry,\\u201d Halls said. He asked the court to \\u201ctreat with this jilted lover as lenient as possible.\\u201d In both instances Magistrate Kerri-Anne Byer spoke of the strain such actions put on the police\\u2019s resources. \\u201cA battery of police need to come together to solve such a crime.\\u201d She also said that it affects family members and the society and made reference to a recent kidnapping in San Fernando which she said \\u201chad the entire country on edge wondering what could happen.\\u201d In both instances, she started with a sentence of five months.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"The Keith Rowley administration is sure to stir a degree of controversy over its plan to provide laptops for secondary school pupils. Although Education Minister Anthony Garcia had announced in August 2016 that a redesigned laptop programme will see the reintroduction of the mobile devices in schools, the laptops-for-pupils concept remained associated exclusively with the free-spending days of the People\\u2019s Partnership, from 2010 until the PNM\\u2019s return to Government in the first term of the 2015/2016 school year. That association was consolidated by the current administration which, while in opposition and on the campaign trail, had harshly criticised the initiative as more or less useless. In 2010, then Opposition Leader Dr Keith Rowley had assailed the laptop supply to secondary school entrants as a doomed approach toward upgrading first formers. Against that background, the \\u201claptops are back\\u201d announcement on Tuesday was indeed a surprising turn of events. Minister Garcia is yet to elaborate on the philosophical case, and on the advantages for learning and teaching of making available to 153 schools $50 million worth of laptops. It now appears that the PNM administration means to improve upon arrangements for procuring, storage and utilisation of the devices. Minister Garcia argued that 90 per cent of the People\\u2019s Partnership-issued laptops had simply ended up in the dump, without having been used to advance teaching and learning purposes. Under his leadership, the devices will not get into pupils\\u2019 knapsacks and into their homes, subject to use for educationally irrelevant purposes. Moreover, Minister Garcia, through his ministry\\u2019s ICT expert Gerald Phillip, said teachers will receive training on how to incorporate the laptop technology into delivery of their lesson plans. In Mr Phillip\\u2019s understanding, teachers will work with timetables that determine the days and times they will have access to the laptops. When they are done, the devices will be returned to storage. There is no denying the value of computer-related technologies to classroom learning; in fact, the State is late in embracing the various ways technology can assist and advance all school-based learning. One would have thought, though, that given this was the stated intention of the ministry since August 2016, essential groundwork inclusive of the training of teachers would have been near completion by now, just five months ahead of the implementation of the new programme. Concerns also arise from weak security at schools that has been brazenly breached in the recent past. And while the minister did not extend his comments to the numerous textbooks and related paraphernalia students labour to tote to and fro each school day, the ministry is urged to consider how online lessons could alleviate this manual labour to which still-developing minors are subjected. Ultimately, Minister Garcia, in returning to an Opposition programme and redesigning it, has now taken ownership of this new initiative. As such, he can expect it to be unflinchingly evaluated by the higher standards he claims to be setting.

Centenarian William Dominic Sanderson, who looks half his age, will turn 103 years-old this Saturday. Sanderson, born in Grenada and moved to Trinidad in 1936 where he worked as a farmer and labourer. La Brea Member of Parliament Nicole Olivierre, who did a biography of the elderly man, said when Sanderson first moved to Trinidad, he rented a room at a cost of 50 cents per week. However, this was much too expensive so he moved into a carat leaves-covered house paying 40 cents per week. Later in life, Sanderson would purchase a four-room house paying $75. Like many living in the country-side, Sanderson had no electricity and running water, and relied on the use of a flambeaux and three drums of water. Sanderson told Olivierre that back then, neighbours shared everything, and that people did not have refrigerators and stove so they shared their food with each other. The area was a peaceful one, and everyone considered the village\\u2019s children as their own. Even those who went to school barefooted were assured of a meal at the home of someone, she said.

Photo: DEXTER PHILIP Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar today delivered the Opposition's response to the Budget presented by Finance Minister Colm Imbert on Monday. The following is the full address: Thank you, Madam Speaker and thanks to this Honourable House for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the fourth budget presentation of this government. I wish to first place on the Hansard my deepest gratitude to my staff at the Office of the Leader of the Opposition, my staff at the Siparia Constituency Office, all Opposition MPs and their staff, Opposition Senators, UNC Councillors, Aldermen, Members of the UNC National Executive, constituency executives and activists throughout the length and breadth of Trinidad and Tobago. I also wish to thank the numerous stakeholders and the multitude of citizens, in their personal capacities or through various Business organisations or NGOs, CBOs, FBOs, as well as the trade unions who have kindly assisted in the preparation of my response here today, by giving their much needed feedback during our many pre-Budget consultations in every part of the country held in the past several weeks. Their reflections and realities, their suggestions and wishes, their recommendations and pleas, their demands and concerns have ALL been taken into active consideration by myself and my tremendous Opposition team, and it is with the people\\u2019s blessings and direct input that I reply on their behalf today. I give the assurance that I will continue to be your voice, and I stand by your side, I stand with you and I stand for you. From these widespread consultations and, media commentaries, we have identified common crucial concerns including runaway crime, jobs and the economy, health care, education, infrastructure, governance, quality of life and of course Petrotrin in my contribution today I shall address some of these. In the course of the debate, our MPs on this side will also delve into these and other sectors in detail as per their Shadow portfolios. Further, Madam Speaker, today, I want to use this opportunity to share with you some of our comprehensive plans for the advancement, progression and transformation of our nation. We have a vision for a Trinidad and Tobago in which each citizen can enjoy a better quality of life, more prosperity, safety, access to quality healthcare and improved equal opportunities for all. We will re-engineer our society, from one that has to protest for roads, drains and water, to one that is aspirational in nature. We will re-calibrate the chaos that they have created by the mismanagement and incompetence of the Government. We will return Trinidad and Tobago to a nation of prosperity rather than the failed state that they have reduced us to. We will get to work immediately, and we will ensure that the persons they have left unemployed and impoverished will get back to work too. We will do this by rebalancing our finances, reforming our institutions, with particular attention to the State enterprise sector and most importantly we would do all of this with the people at the centre, as the single most important priority to MY government. With diligence, resolve and a shared vision, we can transform our nation, and ensure a brighter future for every single citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. But Madam before I share our plans, we need to first identify the problems which confront us so we can talk about how we go about dealing with these problems. QUESTIONS After 4 PNM Budgets these are some of the questions raised and answers received in the consultations. Do you feel safer today than 3 years ago? No Do you feel secure in your job? No Has the economy improved? No Are you confident enough to open a business? No Has your purchasing power increased? No After three years, are you getting better healthcare? No Are your children getting a better education? No Have they fixed or maintained your roads or improved your drainage? No Are you satisfied with the behaviour of the government? No Has your quality of life improved? The answer is a resounding No. THEME OF MY RESPONSE Let the Hansard record show that after three years of this PNM regime in 2018 they have returned to the politics of the past which chains the majority working class citizens of this country to a life of the working poor with hardly any prospect of social mobility. In fact, in our widespread consultations which I have referenced, a common theme was how people feel totally and completely betrayed by the Prime Minister and Government who are selling them out, just as Jesus the Saviour was sold out by Judas for thirty pieces of silver! They feel abandoned and oppressed by the policies of alienation and pauperisation being implemented, and they have lost their sense of trust in the Government to truly seek their best interests as citizens. With the impending shutdown of the Petrotrin Refinery, our nation\\u2019s greatest modern-day patrimony, we are now on the cusp of perhaps the greatest Crossroads in our Nation\\u2019s History. People have expressed the view that they are now unwilling, vulnerable and helpless pawns, victims of this Government\\u2019s incompetence as the government is plunging our nation into one of the worst social and economic crises in its history. They feel treachery, betrayal and ingratitude to the citizens who put you there\\u2014that is the legacy of this Rowley led PNM Government. As I demonstrate through economic references, comparisons and contrasts, the pattern of broken promises and outright falsehoods by this Government, I daresay that they have breached their social contract with the people who elected them to represent their democratic rights and interests in the best possible way and, instead, this government has returned that sacred trust with a policy of destruction and tyranny. In that context, Madam Speaker, I have chosen as the theme of my presentation here today\\u2014 At the Crossroads of Our Nation\\u2019s History\\u2014A Nation in Crisis: A Government in Collapse; A People Betrayed. HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY Madam Speaker, I indicated that we would first deal with the problems we are facing before we go on to examine what needs to be done. In this case I will look at the vital signs of the economy. What is the state of the health of the Trinidad and Tobago economy? 1) Gross Domestic Product The most critical and common measure of the health of an economy, is the Gross Domestic Product also called the GDP. It\\u2019s the heartbeat of the economy. The GDP is the total value of every product, good or service produced in the country. With puffed up chest and smirking at the population, the Minister of Finance, looking at the GDP, boasted in his normal manner that \\u201cThe Trinidad and Tobago Economy is projected to grow in real terms by 1.9 percent in 2019\\u201d. (Budget Speech 2019, page 2). On the basis of this, the Minister crowed that the economy is experiencing a \\u201cgenuine economic turnaround\\u201d thanks to his sound fiscal and financial management. This was actually a repeat of his mid-year review commentary in which he first announced this \\u201cturnaround\\u201d. Let me make it quite clear, no one will be happier than I, if there were an economic turnaround and the quality of life of all our citizens improved. But, we know that we cannot believe anything this Minister says. Looking at the Minister\\u2019s own statistics, I discovered evidence of the usual statistical gymnastics of Minister Imbert. Far from expansion, in the last three years the economy of Trinidad and Tobago has shrunk, in REAL terms, thanks to the policies of this Government. By 2015, the real GDP was 170.4 billion dollars. In 2018, after three years of the PNM under Minister Imbert, real GDP was 159.2 billion dollars, a reduction of 11.2 billion dollars in the last three years. (Review of the Economy 2018, page 80, Appendix 1) Any Standard 1 child will tell you that 159 is less than 170. But this Minister of Finance foolishly boasts of a recovery! We have the figures now and the population of Trinidad and Tobago can see clearly now that there is no turnaround. This means that under Minister Imbert\\u2019s management, the economy actually contracted by 6.5 percent over the past three years. In fact, according to the Minister\\u2019s own figures, the GDP at current prices is lower than what it was in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Under his stewardship, the size of the economy today is 10 percent smaller than it was in 2014, the last full year under my People\\u2019s Government. Our economy has not grown \\u2013 it has shrunk under this Minister\\u2019s watch, where is the turnaround? The Minister, however, doesn\\u2019t want you looking at his tenure. The Minister prefers we only look at last year 2017 and compare it to this year, 2018. Minister Imbert wants us to forget that they were in charge since September 2015. That it is this Government that has crashed the economy. But the difference is even more pronounced when you look at the difference between last year and this year\\u2019s GDP. Do you know what accounts for the increased GDP figures between last year and this year? It is a 30.7 percent increase in a component called taxes less subsidies on products! So, this Minister has claimed to GROW the economy in the last year by increasing taxation! Nothing to do with generating revenue, creating jobs. The growth in the economy that the Minister is boasting about is because of the increased tax burden on citizens and businesses! VAT, Green Fund and Business Levy, corporation tax, elimination of fuel subsidies, tyre duties, online purchase tax, alcohol tax, tobacco tax, inspection fee, environmental tax, gaming taxes...all of these taxes Madam Speaker. By this measure, the more he taxes you they think the better the economy grows, and the Minister is now depending on the implementation of the property tax in 2019 for economic growth next year. Not surprisingly, Minister Imbert in an interview recently promised no new taxes until after 2020. He\\u2019s right you know, because we will be in office in 2020. He glossed over the fact that his desperate pursuit of the new property tax (when he will tax up to your fowl coop, dog kennel and pooja room) will adversely impact the pocket and disposable income of every citizen. It is hypocrisy to say no new taxes when in 2019 they\\u2019ve said they\\u2019re going to implement property tax. a) Non-Energy Sector The Minister has repeatedly spoken about the improved performance of the non-energy sector. Well, let\\u2019s look at the figures. Between 2015 and 2017, Mining and quarrying fell by 5 billion dollars, construction contracted by 1 billion dollars, trade and repairs by 6 billion dollars, transport and storage contracted by almost a billion dollars. All these sectors have suffered deep contractions under this Government. The Minister touted the success in the manufacturing sector, but he has not told us that he has now lumped petroleum and chemical products which were formerly under the energy sector. But even with the additional almost 1.5 billion dollars from petroleum and chemical products to expand the manufacturing sector there is negligible change in that sector. Interestingly too, the manufacture of petrochemicals, refining including LPG, and petroleum support services have increased their contribution to the GDP in the last year. It is certain that the closure of Petrotrin will dramatically lower the recent gains in output from these sectors come 2019. The one sector the Minister could have had some influence on over the past three years in office was the manufacturing sector. And the Minister HAS influenced the sector, negatively. Where is the economic recovery in all of this? You will forgive me for having absolutely no confidence in this Minister\\u2019s untruthful claims. The fact is that thanks to the policies put in place by my Government in 2014, and inherited by the PNM, the country is now experiencing an uptick in natural gas production which has improved the fortunes of the energy sector. The energy sector has therefore grown, despite the incompetence of the Minister. The Head of BP in an interview made it clear that incentives pursued under our watch led to the Juniper project and others. Why don\\u2019t you blame us for that, you blame us for everything else? I will speak to issues in the Energy Sector including Petrotrin later. As a result of this hapless government\\u2019s policies, what we are witnessing in Trinidad and Tobago, is a crisis of confidence in the non-energy sector. This crisis of confidence has resulted in there being no new investment in the non-energy sector since they came into office three years ago. And don\\u2019t tell me you did Unicomer because that was done under my watch. Between the distortionary taxation policies including property tax threats, runaway crime, unavailability of foreign exchange, absence of a trade and foreign policy, the traditional manufacturing sector is reeling - particularly the small and medium sized enterprises - the veritable engine of growth in an economy such as ours. Government incompetence has resulted in the precipitous fall in our rank in the Ease of Doing Business 2018 from a modest 79th in 2015 to 102nd place today. Last year this same Minister came to the Parliament and got approval to establish a system of allowances for exports by manufacturers. But the Minister NEVER introduced it! They are a Government of announcements. No follow through, no implementation. After three years, this PNM government has shown that it does not have a clue about what to do to grow the economy. Nothing has been determined. In fact, when you look at their Vision 2030 Report on Progress 2015-2018, it is amazing that when you open this book, the baseline, target performance indicators \\u2013 you see \\u201cto be determined.\\u201d We are reaping the whirlwind of the PNM\\u2019s incompetence today. The only plan they have is to blame Kamla and pray for the incentives she put in place for the energy sector to bear fruit. Earlier this year, non-energy manufacturers reminded the Ministry of Finance of the perennial problem of long outstanding VAT refunds . This follows complaints late last year that billions in VAT refunds were outstanding to businesses. VAT refunds belong to the business community. It\\u2019s their money, not Minister Imbert\\u2019s. Do you know, for almost three hours the Minister spoke here and not a single word on how, when the VAT issued would be addressed. The attitude of the Government towards genuine business concerns confronting SMEs is another reason why the sector is in decline. In our pre-Budget meetings with the people, we have been told of numerous cases of SMEs closing down, forced to send employees home as a result of the policies of this government. It is grossly unfair that the businesses have to pay penalties if they file late, but there is no penalty for the Government in delaying VAT refunds. They are holding on to the VAT refunds, because as Minister West said recently in anticipation of the budget, and knowing that it would be raised as one obvious factor affecting the operations of SMEs in particular, Minister West announced that while she appreciated that businesses depended on the VAT refunds, she said: \\u201cIn addressing the issue of VAT refunds cognizance is taken of the country\\u2019s prevailing economic climate and its impact on Government\\u2019s fiscal accounts and its cash management capability. Accordingly, the level of refunds falls among one of several economic variables which are constantly monitored to ensure that Government\\u2019s overall macro-fiscal objectives are maintained in a scenario of other competing demands for financial resources. This is why the economy is not growing, because of their incompetence, but not only that, they simply do not care. Madam Speaker, oOur consultations already revealed the fears of this large class of businessmen with the impending closure of Petrotrin and other companies. The effect of this failure to develop and implement any policy to stimulate the manufacturing sector is already being felt by a significant fall in the traditional manufacturing sector\\u2019s contribution to real GDP, (minus output from the petrochemical sector) by 600 million dollars in the three years this Government has been in office. Turnaround? Where. They took a sector with tremendous potential and turned around and destroyed it. Ironically, while they dismantle the manufacturing sector the country\\u2019s need for its survival grows exponentially. I have said it before and I say it again: that this Government is a \\u201cBig People\\u201d government. For the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance small businessmen are enemies. But it\\u2019s not just our domestic business sector that lacks confidence in the Government and the economy as a result. The World Bank reported that after receiving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows of over 855 US million dollars in 2014 and 2015, the country suffered a significant net outflow of 398 US million dollars in 2016 and 2017. This means that the money is leaving \\u2013 capital flight under the management of the current Minister of Finance. What this means is that the country not received foreign direct investment during those years and the absence of confidence in the management of the country resulted in the US dollar equivalent of almost 3 billion TT dollars leaving the country. The business community is simply not interested in reinvesting their profits and prefer to repatriate it. Frankly, I do not see the potential for growth of the non-energy sector under the current conditions, and most definitely under this Government. I do not see the overly ambitious projection of a 2 percent growth in 2021. In fact, I have taken note of the multiple projections of the Minister based on the latest IMF report, and I find it extremely disingenuous, to say the least, for the Minister to throw up the IMF projections for growth of the Trinidad and Tobago economy and associated indicators, when he knows fully well, that those figures did not factor in the contractionary effect on revenues, foreign exchange generation, productive capacity, labour, government taxation and expenditure, consequent to the dismantling of Petrotrin. In other words the IMF had no knowledge and did not factor in the shutdown of Petrotrin. The Minister\\u2019s surprise decision to shut down the Petrotrin oil refinery without advising his advisors, the IMF, means that the IMF growth projections are misinformed, and wrong. The Minister\\u2019s use of them therefore is a deliberate attempt to hoodwink the population into believing a projection which he himself knows is untrue. b) Energy Sector I turn now to the energy sector. The Minister of Finance has boasted that there was a return to growth in the economy. The Minister said he projected growth of 1.9% in 2018. i) \\u201cTurnaround\\u201d in Gas Production This growth is due mainly to an increase in natural gas production from the BP Juniper Project which started in the second half of 2017. This project brought 590 million cubic feet of natural gas per day into production. What the Finance Minister doesn\\u2019t like to tell you is that BP\\u2019s decision to invest over US 2.1 Billion US Dollars in this project happened during our time in government (August 2014) due in part to fiscal incentives we offered. Construction began almost immediately. Today the nation is reaping those benefits. Further investment projects including Angelin, TROC and BHP Greater Angostura came to fruition during my administration. When these additional projects come fully on line, at least an additional 900 million cubic feet of natural gas will be produced per day helping to reach the target of 4 Billion cubic feet of Natural gas per day. These investments happened because we put in place an aggressive exploration strategy by incentivizing seismic companies, the up streamers (BP, Shell, and BHP) to find NEW reserves of Hydrocarbons. This strategy was successful. Had these investments not been made at that time, the situation in the country today would have been dire. We are not seeing the same level of foreign direct investment that we saw in our times. That is a consequence of the lack of plan and vision in the Keith Rowley government. i) Gas Supply Contracts (Business Environment) While the Minister of Energy was busy praising his friend A&V drilling, an unprecedented level of hostility emerged between the Ministry, NGC and companies at Point Lisas. This became evident when NGC and Caribbean Nitrogen Company (CNC) Limited publicly went to war over a gas supply contract. Tact and diplomacy are not the way of this Prime Minister\\u2019s Rowley\\u2019s Government. CNC actually shut down temporarily and threatened to leave the country because of its difficulty in negotiating with the Government. It is no secret that plants at Point Lisas are facing significant increases in the price of the natural gas they purchase from the NGC. The Ministry of Energy confirmed this in a press release dated July 26, 2018 when they accused CNC of being petulant. But Madam Speaker, the main reason for the increase in the price of natural gas for companies on the Point Lisas Estate appears to be the new contract between the NGC and EOG Resources; a contact price which the Prime Minister admitted that he negotiated in a hotel room in Houston in March 2017. ii) Stagnation in Energy (Future Problems Looming) During our time, we made fourteen amendments to the fiscal regime aimed at creating a business-friendly environment to facilitate investment that led to the recent surge in natural gas production. After 3 years of this PNM Government we can see no investment in our future. There is only incompetence in HD, High Definition. First there was Machel MM HD (not my colleague Marlene McDonald), MM HD, now it is PNM HD. For example, we see that: \\uf0a7 There has not been a single new bid round. \\uf0a7 A steady decline in drilling which can be measured in rig days from 2765 in 2015 down to 1831 in 2017. \\uf0a7 A marked decrease in exploration and production both on land and offshore. \\uf0a7 Unregulated ageing infrastructure which is not being properly maintained. \\uf0a7 Not a single new license or a new Production Sharing Contract has been awarded since September 2015. No bids mean no further exploration, if you do not explore you do not find any new supplies. All of this means we are headed for a period of stagnation in the Energy Sector This Government is not adequately investing in our future. c) Debt The level of indebtedness of a nation is another indicator of an economy\\u2019s health. This PNM administration has embarked on a dangerous borrowing path to take this country straight into the hands of the IMF and its structural adjustment policies. As at June 2018, the country\\u2019s Gross Public Debt stood at 122.1 billion dollars, which is the highest it has ever been in our recorded history. Our children and grandchildren will have to clean up the mess that this current administration is making. It is a debt-funded disaster. It is a balance sheet meltdown and it mortgages the future generation away. Instead of transferring savings for future generations, this government is hell bent on transferring insurmountable debt to the future generations of this country. Let me begin by stating that I have absolutely no problem with a Government borrowing, per se. What I have a problem with is why the Minister continues to borrow so much and more than that - what is being done with the money borrowed? Where is it being spent? They are boldfacedly taking credit for the Point Fortin Hospital, and now the Couva Children\\u2019s Hospital. Where the money gone? Government debt of necessity must be tied to the country\\u2019s capacity to repay that debt in the medium to long term, particularly as debt implicates future generations to repay. And it is on this very fundamental principle which I disagree with THIS government\\u2019s rabid borrowing profile. In just three years, this government has already borrowed over 20 billion dollars. Today, the country\\u2019s net public sector debt outstanding stands at 96.6 billion dollars, the highest in our nation\\u2019s history. And this does not include the additional 4.2 billion dollars taken out of the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund (HSF) and another 4 billion dollars lifted from the public via the National Investment Fund (NIF) bond issue, the latter of which the Minister miraculously named \\u201cprofits from state enterprises\\u201d even though those revenues are generated by assets owned by taxpayers which must be repaid. In whose imagination can debt be considered profit? Minister Imbert spent a total of over 150 billion dollars since 2015. This has pushed up the net public sector debt by over 13 percent. But the numbers show an even more frightening reflection of Minister Imbert\\u2019s fiscal incompetence, and that is the trend of increasing borrowing. This country is being run on borrowed money with no end in sight. This is not a mark of competent fiscal management. To make matters worse, when the Minister ran out of borrowing headroom, the Minister of Finance used the PNM\\u2019s parliamentary majority to raise borrowing limits so that they can continue to borrow above what the law initially limited them to do. And borrow they have. This Government has used every possible opportunity to borrow indiscriminately, in addition to taxing our citizens into poverty. As one soca artiste has said \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t bring joy, you kill joy.\\u201d The problem is that no one can see what this government has done with the 20 billion dollars they have borrowed because, they are using it for \\u201cbudget support and debt refinancing\\u201d, and they are spending on recurrent expenditure and vanity projects. There have been no projects initiated by this government, which have the capacity to generate a consistent revenue stream in the near future. Every project the government has ever mentioned as a revenue generator has been \\u201ccoming soon\\u201d from the scandalous Sandals scheme to the La Brea Chinese dry-docking facility. But no one can see or feel what they have done with the 150 billion dollars they spent. There are many ways of analyzing debt figures. Certainly, the most common is Debt to GDP which since this Government has come into office has grown from 47.8 percent in fiscal 2015 to 61 percent in FY 2018. This is already cause for concern. However, as with the household debt, I think Government debt should best be looked at relative to Government revenue. In 2015, the Central Government Debt to Revenue ratio was 1.5 meaning that it would have taken roughly one and a half years using all of the country\\u2019s revenues to wipe out the country\\u2019s debt. Today, thanks to this government\\u2019s policies, repaying this massive PNM debt would take two and a half years using every cent collected as Government Revenue. In other words, if every cent collected by the PNM from now until they demit office in 2020 is applied to retire the debt, it would not be sufficient. Today, even as the Government robs people of their jobs, the debt load being carried by every single employee is 155,000 thousand dollars. And this is significant because it is the working population which must carry this heavy debt burden. There is yet more reason to be concerned, and that is the increasing component of foreign debt as a percentage of our overall debt. Under this government, foreign debt has jumped to 26.6 per cent of total debt (June 2018) from 16.3 percent of total debt under my watch (September 2015). What this means is that increasing demands are being put on our dwindling foreign exchange reserves, leaving less for the importation of medicines, raw materials, finished products and food. Today, half of the country\\u2019s foreign reserves are mortgaged to repay the external debt. All of these factors point towards an inherent danger of our country being unable to meet this runaway debt, particularly the foreign debt, putting us at the mercy of countries engaged in what has been described as debt diplomacy. As policy makers, we must demand an explanation from this government of how they propose to meet the new debt obligations with which they are saddling Trinidad and Tobago, in addition to the existing billions of debts. Unfortunately, there is no policy statement which remotely suggests that any attention is being paid to this critical concern. How are we going to repay this massive and growing debt? Instead this PNM Government continues to borrow to fund their addiction for vanity projects, continues to commit to the expenditure of foreign exchange to repay debt, continues to deny access to foreign exchange to citizens and small businesses to the benefit of friends, family and financiers of the PNM (triple F rated government). This Minister is drowning us in a red sea of debt and says it is because they have no money. If we are to believe their own words, then how did they get the money to spend on these vanity projects that brought no relief to the people of Trinidad and Tobago. 2) Vanity Projects and Priorities Let us look at the priorities of this government in the past 4 budgets and the people of this country could judge for themselves whether the government\\u2019s priorities are in line with the needs of the population. They can judge whether stadiums, castles, golf courses and paintings have made their lives better, their pockets heavier and their families safer. I want to remind the Minister of Finance of what he said in his first budget presentation of this administration. I quote the MOF October 5th 2015 \\u201cand rather than wasting money on expensive white elephants and vanity projects, we will expend substantial resources on training opportunities in all areas \\u201c. It is clearly evident that the minister has a very short memory but it is even clearer that the Minister is something resembling an impostor because none of these promises have been kept. While the Minister of Finance and his government ran up and down this country misleading the population that the treasury was empty and that the country was running on fumes. This is what the PNM government has found money to spend on, these are their priorities. These are the priorities of expenditure that the PNM has embarked on in three years from four budgets, what they would have the entire country believe is that the treasury was empty but here you can see that their waste, mismanagement and corruption is reflected in their extravagance, callousness and disregard for poor people in this country. They punished the population for three years. They took bread and butter out of the mouths of citizens, babies went hungry because their priorities were on the following: \\u2022 PAINTINGS 3M \\u2022 SOCA ON THE SEAS .5M \\u2022 NEW MERECEDES BENZ FOR THE PM 2M \\u2022 CL FINANCIAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT SETTLEMENT 3.5M \\u2022 A HELLO AND GOODBYE TELEPHONE CALL TO THE US PRESIDENT 16M \\u2022 TAROUBA STADIUM THAT STILL HAS NO ACCREDITATION 130M \\u2022 RED HOUSE THAT THEY PROMISED TO DELIVER IN MAY 2018 44OM \\u2022 BUCCO ESTATE 174M \\u2022 LOAN TO THE TOILET PAPER FACTORY 30M \\u2022 TRADE UNIONS 15M \\u2022 MASSY COMMUNICATION 225M (AMPLIA) \\u2022 ERNST & YOUNG AUDITS 20M \\u2022 JAZZ FESTIVAL 20M \\u2022 PRIME MINISTER\\u2019S HOUSE IN TOBAGO 15M \\u2022 DIEGO MARTIN STADIUM 200M \\u2022 CABO STAR MOBILIZATION FEE 13M \\u2022 OCEAN FLOWER MOBILIZATION FEE 20M \\u2022 HILTON SWIMMING POOL 7M \\u2022 WET LEASE PLANE FROM LIAT 4M \\u2022 FETE MATCH TO OPEN LARA STADIUM \\u2022 SHAMFA 59,000 ROAMING BILL \\u2022 DARRYL SMITH ROMPING 95,000 \\u2022 SETTLEMENT OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR IN MINISTRY OF SPORT 150,000 \\u2022 4 BOATS WITHOUT ANY PROPER PROCUREMENT 1.4BILLION \\u2022 DOG POUND 3M, AH DOG POUND! a) OVERDRAFT The Minister of Finance made a lot of noise about my Government reaching close to the limit of the overdraft facility. While we made use of the permissible overdraft limit, let me remind the Minister of Finance that in fiscal year 2016/2017, he actually crossed the limit of the overdraft by over 3 billion dollars without a single tangible project to show for it. (Auditor General report 2017 pg NO. 97). The Auditor General also reported that the Exchequer Account has been in overdraft since 2003. Let me also remind the Minister of Finance that the latest IMF Report (2018) has scolded this Government for persistently maxing out the overdraft at the Central Bank. In fact, the IMF recommends in the Report that this Government settle the outstanding overdraft balance at the Central Bank, and rely on market-based financing for its fiscal operations. I remind this House that in December 2017, this same Minister came running to the Parliament to increase the overdraft ceiling from 15% revenue to 20%. What that means is after the Minister super maxed the overdraft, he came for more of your money! The same Minister who chastised my Government for utilizing the overdraft facility. I will call a spade a spade and a hypocrite a hypocrite. And the difference is, we can show \\u2013 our projects you can touch and see, this PNM Government has nothing to show for their spending. This is the level of hypocrisy of this PNM Government! 3) Foreign Exchange Reserves In a country as import driven as Trinidad and Tobago, our ability to purchase goods and services, from food to medical supplies hinges on our ability to generate and manage foreign exchange. This then is another indicator of the economy\\u2019s health. In his very first budget speech delivered on October 20th 2015, the Minister declared that \\u201crebuilding confidence in the management of the foreign exchange market represents a central thrust as we revitalize our national economy. The current situation is untenable and has contributed to great uncertainty and capital flight.\\u201d The situation the Minister was saying is unacceptable was a foreign reserve holding of 10.5 billion US dollars which constituted almost 1 year of import cover. Today, after three years of PNM, the level of net foreign exchange holdings has collapsed by 27 percent to 7.6 billion US dollars, just about 8 months import cover, the lowest our reserves have been for over a decade. And they want to talk about growth and recovery. Last month, Republic Bank Limited, RBC Royal Bank and Scotiabank all confirmed that demand for foreign exchange far outstrips the supply, and that the banks were unable to satisfy their customer\\u2019s needs. And do you know why people are seeking this foreign exchange? RBC reported that the business demand for forex is to settle outstanding invoices to foreign suppliers, capital investments, regular travel, education, and medical needs. TTMA President Christopher Alcazar noted that while things have improved COMPARED TO THIS TIME LAST YEAR, it is still not at the level required for easy access by manufacturers. TT Chamber of industry and Commerce Gabriel Faria reported that a June 2018 survey of their members revealed that many of them continued to have challenges accessing foreign exchange with companies having to wait for extended periods to collect enough to make their purchases of raw materials and finished products. Faria said that follow up interviews in July and August, reported that there was no improvements in access to foreign exchange. Earlier this year too, we had the embarrassing situation where traders from St Vincent and the Grenadines were forced to ask for the intervention of their Prime Minister in order to access foreign exchange despite having adequate TT currency in their accounts. But they are not alone. In the past three years, several companies have closed down, including franchise holders, while others have had to scale down operations as the Government tightened availability of, and access to foreign exchange including the tax last year on credit card purchases. Persons who need foreign exchange for medical purposes, citizens sacrificing to educate their children abroad including in the Caribbean, small and medium sized businesses which depend on imported inputs, even the average nationals who are travelling on vacation are unable to get foreign exchange and have to make repeated visits to the banks and harass tellers for US$100 here and there. And this problem continues to worsen: \\u00b7 The agreement to purchase purchase gas from the Venezuela; \\u00b7 The purchase of vessels without proper procurement; \\u00b7 The shutdown of Petrotrin and resultant requirement to import all fuels and refined petroleum products; \\u00b7 The signing of multiple agreements with international companies including Chinese firms on the basis of access to concessional loans without any procurement mechanisms and regulation. This government continues to compete with manufacturers, SME, traders and the average citizens for foreign exchange. Given this situation, one would have expected that the Government would have either reduced its own appetite for foreign exchange or engaged in activities designed to generate significant investment in projects with the capability to generate foreign exchange. Instead what we have witnessed is opposite. In the last three years, there has not been a single project which the Government could point the population at which will generate the additional foreign exchange desperately required in the short or medium term. Projects such as Sandals Tobago project and the La Brea drydock facility are shrouded in secrecy. So where then will this increased foreign exchange come from? It appears that the only plan that the Government has is to continue to raid the HSF and to borrow, borrow, borrow. 4) Inflation The Minister of Finance came to the Parliament patting himself on the back boasting that they have lowered the inflation rate to 1% in August 2018. When one looks at the Inflation rate it is deceptive because: Firstly, there has been a rebasing of the Consumer Price Index recently and as a result the methodology has changed so the inflation rate could be a bit deceptive as they would have altered the weights of the items in the basket of goods. Secondly, the economy is characterized by low business confidence with a stagnant non-energy sector and inflation approaching near zero. These are signs of a deflationary economy. Thirdly, rising unemployment levels and resulting falling demand means the population simply does not have the money to pay higher prices. The government which is the largest consumer in the domestic market has contributed to weakened demand in the local economy by cutting expenditure and in particular expenditure towards PSIP. Simple economic theory outlines that during downturns or recessionary periods in an economy, one byproduct so to speak is a decline in the rate of inflation. I wish to remind the population that low inflation means prices are rising not falling, they are just rising slowly. Prices are high and still rising when inflation is low. Consequently, I want to draw your attention and the attention of the national community to the challenges that we as mothers, fathers, homemakers, guardians, providers and breadwinners face in this country. With their own numbers which can be found on the Ministry of Trade and Industry website September 2018 let us look at prices of a basic basket of goods compared to the prices of those same goods under a People\\u2019s Partnership administration. We are not talking about the items the Minister of Sport and Youth Affairs enjoys, like almond milk and yogurt; We are talking about a basic basket of sugar, butter, salt, milk, baby milk, peas, oil, tea, sardine, ketchup, peas and carrots and rice. Between 2015 when the partnership left office to today\\u2019s date using the data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry website a basic basket of goods has increased by over 21%. The Ministry of Trade lists 117 items that\\u2019s could be found on their website with prices. It gives you a break down and a comparison that helps to guide whether items have increased or decreased. You would not be surprised to hear that out of the 117 items, the prices of 101 items have gone up under the PNM compared to the prices that we left them with. This also tells you that the consumer has less purchasing power and that the government through its own actions eroded purchasing power from the consumer and then boasts that inflation is low. While several economists have disputed the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s inflation figures and the justification for those figures, any student studying principles of business in form three and up can tell you that when demand is low inflation is also low in some economies. Somalia is a prime example of that; they have a very low inflation rate yet there is tremendous economic strife and if one were to fact check the Minister of Finance Trinidad and Tobago ranks 88th on the global index. a) Food Prices GROCERY ITEMS PRICE SEPTEMBER 2018 PRICE SEPTEMBER 2015 PRICE DIFFERENCE CHICKEN BREAST (Frozen) $ 19.98 $18.40 $ 1.58 CHICKEN DRUMSTICK (Frozen) $ 21.74 $18.29 $ 3.44

factor which affects the health of our economy, not surprisingly is fiscal policy. In some of the problems I raised earlier, the hand of the government is obvious. However, I refer specifically to the current taxation and expenditure policy undertaken by the Minister of Finance which is distortionary, resulting in an investment climate unfavorable to fostering business confidence and engagement. This government has adopted a fiscal policy of increased taxation, sale of assets and borrowing to generate funds. But they are not using these funds to build productive capacity; instead they are using these funds to finance recurrent expenditure. The result is predictable: the continued contraction of the economy, which in turn has caused a sharp reduction in the tax base so that in 2018, the revenue from taxation was almost $11 billion lower than in 2015 before the advent of more and higher taxes. More tax, less revenue. That has been the hallmark of this Minister of Finance. A similar situation exists with government spending. The last three years has been characterized by virtual collapse in expenditure under the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP), from $8.16 billion in 2015 \\u2013 to build roads, schools, police stations \\u2013 PSIP spending reduced to $3.53 billion in the 2018 financial year. This means the Minister has not provided any fiscal stimulus to help support the recessionary economy. Even more alarming is that this government lacks the capability to successfully implement desperately needed capital projects and even with their own vanity projects. Unfortunately, as in every other sphere, Minister Imbert failed. In the Review of the Economy 2018, the government confesses that: \\u201c.. expenditure on Government\\u2019s Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) in 2018 was lower-than-budgeted. This was primarily due to delays in the implementation of projects; variations in the scope of work for several projects; non-submission of claims by contractors and administrative delays in the processing of claims for payment. (Page 41 ROTE 2018) Too, the Government has continued its habit of withdrawing funds allocated to infrastructural projects to engage in recurrent expenditure, a matter which I raised last year. The Minister\\u2019s incompetence is demonstrated by the fact that he has failed to put the budget on a path to fiscal sustainability. He has run large budget deficits for the last three years, intends to run another large budget deficit in the coming year, and with elections looming is likely to run a substantial budget deficit in 2020. We can expect five years of budget deficits under Minister Imbert. Where\\u2019s the proclaimed turnaround? 6) Labour \\u2013 Unemployment a) The Great Betrayal The worst examples of the Government\\u2019s hypocrisy and betrayal - and there have been many - has been the deliberate brutalization and terrorizing of our nation\\u2019s labour force. When the then Opposition Leader Dr Rowley asked this country for their vote in 2015, he sat with members of several unions, signed agreements, promised all manner of interaction, access and support, and appointed a former PSA President as the Minister of Labour to represent labour interests. You will recall, workers were told: \\u201cthe PNM will establish an appropriate set of minimum wage rates, based on updated data from the household budgetary surveys and the cost of living index. We will ensure through employment exchanges managed by the regional corporations that workers can transition with job specific training to self-employment and better paying jobs in the public and private sector.\\u201d Not a single promise to workers have been kept. Instead of creating skilled employment opportunities \\u2013 the PNM is scrapping entire industries that require a specialist labour force. The imminent closure of the Petrotrin refinery means nearly 5,000 skilled workers will out of a job by next month. The Prime Minister said the numbers do not matter but these are human beings with families. So not only are they not creating new jobs, they are taking away what already exists! In his presentation here on Monday, Minister Imbert glossed over the issue of unemployment because according to him, \\u201cthe number of employed persons has only decreased marginally.\\u201d Over 50,000 have lost their jobs since they came in office. 30,000 by their own admission. As a result, he felt confident to announce that the unemployment rate was around 5 percent. That is simply not true. None of it. Minister Imbert further claims that: \\u201cThe unemployment rate is now in the vicinity of 5 percent, not substantially different to those rates which existed in the 2011 to 2015 period.\\u201d That is another fabrication by Minister Imbert. Let me remind him of what the employment rate was in those years. In 2011, the unemployment rate was 5 percent, in 2012 it was 4.9 percent, in 2013 it stood at 3.7 percent, in 2014 it was at a historic 3.3 percent and in 2015 the unemployment rate was 3.4 percent. That\\u2019s what he met when he came in, an unemployment rate at 3.4 percent. Earlier this year, in this very Chamber, Minister Imbert attacked several economists because their views were not aligned to his. He said then: \\u201cThere are people in this country who just talk out of a hat. They know nothing and they just talk. They say things and have no facts. They have no information. They have no data. They don\\u2019t have a clue what they are talking about. But they just say things.\\u201d Madam Speaker, he was speaking about himself. The result has been the failure of the state to engage in behaviour designed to establish an enabling environment and to create jobs. This is unacceptable. Worse it is a critical factor impacting on the productive capacity of the country and its revenue and tax base. The Minister of Finance is making prescriptive billion-dollar decisions, promoting projects of all kinds and in various locales, without the benefit of information. He is lost and he should know it. I read somewhere that he who knows not, and knows not that he knows not, is a fool. Shun him. From what I have just outlined we see that our economy is in bad shape \\u2013 it is sick. 7) PNM Prescriptions Our country is facing a crisis of confidence and we have heard of no comprehensive, concrete or viable plans from this Government to treat with and lead to our recovery. What prescriptions have they offered to fix our sick economy? They came with the same repeated promises that they\\u2019ve been announcing over and over - we\\u2019re hearing again about the Moruga port, the Valencia to Toco Highway, we keep hearing about Sandals, and now the newest thing since sliced bread, a drydocking project at La Brea. They said \\u201cLet\\u2019s do this\\u201d that they had a \\u201cDr\\u201d to fix the economy but based on all the economic vitals, it is clear that the economy is Sick, Sick, Sick and is flatlining; this Doctor is guilty of Malpractice and should be fired. a) PNM Repeated Promises/No Delivery The PNM has a history of repeat, repeat, repeat with no performance and no delivery. For the past 4 budgets we have heard several of these promises. Let us look at some of the PNM- THE PROMISES THAT NEVER MATERIALISED 1. Budget 1, 2, 3, 4 of this administration we heard the repeated promise of the establishment of the TTRA, no delivery, failed not done. 2. Budget 1, 2, 3,4 the repeated promise of the property tax for efficient tax collection and revenue no delivery, failed not done. 3. Budget 1, 2, 3, 4 of this administration they have repeated the promise to complete the Point Fortin highway, no progress has been made in this regard since the People\\u2019s Partnership left office. 4. Budget 1,2,3,4 of this administration we have heard about the Toco highway up to this time no construction has begun, no progress. 5. In some of our rural areas fishing is the life blood of economic activity. The Minister of Finance once again announced the Moruga Fishing Port (p. 16). The Minister of Finance said a new fishing port in Moruga and associated facilities is in the design stage. 6. Budget 1,2,3,4 the government promised the san Fernando waterfront project. So far, the land has not even been acquired far less for any construction. Failure and no delivery. 7. Budget 2, 3, 4 the Minister of Finance promised the curepe interchange up to this time the acquisition of the land has not been completed far less for any construction. 8. Budget 2, 3 ,4 the Minister of finance has promised the delivery of the Point Fortin and Arima hospitals only because the construction was underway and started by the PP GOVT. 9. In the last budget the Minister of finance assured us that there was a way forward with respect to the opening of the Couva Children\\u2019s Hospital, one year later the hospital still is not open and there is no indication that there will be any immediate progress in this regard. 10. Budget 1, 2, 3, 4 the Minister has promised the sandals project up to this day we are nowhere closer to laying one brick or turning one shovel of gravel and cement. That is their record. Promise and never deliver. Madam Speaker it is with a heavy heart that I now turn to the sea bridge. The country continues to suffer under this merciless PNM Government, having endured the utter incompetence of not just one, but two Ministers of Works and Transport that led to a total breakdown of the sea-bridge between Trinidad and Tobago with the destructive force of a Category 5 hurricane, wreaked havoc on Tobago\\u2019s economy, which has been described as a \\u2018total collapse\\u2019 of businesses in Tobago. The most troubling part of it all is that the nation has received no assurance that this PNM Government will ever change its process and method for procuring capital assets. Until such time, we are doomed to suffer the calamitous consequences as we have endured with the saga known as the Galleons Passage, which, having been purchased some 10 months ago is yet to make a commercial sailing. It can only be described as a monumental waste that has burned a hole in taxpayers\\u2019 pocket to the tune of over $120 Million Dollars. And our woes do not end there. Just imagine, after being serviced a mere couple days ago, the top deck of the Cabo Star was reportedly flooded out on its voyage yesterday. From the evidence presented to you and the nation we can see a clear strategy of deception, untruths, falsehood and fabrication. Madam I want to share with you the definition of AN IMPOSTOR it is a person who pretends to be someone else in order to deceive others, especially for fraudulent gain. Having presented my case on this matter I leave it up to the population to judge for themselves. b) That La Brea Drydock Prime Minister Rowley announced that the proposed La Brea facility was going to ease the foreign exchange burden of Trinidad and Tobago. Based on a recent Trinidad guardian story, for the Prime Minister, this single La Brea drydock project is his government\\u2019s solution to our foreign exchange crisis, and our need to grow the GDP. But a careful read of the information contained in the article reveals the depth of the deception by the PNM Leader. The deception is not just that PM Rowley is asking residents of La Brea to vote for him in 2020 in the hope of getting jobs in 2023 when he claims this project will start operations. The deception is not just that there will be no foreign exchange generated by this project for years to come. The deception is not just the untruth that \\u201ca large number\\u201d of the thousands of people he is firing from Petrotrin will bring their skills and get jobs in the project, because everyone knows that the skills and training required to work in a refinery and in exploration and drilling are not the same as to work on a dry dock. The deception is not just that no local content agreement has been signed for labour and materials. For me, what is most frightening is the admission that THEY HAVE NOT DONE A MARKET ANALYSIS YET! On what basis are all these promises being made? How do they know that this project is even viable or that 5,000 jobs can be created? You are making it up as you go along! The promise that \\u201cthe Chinese have agreed to arrange for their ships to use the La Brea facility\\u201d is no guarantee of a market. How many Chinese or other vessels have expressed an interest in coming to Trinidad to be dry docked? Is the plan to build the facility, at an unknown financial cost to Trinidad and Tobago, and HOPE that it is used? What happens when the facility is unable to attract sufficient clientele? Will the dry dock have to be ceded to a foreign state? Is this another WGTL waiting to happen? Even worse, the report states that China will control 30 percent of the equity in the project and the Trinidad and Tobago Government will control 70 percent. What is the source of these funds? Is the Government going to be drawing down a loan from China for this purpose? If so, this constitutes a further and significant foreign exchange debt on a project for which the Government cannot prove a confirmed market as they haven\\u2019t even done the basic research. This PNM administration has already wasted three years hopelessly trying to stabilize our economy, and given their poor track record of economic management, they will waste another two years into 2020. Their economic policymaking is characterized by incompetence, illiteracy and insensitivity. UNC NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND DIVERSIFICATION PLAN Madam Speaker I wish to share with you the UNC\\u2019s National Economic Recovery and Diversification Plan all is not lost\\u2026there\\u2019s hope. Our economy can be fixed. Our country needs the implementation of a strategic and systematic treatment protocol to pull us out of this critical illness they\\u2019ve inflicted on us. The first critical step is to have a plan. In keeping with its forward-thinking approach towards building an independent, self-reliant, resilient and confident society of the future, the UNC has working on a credible economic plan to regain fiscal balance, stabilize public debt, stop the bleeding of official reserves, and bring our economy back onto a growth trajectory. And the party I lead, the UNC, has the plan that can move us forward. Allow me to share the broad elements of our National Economy Recovery and Diversification Plan. We shall engage and implement the following: a. The Digital Economy b. The Innovation Culture c. The Entrepreneurship Impact d. The Diversification Strategy e. Good Governance f. Corporation Tax issues g. Job Creation h. State Enterprises 1) The Global Digital Economy I have articulated the need to adapt to the 4th Industrial Revolution and the Digital Economy as a means of achieving sustainability for future generations since as far back as 2010, when the UNC came to government under my leadership. The technological phenomenon of the Digital Age offers fantastic opportunities for growth and development of this country. In addition to the Digital Economy, I have also articulated the Blue, Green and Silver Economy as models for achieving these strategic economic objectives. Last year, 2017, it was estimated that spending in products and services in what is known as the Internet of Things alone would have been around the $2 trillion mark . The development of the Technology Sector to train our people to take advantage of all the opportunities are presenting themselves in this moment in time, but Keith Rowley administration knows nothing about creating they only know how to shut down and destroy. All of these strategies will be integrated with the Circular Economy as a model to augment the aforementioned mechanisms for achieving growth. The Circular Economy as the name suggests is a model that is an industrially regenerative system by design. \\u201cIt replaces the end-of-life concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy, eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse and return to the biosphere, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems and business models.\\u201d At its very core, the Circular Economy eliminates waste and recycles materials used in subtractive manufacturing, in addition to reducing the carbon footprint. 2) Prosperity through Innovation The future Trinidad & Tobago then under a UNC government will be built on a platform of sustainability, inclusive of values that promulgate a culture of tolerance, of peacefulness and happiness which were once our hallmark. This will create the environment required for innovation and creativity that celebrates our peoples own innate talents and abilities, and emerges the best in us, in a worthwhile way. Technological innovation is disrupting almost every sphere of human existence. Manufacturing is being disrupted with 3D Printing, which is also creating new opportunities for the Health Sector as work is underway across some major laboratories in tissue printing for kidneys. Transport delivery systems are being disrupted as drone technology is being perfected. Amazon\\u2019s drone technology, Prime Air, is presently being tested. Programming, re-programming, testing, piloting, repairs & Maintenance, and innovation to create unique brands are all real, new opportunities rapidly developing. These are just a few areas in the vast, uncharted galaxy of the Digital Age in the Internet of Things, other driverless vehicles, 3D clothes manufacturing and so on. I can spend all day going through this vast array of opportunities in the Digital Age. Augmented Reality will assist surgeons to see inside the human body, or protect workers operating in dangerous situations. Robotics, a combination of machine learning, algorithms, automation and coding all present opportunities in and of themselves. Quantum Computing will give the processing power of real-time, online information. Plasmonic materials are light controlled nano-materials which can be used to fight diseases like cancer. Electroceuticals to fight disease, and personalized medicine are just some of the innovations happening already. Are we grasping these opportunities? 3) Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship empowers people and enhances and develops economic growth. Under a UNC Government, Entrepreneurship in the Digital Age and Global Economy will be encouraged, fostered, nurtured and empowered by specific initiatives, programs and projects to accomplish the desired outcome of economic empowerment for all. The UNC will establish the policy framework for the prosperity of entrepreneurs in technology, manufacturing and other inbound and outbound logistics to ensure their development. 4) Diversification a) The Blue Economy The Blue Economy will encompass the utilization of our marine resources, with the establishment of standards, laws and regulations to ensure our country is surrounded by oceans that are clean and bountiful. Marine industries shall be developed to utilize these resources to provide sustainable jobs interwoven with innovation and technology driving growth and development, to preserve, protect and prosper the marine resources can also be harnessed in energy generation, food production and leisure, sports and entertainment intertwined in the Circular Economy. b) The Green Economy The Green Economy is of utmost importance to the environment, especially land-based assets and resources. Once again, global standards will be met, with the requisite laws and regulations for assurance and governance. Agriculture is of critical importance to the national security of this nation and the Green Economy will encompass this sector into the mainstream economic security of the country. c) The Green Energy Economy Alternative Renewable Energy is becoming a huge source of savings and wealth creation in many economies today. We have already seen how India, Denmark and Norway are engaging this as a productive sector. d) Agriculture My UNC Government will make agriculture a driver of our economic diversification strategy, continuing the work we started while in office to develop agriculture as a commercially viable business. We will give agriculture the budget it requires to help in our country\\u2019s economic transformation. We have singled out agriculture because of its potential contribution to the nation\\u2019s food and security needs, foreign exchange generation, deepening of sectoral linkages, management of the environment and fight against climate change. For agriculture to thrive and develop in Trinidad and Tobago it must become globally competitive, shifting away from primary agricultural commodities to higher value-added products. By focusing on agricultural commodities in which we have a distinct comparative advantage, it is quite possible for Trinidad and Tobago to capture a larger share of the global agricultural trade market and boost agriculture\\u2019s contribution to GDP and export earnings. We have several agricultural commodities where there is significant market opportunity and good growth potential. People are moving away from mega farms because they want to know where their food is coming from and how it is being grown. They are demanding organic \\u201csuperfoods\\u201d like turmeric, moringa, cocoa, avocado, gluten free flours like cassava flour and green banana flour. They are also demanding coconut water and other high value coconut products such as coconut milk, coconut butter, coconut sugar and are willing to pay premium prices for these products. We will also revitalize traditional agricultural industries such as sugar cane, cocoa, coffee and rice but using an agricultural cooperative model in which both state and farmers are owners of the agri-business. Unlike the Prime Minister who was recently quoted as saying \\u201cAgriculture will never be as commercially viable as Oil.\\u201d Is the Prime Minister trying to convince us that his intellectually vacuous Government is doing the right thing by keeping us trapped in the Oil and Gas cycle? e) Renewable Energy With countries turning more and more to renewable energy, this is a growth area in which Trinidad and Tobago needs to develop its capability and capacity. Such innovations provide scope for generating wealth and sustainable jobs for the future. This is especially important now since, according to world indices, Trinidad & Tobago consumes around 9.6 gigawatts of energy. Renewable energy generation will mean more oil and gas are available for export, thus adding to the value chain of the energy sector and becoming a huge source of savings and wealth creation. And therefore, the UNC\\u2019s plan is to protect this land and ensure that proper steps are taken to minimize the risks of climate change. 5) Job Creation We plan to designate the east-west corridor as a special growth pole. There is a highly educated and skilled workforce in place, they just need the jobs. Industries targeted are: \\u25cf Food processing and packaging (location \\u2013 Agri produce from South and East). \\u25cf Manufacture of basic medical supplies and disposables e.g. saline, needles, bandages, latex gloves, gowns etc. \\u25cf Manufacture of medical furniture (beds, trolleys, chairs). \\u25cf Manufacture of Office and School furniture. \\u25cf Manufacture of home furniture. \\u25cf Manufacture of specialist chemicals for the oil and gas industry and medical industry. \\u25cf Garment manufacturing \\u25cf Metals - Foundry for precision casting of primary component parts for use in secondary assembly industries. \\u25cf Glasswork for manufacture of panes, household glassware, optical lens and component parts for secondary assembly industries. \\u25cf Manufacture of simple household equipment \\u25cf Electronic assembly. \\u25cf E-waste recycling \\u2013 disassembly of computers, printers etc. to recover reusables. Countries actually pay you to do this and then you can resell the recovered metals. 6) Corporation Tax The UNC will implement a phased reduction in corporation tax over a five-year period to 20%. This will attract foreign investors, give a boost to small and medium manufacturers and increase investment in plant, equipment, efficient technology and research & development. It makes no sense to overtax our local businesses, taking money out of their pockets only to inefficiently try to return it in directed subsidies. The corporation tax on banks at 35% will remain in effect. Businesses know best where and how to allocate money for their own growth. Less government interference will only result in the improvement of our local businesses. Over the five-year period due to the phased basis, the impact on government revenues will be offset by increased jobs and increased productive capacity of our local businesses. Increased jobs will lead to a reduction in persons on the social service safety net and will result in saving to the Government. Increased productive capacity, although coupled with a lower tax rate, will result in larger revenues for the Government. In essence taxing at lower rate of a much larger economic pie as compared to taxing a higher rate of a smaller and declining economic pie. We have to enable our businesses to expand rather than taxing them into contraction. Local businesses are at a grave disadvantage at current taxation rates. Export capacity will only decrease as some of the large export markets we are targeting currently have lower taxation rates thus rendering T&T uncompetitive. Small and medium enterprises will grow faster at these new lower rates and new businesses owned by young entrepreneurs will be better able to get off the ground. 7) State Enterprise Sector Reform A main challenge to take command of the fortunes of our nation lies with reformation of the State Enterprise Sector. We recognize that there are truly committed employees who work in companies that are owned by taxpayers and a plan that ensures the long-term viability of these entities will benefit all stakeholders. Reform can follow the initially intended model which has been tried prior in our market, namely: \\u00b7 We start with creating a new entity, of course we would decide if we need to change the name \\u00b7 The reformation truly begins when we vest assets of the old enterprise in new entity giving them a clean slate. \\u00b7 The debts of the old company if any would be maintained in the old entity. \\u00b7 A Debt workout strategy would be followed thereafter. A debt workout strategy can include renegotiation of the terms and conditions of the debt, at times it can result in settlement of the debt for less than the face value if possible. \\u00b7 Capitalise new company upon consultation with best in class plant property and equipment guided by leading industry professionals. \\u00b7 Engage Private sector investors to partner with the state in the governance structure. This approach would result in the state remaining as a major player in all enterprises but ensuring benefit is obtained from the goal-oriented professionalism that would emerge from synergizing with private sector champions. The state retains ownership. \\u00b7 Mandate private sector investors and management to return a profit and deliver dividends. The people benefit from improved efficiency, business models designed around quality service delivery and divdends to the coffers of the state. Productivity based pay is one area that will definitely be a focus and would be achieved via consultation with Trade Unions and Private Sector Champions as to the best method to incorporate in job performance evaluations. This approach could be contemplated with Petrotrin as opposed to an outright SELLOUT of our national patrimony. Such an approach will not be taken however with: \\u00b7 essential services, such as are found in the arms of national security \\u00b7 With key utilities There are scores of state enterprises and many of them may be amenable to such a rationalization plan. From the State Enterprises Performance Monitoring Manual (2011) the quantum of State Enterprises are eighty (80): \\u00b7 44 - Wholly Owned Enterprises \\u00b7 7 \\u2013 Majority Owned Enterprises \\u00b7 3 \\u2013 Less than 50% State Ownership \\u00b7 26 \\u2013Indirectly owned as subsidiaries of State Enterprises 8) Petrotrin Madam Speaker, I have just learned that by letter dated today, October 5, 2018, titled \\u201cDistribution of Letters of Termination\\u201d, Petrotrin states, \\u201cBased on overwhelming feedback received during this week's employee communication sessions, the Interim Executive Transition Team has decided to accelerate the distribution of termination letters. The distribution of these letters will commence this morning. Employees within each of the respective groups will be advised of the location and time to collect their letters. Given the sensitive nature of this exercise, we kindly ask that everyone be at the Ballroom, PAP. Staff Club at the time specified for them to collect their letters. We want to remind all employees of the need to continue to observe the Policies of the Company, and in particular, those Policies that seek to protect the Company\\u2019s assets and its employees from misuse and abuse. Article F-Appropriate Workplace Behaviour states: \\u201cDishonest or illegal activities on company premises or while on company business will not be condone and can result in disciplinary action, including dismissal and criminal prosecution.\\u201d In this regard employees are encouraged to continue to preserve the assets and to consult our Policies for guidance. The non-observance of Policies could jeopardize the health, safety and well-being of other employees as well as Company property. Signed, Reynold Ajodhasingh Executive Director 2018 October 05\\u201d What a contemptuous and callous action by the company! a) Brief History Madam Speaker, Petrotrin has been the exclusive supplier of the energy which fuels our lives; from the LPG we cook with in the morning to the gasoline we need for our cars as well as a wide range of lubricants, fuels and feedstock from the downstream industries including medication, fertilizers and plastic and so much more. During research on this debate, I came across something that speaks to the legacy of the Pointe a Pierre refinery and indeed relevant to our future: What is not widely known is that the Pointe-a-Pierre refinery helped win a World War. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed the US base at Pearl Harbour\\u2026 George Beeby Thompson was appointed officer in charge of Trinidad\\u2019s operations, and the Department of Mines was mandated to organise the production of fuel for World War II. The refinery at Pointe-a-Pierre was then placed under military surveillance by both local and foreign security officials\\u2026. Wartime demands for refined petroleum products had to be increased, and a new refinery at Poine-a-Pierre was built in 1940. For security reasons the project was named 1234 and was started and completed in 14 months b) The Decision Petrotrin\\u2019s history makes it all the more difficult to accept the PNM Government\\u2019s mismanagement of Petrotrin. We\\u2019ve seen mismanagement of similar proportions with the Tobago Seabridge and now we are seeing it again with Petrotrin. In the end, people are suffering. We are worried that the situation being created will allow the PNM Government to sell the Petrotrin refinery at bargain basement prices to a preferred financier. The Public Procurement and Disposal of Property Act, 2015 is not fully proclaimed. I mean no disrespect or to draw the Office of the President into this debate, but I would like to indicate that because the Office of the Procurement Regulator falls under the Office of the President, I intend to write to her Excellency regarding this matter, specifically requesting her to exercise her power as the head of state to advise the Prime Minister to hold his hand on the sale of any Petrotrin assets until the Procurement Act is fully proclaimed. Over the past five weeks, the tens of thousands of people who rely on Petrotrin for their livelihood have woken up every day uncertain as to whether the Minister, Prime Minister or the Chairman would change the course of their lives with a fateful announcement on that day. So many contradictory statements have been made. Even the number affected has varied day by day between 1700 and 5000 persons. However, it is outrageous to suggest that only 5000 jobs would be affected by the closure of the refinery You see, no refinery would mean no transit through the neighboring towns and villages, thus no transport; the taxis supplying these workers may have to migrate to other areas. In certain areas businesses that are highly dependent on sales to Petrotrin employees may slow down. So, when the Prime Minister\\u2019s hand-picked chairman of Petrotrin can say; ALL, ALL, ALL in a dismissive manner, Each and every one of those ALL ALL ALL represents many more persons than just the one being fired. Between 30th August and 4th September2018, the Energy Chamber conducted a survey of 400 chamber member companies and of the companies responding, one third (1/3) indicated they expected to retrench workers due on the closing of the refinery. I have demanded the Environmental Management Authority (EMA) disclose whether or not a certificate of environmental clearance (CEC) has been granted for the decommissioning and/or closure of Petrotrin\\u2019s Pointe-a-Pierre refinery as is required by law. The closure of the Point-a-Pierre Refinery without satisfying the legal requirements of the Environmental Management Act can have catastrophic and cataclysmic effects on the environment that will last well into the future and cause irreparable loss and damage. This is a matter of great public importance which affects every citizen of our country and in those circumstances I look forward to the EMA\\u2019s response. Before I speak more about the refinery closure, it is important to figure out how we got here. c) How did we get here? \\u2013 Part 1 2005-2010 Problems encountered at Petrotrin are primarily the result of the corruption and mismanagement of the PNM over the years. The government is quick to tell you Petrotrin\\u2019s indebtedness: the US$850 million bullet payment to be made in 2019 and, the estimated US$250 Million to be fully paid by 2022 left on the US$750 Million bond. It is well documented that these debts are the result of the borrowings made during the last PNM government. They pursued a strategy of pumping large sums of borrowed money into refinery while allowing the Exploration and Production (E&P) part of the company to decline. This is why my administration focused on E&P development to bring back the industry. The records will show that between 2005 and 2010, a madness descended on Petrotrin and the result was a spending spree, the likes of which, this country had never seen. When the fete was over, we were left with: \\uf0a7 The ill-fated and scandalous World GTL project which ended with Petrotrin spending TT$3.15 Billion. \\uf0a7 The Gasoline Optimization Programme (GOP) increased from TT$2.45 billion in 2005 to TT$12.6 billion in 2013 when it was completed. \\uf0a7 The Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel Project rose from TT$791 million to TT $2.89 billion. \\uf0a7 The abandoned new headquarters which cost the citizens of this country more than TT$400 million dollars. \\uf0a7 A sharp decline in Trinmar\\u2019s production by one-third from 33,597 barrels per day in 2005 to 22,389 barrels per day in 2010. \\uf0a7 The two international bonds I mentioned for a collective US$1.6 billion. These projects cost the people of this country more than TT$18.5 billion dollars with $15 Billion in overruns. Could you imagine what could have been done with that $15 Billion? That last PNM administration left us quite a mess to clean up. Upon assuming office in 2010, I mandated that a strategic plan be implemented at Petrotrin to ensure that accountability and transparency were the foundation of any decision taken by the Board. I\\u2019ve already spoken about our focus on exploration and production. Let me fast forward to 2015 when they came into power. d) How did we get here? \\u2013 Part 2 2015-2018 Petrotrin has been through three management teams in the last three years. Just like the PATT, Petrotrin went through 3 chairmen in 3 years. With so many changes it is not surprising that the Government has been unable to develop and execute a consistent plan. It is noteworthy that under my watch just before the 2015 election, Petrotrin was able to source an un-secured loan for US$500 million from a consortium of eight international banks. The loan required no Government guarantee. This loan could have provided much needed capital to help maintain stability at Petrotrin. Once they assumed office, this measure was rejected by the PNM Government and this set the stage for future problems at Petrotrin. I have already spoken about their lack of effort in the area of E&P. Let me turn to what we have and have not been told regarding the refinery closure. e) The deceptions and falsehoods perpetrated by this government. The situation with Petrotrin has been difficult to assess given the amount of misinformation that has been put into the public domain by government actors. #1 - Petrotrin has paid no taxes and is a burden on the State - False. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (TTEITI) made clear that between 2010 and 2016 Petrotrin made payments in the sum of TT 20.2 Billion dollars. Payments were made as follows: \\u00b7 2011 - $3.6 Billion \\u00b7 2012 - $1.5 Billion \\u00b7 2013 - $4.2 Billion \\u00b7 2014 - $6.7 Billion \\u00b7 2015 - $4.1 Billion TTEITI has reported that the $4.1 Billion \\u201ccan be used to pay every pub\\u00adlic ser\\u00advant salary, pay for gate and meet the bud\\u00adget in the Min\\u00adistry of Agri\\u00adcul\\u00adture\\u201d. I call on the Minister of Finance to clearly state the amount of any payments made by Petrotrin to the government in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. I have documents which show that payments were made. #2 - The refinery has not made a profit - False The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are quick to tell the country that Petrotrin has continuously made a loss to justify their decision to shut down the refinery. This is just another con job\\u2026I mean Colm job\\u2026 At a Joint Select Committee in February of this year the Board told the country that Petrotrin generated a free cash flow of TT $1.8 Billion between the years 2013 and 2017. The 2017 audited financial statements showed a gross profit of $1.1 Billion. #3 - The company is close to insolvency! False Whilst the Prime Minister has publicly announced that Petrotrin in close to insolvency, the audited financial statements for the year ending 2017 show that his statement is untrue. #4 - How many going home? When the Prime Minister addressed the nation, he confirmed the number of affected workers would be about 1700. Since that time the Minister of Energy and Chairman of Petrotrin have stated various contradictory figures ranging from 2500 to 4700 over the past 5 weeks. At a meeting in El Dorado the Prime Minister admitted to imprecision and the inconsistency in the figures given for retrenchment at Petrotrin and responded that \\u201cthe numbers are not the issue\\u201d. It does not matter to the Prime Minister whether it is 1, 2, 3 or 5,000 persons who may lose their job. Official numbers show that 5,322 workers will be out of a job if the refinery is closed. The Union has estimated that an additional 3,500 workers are employed by contractors whose existence depends upon work from the Petrotrin refinery. It is astounding that in spite of not knowing how many persons would be affected, that the Government announced that it was taking action to close the refinery. Lie #5 - Will the refinery be sold? On 28th August 2018 the Petrotrin Chairman when asked if the refinery would be closed, his answer was \\u201cthat question does not even arise\\u201d. Five (5) days later, the Prime Minister offered the OWTU the first option to purchase the refinery. You would have thought if the Government was going to offer the refinery to OWTU for purchase that it would have done so long before its announcement of the refinery closure. So, what is the truth? #6 - What do the reports say? The Government, despite receiving world class advice as to how to move the company forward, decided instead to close the refinery. The reports spoke to refining various processes to improve Petrotrin, but did not recommend closing down the refinery. From the National Gas Master Plan which was commissioned under my Government to the Lashley Report to the Solomon Report, all concluded that Petrotrin had a way forward. Not one Report recommended that the refinery be closed. I call on the Government to make public the various reports considered by the Board of Petrotrin and/or the Cabinet in making the decision to close the refinery. I further call on the government to say where the recommendation to close the refinery came from. Petrotrin would have to be closed Why would they try so hard to mislead the public??? Because the ensuing legal matter of Fake Oil and A&V drilling has direct implications for a sitting Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and PNM operatives who are allegedly implicated in a massive debacle of corruption of Millions of dollars from Petrotrin. They would have to close Petrotrin to ensure that no records would be found and no witnesses could come forward to testify. Where do we go from here? I spoke about the history of Petrotrin under the last PNM administration to highlight the difference between our parties and our governments. We took a failing Petrotrin and turned it around into a success story. The PNM Government took a profitable Petrotrin which was making tax payments and ran it into the ground. In less than one month, the tens of thousands whose livelihoods depend on Petrotrin will be in jeopardy. The effects of the closure of the Point-a-Pierre refinery will have a contagion effect on the South and Central communities and the entire financial system and, the damage will be irreparable. Where will families turn and to whom will they turn when their mortgages have to be paid? How will parents tell their children that they can no longer send them to school or university? How will contractors face their workers when they can no longer sustain their employment? What explanation will businesses give to their creditors when their debts become due and their income is no more? This government has proven that it is not prepared to listen to the people, the Union or the experts. They are intent in selling out the assets of our country to a chosen few. This will be the greatest loss to our future generations and as a people we ought not to allow this to happen. Countless times, the PNM has been voted out of Government for this very same behaviour- greed, corruption, bonding and debting us back into slavery to colonial entities. And each time we on this side, step in and pick up the pieces, mending the economy, creating opportunities where they left none and bringing hope back to a weary and worn citizenry. It is now instructive that the PNM will never occupy Government again, the polls are coming in, their own political pundits and advisers are telling them the same: the people want you out. So, what do they decide to do, they mash up, destroy and obliterate everything good in Trinidad and Tobago. What they think is that we will not be able to fix it and as they laugh down on us once more, they can run off to enjoy the spoils of this perverse feast. Let me assure you, firstly, we will not stand back and allow the PNM to destroy our country, when I speak I speak with the authority of not just hundreds of thousands who voted against you in 2015, but the thousands more who have since come over to us. And even with the worst of the damages that you can do, let me assure you that I will once again lead a Government with the experience, the innovation, the intelligence and the heart for the people to work with them to overcome this dark period in our history. Neither history nor the citizens will vindicate you. This country will not forgive you. With all the voices on the Opposition bench, with the trade unions, the workers, the men and women on the street, the children in schools, I call on this Government: You must not close the Refinery You must look to other solutions You must keep our Energy sector and preserve our energy security You must preserve Jobs and retain our lands You must not sell out our assets You will not be allowed to destroy our legacy in the Petroleum sector, You will not be allowed to sell out our Patrimony, You will no longer be allowed to abuse our citizens each and every day. We will fight you in here, we will oppose you in Public and we will take you to the courts and we will win. PNM Performance \\u201cVISION 2030\\u201d The Government for the very first time, after more than three years in office and faced by an anxious population demanding to hear what has the Rowley administration achieved in three years after spending over $160 billion dollars, incidentally, almost $5 billion more than my administration in the comparative time, the government produces a budget document called Vision 2030 Reporting on Progress 2015-18. I pray to God that no one was paid for this and it was a free offering from well-meaning PNM activists. To begin with this document is produced as at September 2018 and purports to give comparative data for 2018. How in the world can you assess your achievements even before the year is completed? When one examines the data, it is unhelpful to draw conclusions of any kind. I note that in the previous incarnation of the PNM they would have relied on their policy as Vision 2020, but this PNM Government has now laid Vision 2030. I am told that when someone has Vision 2030 eyesight is worse than average. It seems that this PNM Government is visionless! They have underperformed in every Ministry and in every sector by their own admission. The PNM has judged themselves and after three years in office they have by their own admission exposed their own failures and non-performance. a) Housing When I opened this Vision 2030 document I really thought that it was a joke. Every single indicator in the housing sector is \\u201cto be determined\\u201d. TBD. In three years, with five Housing Ministers, including Diego Martin West, the Prime Minister, if you cannot account for how many houses you inherited or distributed, then something is terribly wrong. I don\\u2019t want to be discourteous to the Minister of Housing but we all know that he knows a lot about housing apartments. This PNM Government is unable to say how many housing units have been completed, how many have been distributed, how many loans have been granted for citizens to purchase houses or how many grants were disbursed. All of that is \\u201cto be determined.\\u201d They are unable to account for any of these things because they have done nothing! Not a single new home was constructed under this wicked PNM Government. The Minister of Finance told us that there are over 176,000 applicants who need houses in Trinidad and Tobago, yet this uncaring Government fails to provide basic housing for our citizens. After three years, the data suggest that they have not started and completed a single house on a new housing site not designed or developed by either my administration or that of Prime Minister Manning before me. b) Education The Vision 2030 document told us that Trinidad and Tobago ranked 48 out of 137 under Pillar 4- Health and Primary Education on the Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, I was very happy when I saw this. However, when I looked at the Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018 myself to fact check this, I saw Trinidad and Tobago ranked 60. I really hope that this is a typo because I would not like to believe that Government is misleading or fabricating statistics to suit them, otherwise that will be tantamount to conmanship! It shows that anything this Government tells us we cannot believe it, this is a Government we cannot trust. They have done nothing for primary, secondary or tertiary education. Through the incompetence of this Government, schools remain closed since school has been reopened for the term, children have to flush toilets with buckets, many of our nation\\u2019s schools are in a state of disrepair and not enough is being done to curtail the high levels of school violence. When you look at the Vision 2030 document the numbers of students that benefitted from GATE in 2017 was 29,492, now the figure stands at 17,924 students. What this means is that this wicked Government has shut the GATE and displaced 11,568 students from attaining a tertiary level education. Their achievement in tertiary is to disqualify and disenfranchise 11,568 students, something that they are so proud of that they printed it in their book of achievements. c) Health Every year the Minister stands up and tells us how many hospitals he is going to build, it is a throwback to each budget when we hear about the Arima Hospital and the Point Fortin Hospital. There is a need for more hospital beds, we hear the cries of the hundreds of families who have to wait days for a hospital bed at the nation\\u2019s hospital. By their own admission in this Vision 2030 document nothing has been done to alleviate this problem of provision of hospital beds. This cruel and heartless government blatantly refuses to open the Couva Children\\u2019s Hospital and play politics with the lives of our nation\\u2019s children. I call upon them to open the Couva Children\\u2019s Hospital! This can add up to 230 beds to the current hospital bed shortage. d) Public Safety and Security On the homicide detection rate, this Government does not have a target rate that they will like to achieve. It shows that they have no plans and no target. Then the Government to make themselves look good placed their target of the crime detection rate for serious recorded crimes as 35%! This is simply unbelievable as the Government is setting a low target so that it can be easily achieved to measure their performance. They are being deceptive with the statistics. This 1% increase in the detection rate for murder is negligible by itself had it not been laughable. e) Foreign Relations Again, it seems that the Government is in a state of delusion and hysteria, where they highlight as one of their achievements in improving foreign relations is, ironically, reducing the number of overseas missions instead of creating more. f) Transport System It is incredulous for this PNM Government to state that only 2.7km of road was constructed in 2015. It was under my tenure that there were no amounts of protest for bad roads as we are seeing now. Villages feel neglected that the Government isn\\u2019t paying attention to their needs so they channel their frustration by burning tires and blocking roads in begging this Government for assistance. In one year alone my Government was able to pave 1,100 roads! That is performance not the incompetence of this Government. During our pre-budget consultations with the people, the conditions of roads was the issue that most persons complained of. I can all hundreds of roads that are dilapidated and falling apart just like this Government. g) Public Utilities Had it not been for my Government there would have been many villages, communities and homes without pipe borne water. The Government stated that in 2015, 93.6% of the population had piped access of water to their homes. This was an achievement of my Government! They have admitted that there has been no progress or any work to increase the supply of water to the homes of citizens in Trinidad and Tobago. h) Fiscal Balance The Minister of Finance promised a balanced budget at minimum by fiscal year 2018, well, fiscal year 2018 has come and gone and yet the Minister has failed to balance the budget. When one looks at the achievement booklet of the Government you will see that there is no target, nothing was done, there is no plan to balance the budget. The Government is admitting to its failure! They are using this Vision 2030 document in an attempt to blind the people of our country. This book is no vision 2030 but a TBD vision!! MOF Budget 2019 Promises and Falsehood \\\"marginal job loss, full employment in TT\\\". Yet in the government\\u2019s own books, over 35,000 have lost their jobs under the PNM. Indeed, it is far more than this. Total Employment at Q2 2015 stood at 628,600 and in Q3 2017, Total Unemployment was at 602,000. Approx 27,000 jobs lost. These statistics are based on July 2018 CBTT Economic Bulletin July 2018. \\\"we have the best healthcare here\\\". Yet there is no medication in the hospitals,no CDAP drugs in the health centres no beds, and children are being denied lifesaving surgery. \\u201cwe will take care of the disabled\\u201d. Yet for the past three years the CARLSEN Field Disability Centre remains shutdown by the PNM after the PP constructed it in 2015 to assist over 20,000 disabled men, women and children. \\u201cgas price increase will benefit the poor\\u201d. Yet Taxi fares have increased, there is no alternative mode of public transportation and 60% of vehicles use super. \\\"the manufacturing sector in the non-energy area grew by 7.8%\\\". Yet the IMF and TTMA has no record of this and MOF could not explain how. \\\"health centres will be opened 24hrs\\\". Yet under the People\\u2019s Partnership 2010-2015 health centres were opened for extended hours and when the PNM came in they stopped this. \\\"we will add $100 value to your TT food cards\\\". Yet they boasted about removing 18,000 people from the card 4 months ago. \\\"procurement legislation is important to us\\\". Yet they are buying four boats for over 1.2 billion dollars without proper procurement just by PM visiting a ship yard in Australia. \\\" we believe in the thrust for information technology through our schools\\\". Yet they have removed the laptop program where children benefited individually, they also promised free broad band throughout the country. Instead they placed broadband on a PTSC bus that drove up and down the highway. \\\" we will move towards removing the fuel subsidy as a priority\\\". Yet not a word on any plan to increase the efficiency of public transport. \\\"we are proud our athletes have medaled and done very well on the international circuit\\\". Yet in 2017 and 2019 several athletes publicly disassociated themselves from the gov\\u2019t due to lack of funding, citing that gov\\u2019t had played no role in their success. \\\"we will continue our thrust to improve in agriculture\\\". Yet packaging and processing facilities remain abandoned which were constructed by the People\\u2019s Partnership for agriculture. \\\"we will use drones in the fight against crime\\\". Yet the police lament that they do not have vehicles and the bandits and murderers have far superior weapons than the police. \\\"Maracas bay has been developed\\\". Yet raw sewage and filth is what greets visitors right now on their way to get a bake and shark in Maracas. That is a snapshot of what the real Trinidad and Tobago looks like today under three years of the PNM and 4 budgets later having spent over 160 billion dollars. This is the real Trinidad and Tobago, not the fantasy island that the Minister and colleagues seem to be living on. FISCAL MEASURES a) Importation of Diesel and Fuel Super is the main fuel On the price increase to Super fuel by $1 per litre, the Minister was flippant when he stated; \\u201c\\u2026 the cost of public transportation\\u2026 will not be unduly affected.\\u201d However, based on sales figures from National Petroleum (NP) in the twelve months from March 2017 to March 2018 the volume of super sold was roughly 516 million litres vs roughly 23 million litres sold of Premium. This means that 96% of drivers use Super versus Premium and Super usage exceeds diesel by 100 million litres. This means the average citizen who depends on taxi drivers to visit the hospital, go to the market, travel to work and school will face price increases. When you raise the price of gasoline practically the cost of everything else rises in T&T. b) Short Term Memory I would like to know the reason for a change of heart by the Honourable Minister with respect to the removal of the fuel subsidy \\u2013 especially during such harsh economic times? If I may jog the apparent short-term memory of the Minister of Finance, let us return to Hansard of Monday 8th October, 2012. During the debate on the Appropriation Bill, 2012, the Member for Diego Martin North East said: \\u201cThe petroleum subsidy was put in for a reason. It was put in to protect people, to help them to deal with the high cost of petroleum products. There are very few countries in the world that have a petroleum levy Act... They do comparisons to other countries. \\u2026but they do not tell you that none of those countries has a Petroleum Production Levy and Subsidy Act where the oil companies are taxed on behalf of the people in order to reduce the cost of petroleum products.\\u201d These are not my words. These are the words of the Member for Diego Martin North East, now Minister of Finance just a few years ago when he sat on this side of this chamber. \\u201cOh, what a tangled web they weave!\\u201d National Security Madam Speaker, as I conclude I wish to share some of our plans with regard to safety and security. The desperate cry of our people no matter where you live in our country today, rich or poor, employed or unemployed, whether you are Indo Trinidadian, Afro Trinidadian, Syrian, White, Chinese or Lebanese, is to be safe and secure. After three (3) years of this government and having spent more than 24 Billion Dollars on National Security and proposing to spend another 6 Billion in fiscal 2018-2019 our country is more unsafe now than it ever has been before. Where are we now? It is important for me to outline to the country where we are in terms of the extent of the criminality that our country faces as we speak. The figures that I am quoting are taken from the Commissioner of Police\\u2019s report for the week ending September 29th 2018. These figures are compiled by the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service on a weekly basis. \\u25cf In the life of this administration more than 1500 persons have been murdered. \\u25cf For this year more than 400 persons have been murdered. \\u25cf There has been 34 more murders this year compared to the same period last year. \\u25cf There has been 121 more reported cases of rape, incent and other sexual offences. \\u25cf Serious indecency has increased over last year\\u2019s figures by 93% \\u25cf There has been a 23 % increase in kidnapping and a 60% increase in kidnapping for ransom. \\u25cf There has been 198 more reported robberies in 2018 than in 2017 over the same period. \\u25cf There has been 92 more reported cases of possession of firearms and ammunition in 2018 than the same period in 2017. What this represents is a state of criminality, terror and fear that the people of our country face on a daily basis after three (3) years of this government. a) Broken Promises They have repeated their promises Where is their ten point plan? This government has come to the Parliament year after year for the past three (3) years and has disrespected the intelligence of the people of our country by making promise after promise with absolutely no intention of delivering. On behalf of the people of our country I want to ask this government a few questions regarding national security. \\u25cf What is the status of the Board Protection Agency? \\u25cf What is the status of the Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES) system that you promised the country more than two (2) years ago that you have not implemented? \\u25cf What is the status of the system for electronic monitoring that you have been promising the country for more then three (3) years? \\u25cf What is the status of the Offender Management Programme that you promised the country in the last budget? \\u25cf What improvements have you made to the witness protection programme? \\u25cf What improvements have you made to improve the facilities at the Forensic Science Centre? The answer to each of these questions is that you have done nothing. You have delivered on nothing. You and your government continue year after year to break the promises that you have made to the people of our country? b) The Anti-Gang Legislation This government\\u2019s big ticket item for the last year to fight crime has been the enactment and proclamation of the Anti-Gang Legislation. They said 80% of the murders that were committed were gang related and the passage of this legislation would give the police the ability to go after those involved in gang activity. It has now been four (4) months since the proclamation of the Anti-Gang Act 2018 and there has not been a single arrest, charge or prosecution of any person under the provisions of this legislation. This Opposition gave the government the required constitutional support for the passage of this legislation into law but their incompetence and ineptitude has once again been revealed by their inability to effectively operationalize this legislation to combat the gangs in our country. Let me repeat since this legislation has been proclaimed here have been 170 murders. In the proposals for fiscal 2018-2019 there is not a single word on addressing the issue of criminal gangs. Minister Young in the Anti-Gang debate told the country, \\u201cThis is legislation that the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service and other law enforcement agencies are screaming, begging and pleading with us to bring to the Parliament\\u201d. This same Minister said two (2) days ago that there is a drop in the murder rate. I don\\u2019t know where he is living. We have now past 400 murders for the year and we have three (3) months to go. This week the life of prison officer Wayne Jackson was snuffed out. A man who gave 30 years of his life to the people of our country. Where is the SSA? Where is the intelligence that you boasted about? Proposals for 2018-2019 No money in the budget for it. The big ticket item announced by the Minister of Finance with respect to national security was the establishment of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service Operational Command Centre. This is simply another name for what was established during the period 2010 -2015 and known as the National Operations Centre. If there is one thing that the Minister succeeded in his three (3) hour presentation was to demonstrate during the three (3) hour presentation was that he proved beyond a doubt that this government was bereft of any ideas and when all else fails they will simply copy what they saw as a success in 2010-2015 and find a new name for it and take the credit. Their next big ticket item is that they are going to improve the Emergency Call Center so when you call you would not have to wait long and you won\\u2019t get a busy tone. How is this measure going to prevent crime? If a crime occurs yes you want to be able to get an answer when you call 990 or 999. This is yet another reactionary measure by this government. The people of this country want measures put in place so that they don\\u2019t have to make that desperate call. The Minister of Finance seems to think the answer to the criminality that our country faces is to change the uniform of the Police Service. We do NOT need a change of uniform but a change of government!!!! Let me remind you that during the period 2010-2015 my government was able to bring serious crime down to the lowest in 32 years by making law enforcement more present and giving them the resources to be more present. During that period of time:- Today I want to tell this country that when my party returns to government no Opposition will prevent us from ensuring that the police, army and regiment will be ever present on the streets and throughout our country to protect the people of our country. c) GPS Vehicle Tracking The Minister of Finance announced a number of measures that this government proposes to implement in the coming year. The first of those measure announced was the TTPS would be using global positioning system (GPS) for vehicle tracking. I would like to inform the Minister and this government, that as at 2014 ALL Trinidad and Tobago Police Service vehicles had been equipped with GPS Technology. That was in an effort to improve police response to calls for service. As at March 2014, 594 vehicles had been outfitted. The Minister of finance is not aware that what he is proposing already exists such is the incompetence of this government. Many proposals made but where are the allocations. The Minister of Finance has made a number of proposals for improving the national security apparatus. Let me outline some of these proposals:- \\u25cf Dashboard cameras \\u25cf Body cameras \\u25cf Laptops and tablets for all police vehicles \\u25cf Computerization of all police stations \\u25cf Body cameras This would not be implemented, given their track record. What I would do when we return to government? Clearly, we must move beyond police station, smart phones and uniforms into the deeper social and psychological dimension to crime fighting which entails rebuilding villages and communities. The UNC\\u2019s philosophy is that we will invest in the people, and community by community we will build the nation. Extra emphasis and resources must be placed on rebuilding trust between law enforcement and the village. There was a time when the police officer was known to the village, had their respect, even fear, and integrated with community members as a mentor, elder and disciplinarian. He even had a place of pride in the village. Today this is sadly no more. We propose the introduction of Community and Village Co-ordination Officers program where by officers return to walk and talk with members of their communities. This will serve not only for purposes of intelligence gathering and crime detection but for building trust with the communities they serve. This will be integrated with the technology backbone to ensure that there is a two-way flow of communication between the police and citizens using various social media platforms. We believe that a fundamental principle of modern policing is that policing is a two-way street and \\u201ccitizens are more likely to listen if they are heard.\\u201d A common thread you would find running through all our plans is education and training. Invest, invest, invest\\u2026in our people! We will allocate part of campus at UWI Debe for training of our protective services, doubling as a faculty for both the public and training of the protective services: \\u00a7 Certificate \\u00a7 Diploma \\u00a7 Degree \\u00a7 Degree in Policing \\u00a7 Post Graduate degree for Protective Services This will allow our service men and women to build sustainable and fulfilling careers while they perform a duty to our nation. Integrating this facility into protective services training. All members of Protective services should at least have a certificate level qualification before entering service. Witness protection programme The witness protection programme will be properly resourced and the Justice Protection Act would be repealed and replaced to bring into law provisions to operationalize the relationship between our country and our Caribbean and international partners to provide adequate and proper protection to persons and their families who assist in law enforcement. Forensic science center The Forensic Science Center will be properly resourced and private institutions both local and international will be used to clear the backlog of cases that presently exist at the Forensic Science Center. This will provide in a real time manner he evidence they need to prosecute persons who are before the court. We would further allocate part of this campus for training in forensics and for a forensic lab. Bring legislation to wipe out corruption in the protective services and a special Court to deal with corruption in the public service. Protection for victims of domestic violence. I will ensure that the domestic violence act which is presently no providing the protection need for victims of domestic violence be repealed and replaced by a much stronger piece of legislation. A special unit of the Trinidad and Tobago police service will be established to address specifically complaints of domestic violence and to provide protection to those persons in positions of danger in their domestic environment. Special powers will be provided to these officers to specifically address the special need of these victims and to remove persons who are a threat to their safety and security and that of their children. A community based approach We will implement a deeper policy and program that targets crime prevention and community engagement. We will seek to initiate a major cultural change where we move the police from a command and control \\\"warrior\\\" mindset to a \\\"partner and guardian\\\" of the people mindset. The aim is to develop mutual respect between the police and the community. The social media platforms can assist to being the community closer to the police. Ensure that all vacancies in the protective services and customs and excise be filled permanently. We will operationalize the naval assets of our country throughout the borders of our country. The protective services of our country, police, army and regiment will be deployed throughout the entire country to have a 24 hour presence of law enforcement throughout the country. Parole system -Special legislation will be enacted to bring into existence a parole system in the prison system and first-time legislation will be enacted to give the power to reduce sentences of persons who provide information to law enforcement that leads to the apprehension of persons involved in specific offences. We did it before and we will do it again? I have a team that will bring down crime. That team will bring together all of the agencies of the State to fight and take back our country from the criminal element. They will work with law enforcement to go after the criminal element, seek out and bring to justice those who break the law and terrorize our citizens. For those that are charged and brought before the Court Justice will be swift and absolute. My government will return our Trinidad and Tobago to the place we know it to be where the hardworking persons will enjoy the resources that we are gifted. CONCLUSION Anyone who looked or listened to the Minister\\u2019s speech on Monday knows that the turnaround he speaks about is not real - it cannot be felt, it cannot be seen, it cannot be touched, it cannot be smelt and it cannot be tasted. There has been no turnaround of empty pockets, no turnaround of empty kitchen cupboards, no turnaround of empty wallets, no turnaround of job loss. There has not even been a turnaround of the lackluster performance from government. This government has spent the last three years and four budgets campaigning for the next election. The Prime Minister tells us that he is not afraid to lose the next election. In the same breath, he says that Balisier house is run better than the PNM government. I think everyone will agree with me that anything and everything is being run better than this government. No amount of bravado or strong man politics can change the reality that citizens cannot afford to buy school books for their children, they cannot afford to put bread and johnny bake on the table. Citizens are fed up of the blame, of the excuses, and they are completely fed up of the PNM. Their strategy is not to fix the economy, not to help the small man, not to create jobs, not to uplift the country. Their strategy is to stay in power and to keep enjoying luxury yachts, golf trips and mustangs. They do not know or care about the pain that you feel; they do not understand the hardship that you face. I have told you before no one will control me. I am not for sale. I am for all the people of Trinidad and Tobago and everywhere I hear the same there has been no turn around. Instead of a turn around all we get from this government is a run around. This is not the turnaround government this is the run around government They run you in circles, they blame Kamla, blame the police, blame the public servants, the teacher, unions, economists and lord knows who they will blame next. For three years later and four budgets all the people of this country have gotten from you is excuses and a run around. This is the tragic and frightening crossroads we find ourselves today\\u2014a Government destabilising every single sector, destroying our citizens\\u2019 peace of mind, their livelihood, taking away their democratic rights and protections. This Government has willingly breached its social contract with the people who elected them in good faith to serve their basic needs and rights to live in a stable, progressive democracy. My fellow citizens have been repaid with betrayal, treachery, brutality, ingratitude and inhumanity by this Government of heartless, dangerous incompetence and hate. When the Honourable Member for Diego Martin North East ended with a song from a foreign, not local, performer, it was not exactly reflective of this reality of the citizens of this country, so I will instead offer him the song he should have really ended with. And that is one by former soca monarch VOICE Tell dem ah doh need no strap to defend my people from wicked and evil way So sit down, rock back, big man look for a wuk Yuh too damn evil If they destroy my people then DEN FIRE GO BUN DEM! My fellow country men and women, I speak directly to you. If you are really looking for a turnaround in this country, I say to you turn your face to the rising sun, let the shadows fall behind you. The shadows of darkness, despair, destruction, wickedness and hardship inflicted by the PNM. It is time to step out of the shadows of big business, elitism, crumbs and a government that continues to take you and your vote for granted. Original quote by anonymous: if you want to turn things around, turn your face to the sun and let the shadows fall behind you. But I expect the response of the Honourable Prime Minister to be the same one he has consistently given when we confront him with questions of alleged corruption in the Petrotrin shutdown and other deals\\u2014I expect him to say \\u201cMeet me outside on the Pavement.\\u201d Threats, evasion and bullying, betrayal and ingratitude are all hallmarks of a coward, so nobody is intimidated by your empty threats. I am a civilized leader, a leader that demonstrates compassion and strength through what I do, not just what I SAY. THEREFORE meet me not on the pavement but on the campaign trail, today, this very second, we are ready and waiting for! Meet us on the hustings, where I am sure you will continue your strange, rants about biscuit politics while we raise the bread and butter issues. As I was walking to the parliament on Monday I saw an elderly man and his grandson holding a placard and today I will use the words on that placard to end my contribution. As I told you before I stand by the people I stand for the people and I stand with the people Today I will give voice to what was said on that placard and what is on the minds of every right- thinking citizen of this country. Madam I quote \\u201cwe will riot with we fingers come 2020 or before\\u201d I say to you, call the elections now and Meet the people the Voting Booths!! Madame Speaker I thank you\\u2026.

COME September when the new school year opens, if negotiations for revised salaries for teachers has not commenced there may be empty classrooms. This from Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers\\u2019 Association Lynsley Doodhai as he addressed the crowds at Labour Day celebrations at Avocat Junction, Fyzabad yesterday. Doodhai said that teachers were receiving 2014 salaries, and were getting \\u201cimpatient, restless, frustrated and angry\\u201d. He said that TTUTA had attempted many times to kick start negotiation for a new collective agreement for the period 2014-2017 to the Chief Personal Officer of the Ministry of Education but there has been little success. \\u201cAlmost three years later, TTUTA continues to wait on the CPO to respond to our proposals. In that time food prices have increased, prices on motor vehicles have increased at least three times, and transportation has become more costly. The cost of living has risen while our standard of living has plummeted. Teachers are working at 2014 salaries. I want to let the Government know that almost three years of waiting teachers are getting impatient, restless, frustrated and getting angry. They have been signalling their discontent to the association for some time now to the association and we are calling for action\\u201d, said Doodhai. He said Minister of Finance Colm Imbert had said after the mid-year review of budget said the country has turned a corner. \\u201cIf that is indeed so then TTUTA is demanding that the Government issue the appropriate instructions to the CPO to begin negotiations\\u201d, said Doodhai. He said that TTUTA met in emergency council last Thursday. \\u201cIf negotiations do not commence by September, then in new school year will see teachers taking things into their own hands. I forewarn that you will see class rooms without teachers from September\\u201d, said the TTUTA president. He added that retired teachers were also suffering, with some having to wait as much as three years and more to collect their dues and surviving on an NIS contribution of $3000 per month. Doodhai said the Minister of Education was \\u201ca damn good TTUTA president, but he is a damn failure as a Minister of Education\\\". \\u201cFrom Gopeesingh to Garcia all we got was exchange. Our students and teachers continue to occupy schools with health and asafety issues. Our schools lack basic supplies like toilet paper, white board markers and cleaning materials. Our teachers who are graduates of universities cannot be upgraded, caterers not paid, maxi taxi drivers who transport cannot get paid, our school supervisors cannot get their travelling. If you listen to the Minister of Education you would swear we have the best education system in the world. I call on Garcia to stop the lies. It is time to start dealing with the real issues in the education system. Comrades, do not think for one minute that teachers are a priviledged group and are not affected by issues. We are just like any other worker in the country\\u201c, said Doodhai.

Prime Minister Andrew Holness (second from left) on a tour of the new power plant in St. Catherine (JIS Photo). Image via Cana News, 22 August 2018. KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug 22, CMC \\u2013 The Jamaica government says the construction of a multi-million dollar power plant in St. Catherine, southeast of the capital could provide the impetus for increased local and foreign direct investment into the country. \\u201cIt sends a very good signal to the international community about the state of the Jamaican economy to not just sustain the financing of such a large project but to also have all the necessary support, infrastructure and facilities in place to ensure that such a large investment can go off seamlessly,\\u201d said Prime Minister Andrew Holness. The 190 megawatt (MW) power plant being constructed by the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) is estimated to cost US$330 million and is being financed by largely by local investors. Holness said that this augurs well for Brand Jamaica, and anticipates that \\u201cwe will be seeing (more) large projects of this nature in the future. \\u201cInvestors can rest assured that they can calculate and manage their risks in Jamaica, that the Jamaican Government is supportive of these large investments and that we have the labour force to support (them),\\u201d he added. Holness told reporters that the development, which is two months ahead of schedule and within budget, is a major achievement for Jamaica, as not only will it ensure the country\\u2019s energy security, \\u201cbut for the average consumer, it will inevitably see a reduction in your electricity prices. \\u201cI am also happy to know that the plant itself is far more environmentally (friendly) in its design, in that the particulate discharge will be far less than the old plant and that this is a combined cycle plan\\u2026 so you\\u2019re getting far more energy out of every unit of fuel that you use,\\u201d he said. Golding said he is also pleased that the project has provided employment for a number of locals, noting that it was \\u201cheart-warming to see the many Jamaicans coming to work. \\u201cThese kinds of infrastructure projects, though they use quite a bit of foreign exchange, generate significant employment, and just interacting with the labour force on the site here, tells me that the management of the construction here and JPS, have taken all the necessary measures to ensure that there is industrial harmony on the site and that there is some amount of human resource development taking place,\\u201d he noted. JPS President and Chief Executive Officer, Emanuel DaRosa, said the company is \\u201cvery proud of what we have accomplished at this point. \\u201cThis is a major undertaking\\u2026 for JPS and there are some significant benefits that are going to flow out of this project for the people of Jamaica,\\u201d he said.

Nicholas Habib leaves the San Fernando High Court yesterday after he was sentenced to seven years in prison for the 2005 murder of Gerald Bocus .Photo:TREVOR WATSON A murder accused who was a teenager when he shot and killed a man during a robbery at a bar in 2005 will spend the next seven years and seven months in prison for the crime. Justice Hayden St Clair-Douglas started with a possible sentence of 30 years but given the length of time Nicholas Habib already spent in jail and his guilty plea, he will spend just over seven and half years doing hard labour. Last October Habib pleaded guilty to murder on the basis of the murder felony rule which applies in circumstances where a killing occurred during the commission of an arrestable offence \\u2013 in this case a robbery. On October 10, 2005 group of friends including law enforcement officers, were at a bar on Coffee Street, San Fernando when Habib and others entered and announced a hold up. Gerald Bocus a patron at the bar was shot. He died at the bar. Habib, who was 18-years-old at the time, was charged with murder. He also faced charges of wounding with intent against Nigel Cowan, robbery with aggravation after Cowan\\u2019s $600 cellular phone, $40 wallet, $10 identification card and $40 were taken and that being armed with a firearm he assault Nigel Cowan with intent to rob. Before the San Fernando Second Criminal Court, St Clair-Douglas considered the aggravating and mitigating factors surrounding the offence and noted that although the probation officer\\u2019s report on Habib stated that he was lacking in empathy, guilt and remorse and fails to accept culpability for his actions, there was no reason to alter the 30 year starting point for the sentence. The aggravating and mitigating factors for the offender was explored. St Clair-Douglas said these included Habib\\u2019s age at the time, that the offence was unplanned and that Bocus was shot and killed. The judge deducted one-third of the sentence for Habib\\u2019s guilty plea and the 12 years and five months Habib he spent in prison from October 26 2005. He will serve aremainder of seven years and seven months hard labour for Bocus\\u2019s murder. For the wounding with intent charge against Cowan, Habib was sentenced to seven years. Six year sentences were passed on each of the charges of robbery with aggravation and assault with intent to rob. These the judge said, would have already been served by Habib.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"Four years before two international journalists were arrested, prosecuted and convicted this week in Myanmar for obtaining sensitive information to serve the public interest, four journalists and their boss were jailed for ten years with hard labour for trespassing and violating the same colonial-era Official Secrets Act. Intimidation of journalists and attacks on a free press frequently build incrementally as officials activate state arrangements to protect secrets and prevent public scrutiny. The fate of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should concern us all. Formerly Burma, Myanmar had lifted hopes that it would join the international fold of democracy with the elevation within the government of activist Aung San Suu Kyi. Her government now stands accused of allowing the genocide of Rohingya Muslims and attacking journalists who expose military atrocities against the stateless community. At the time of their arrest, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were pursing leads in the deaths of ten Rohingya villagers during an army crackdown in Rakhine. They were found guilty under Section 3.1 (c) of the Act, which covers obtaining secret official documentation that \\u201cmight be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy\\u201d and sentenced on Monday to seven years in jail. The duo had published a story on the massacre via Reuters on February 8; their work prompted international calls for a credible probe of the killings. Their story and photographs provided the first independent confirmation of what occurred in Rakhine. Two of their photos showed the men kneeling, in one with their hands behind their necks and in a second with their hands tied behind their backs. A third picture shows their bodies in a blood-stained, shallow grave. The case against the journalists contained significant gaps: a prosecution witness testified the \\u201csecret\\u201d documents were planted on the reporters, a police officer admitted he burned his notes from the time of the reporters\\u2019 arrest, a police major said the \\u201csecret documents\\u201d found on the reporters were actually not secret and outside the court the military admitted to the Rakhine massacre. Far from Trinidad and Tobago, the fate of these journalists\\u2014and too many others\\u2014draws this newspaper\\u2019s unreserved condemnation and raises warnings for the community of news media workers here and in the region who have consistently resisted attempts by several governments to limit freedom of the press. We again insist that the criminal exposure of journalists in Trinidad and Tobago in the 167-year-old Libel and Defamation Act must be repealed. The fate of our colleagues in Myanmar illustrates the dangers of protecting those laws that can be cynically applied to obstruct informed democratic engagement. The case of Reuters\\u2019 Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo reminds the public, journalists and government of the fundamental concept of the public interest, the basis of the media\\u2019s rejection of the Cybercrime Bill 2017 in its current form. The Bill criminalises journalists who receive electronic information and the whistleblowers who provide it. In Myanmar, the son of a rice farmer and poet have been jailed because they were given documentary information and then arrested as they left a restaurant with the documents in their possession. It is a chilling illustration of how reporters can be framed, jailed and silenced for working in the public interest.

    "{\"CONTENT\": \"A cascade on the way to the abandoned village of Manantial The last man to leave: Isadore Tenia The arrow points to the location of the abandoned village The abandoned church in Monte Video A cascade on the way to the abandoned village of Manantial THERE was once a village in 19th century Trinidad called Manantial. It sat in a valley opening to the north coast. The homes were week-long projects of wood and carat leaves. No one was rich. No one was poor. The hunters most always returned with meat, and the fishing was easy. Plantain and provisions grew like weeds. The weed grew too, plentiful and potent. The mountain ravines were the washtubs and bathing pools of the people. And the spring that gave the place its Spanish name, provided clean water. So people ate well. If they survived malaria, yellow fever and dysentery, some lived long. It was a village born to support the cocoa crop. The residents were Venezuelan migrants, descendants of the African enslaved and what blood remained of the decimated First Peoples. They worked estates that thrived in perfect conditions, and lived and planted subsistence gardens on rented lands. To get to the closest \\u2018town\\u2019 meant a three kilometre walk or donkey ride under a rainforest canopy to the main road passing through the inland mountain village of Monte Video. Then there was an even longer journey to Toco, where the bridal trail ended, and where the round-the-island steam ship made a call. For some of the people here, entire lives were spent along a ten kilometre stretch of this coast. So you would think the people of Manantial could not get further away from it all. But the Christian missionaries found them. The Catholics and Anglicans were already competing for souls on the north coast when the Moravian Church elders arrived. According to the historical records, unsaved Moravians were discovered in Trinidad, so the Church sent someone over from Barbados to investigate. The Church found hundreds on Barbadian-born Moravians living godlessly in Port of Spain and fornicating in unwed squalor in Ste Madeleine, where the sugar factory employed many. And in Manantial, it was reported that: \\u201cheathen Chinese conducted a rum-shop (while) in some of the villages there were many Mahometans (Muslims), and many of the natives were still addicted to old African vices and superstitions\\u201d. The arrow points to the location of the abandoned village So the missionaries came, and stations were founded in Rosehill, Port of Spain, Chaguanas, Belmont, Ste Madeleine and Manzanilla. And in 1896, enough people donated time, money and material to build and consecrated a Sunday school and Chapel in a prominent spot in Manantial, a village whose name was corrupted by the locals to be called \\u201cManantao\\u201d. In attendance that day were thirty adults and twenty-five children. A house would be built for the teacher and catechist and the school was recognised by the Colonial Government, with the salaries of the teachers paid for by the Board of Education. As a result, Manantial\\u2019s dead no longer had to be carted off to the Catholic graveyards at Mission or Matelot. They could be churched and buried in the place of their toil. But despite the State funding, the Moravian Church couldn\\u2019t get enough people or their tithes to expand. Some moved away to work on other plantations. Their children had to labour in the fields and did not often attend. Estate owners raised the rental prices and those who couldn\\u2019t pay were evicted. The abandoned church in Monte Video An epidemic of dysentery killed some and sickened the young. And worshippers in the nearby village of L\\u2019anse Noire built their own Moravian Church to avoid having to foot it to Manantial. By 1915, the Manantial church closed, beginning a long decline. We know much of this history because of the memory of Isadore Tenia. He was the last to leave Manantial. When he and his mother walked out of the forest in 1963, the village was no more. Tenia, who turned 89-years-old in July, 2018, is also the last person alive to once live in Manantial. Today, all that remains is a concrete road sign on the Paria Road in Monte Video, bearing the village name. The sign points the way into the bush. Follow the trail, and it will lead you the seafront where the village once stood. You will see nothing made by man. The vegetation has reclaimed ownership. But beat back the undergrowth, and you will find the ruins of the church, and a single tombstone fenced by wrought iron railing. The grave contains the remains of Unalda Miller, the wife of a Manantial\\u2019s estate owner who kept a house and supply store there, and operated shops in Monte Video and Toco. \\u201cIt was in 1963 when I left\\u201d Tenia told us when we met up at his home in Monte Video. \\u201cIn the war days (the 40s) it had garden here from the road right to the sea. Three miles across. But now is only forest right across. When I left that place, I was a builder, a carpenter and I also did my gardening. So I had both. But I didn\\u2019t have a wife. Two sons, yes, but I didn\\u2019t make time to marry\\u201d. Instead, Tenia became a bush man, spending days at a time on the hunt when not constructing village houses, some if which still stand today. The last man to leave: Isadore Tenia \\u201cIt was a good place to grow up. I and my mother were the last to move out. People didn\\u2019t have a choice. The place was dying. And when we came this side to live, that was the end of the village\\u201d. Tenia remembers it all, from the balata wood that framed the house, to the constant booming of the surf against the rocks where he often spent the night fishing, of his special relationship with famed local artist and fellow mountain man Marcelio Hovell, and of his love affair with the now deceased \\u2018madam\\u2019 Rosanne La Rosa. But Tenia will never see this place again. He is blind. Note: Richard Charan is CCN's Multimedia Editor.

Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley has issued an appeal for citizens to be patriots and come out to work today in interest of country. In a statement released at 2 a.m. today, Rowley said he understand and knows the concerns for the hundreds of Petrotrin workers who will be on the breadline once the refinery is closed. However, he said the workers will not be left in the cold but will be treated with compassion and given separation packages. The Prime Minister's statement came just hours after Planning Minister Camille Robinson-Regis said Government was not \\\"overly concerned\\\" about the labour movement\\u2019s day of \\\"rest and reflection\\\" today. She said contingency plans have been put into place. The Prime Minister urged citizens to adopt a nation first approach as he stressed that there must be change to take Trinidad and Tobago forward. Yesterday, Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar called on citizens to stay at home in support of the labour movement. The Prime Minister appealed to workers to go to work. Stated Rowley: \\\"I appeal to all those who have been entrusted with the responsibility and blessing of employment to honour and respect this obligation. \\\"As public servants, our work is not just a means by which we earn a wage but the very foundation required for the nation\\u2019s sustainable growth and development. We are the stewards of the people\\u2019s business.\\u201d Rowley stated that if a course had to be charted forward for Trinidad and Tobago \\\"we will need to be proactive, progressive and productive.\\u201d He stated that it will require citizens to work harder and smarter for their own benefit. \\\"And sometimes it will call for the enforcement of unpleasant decisions today so that we can secure a better tomorrow,\\\" he stated. \\\"We cannot keep repeating the same mistakes and uphold the status quo if we want change,\\\" stated the Prime Minister. \\\"To those of you who are committed to building a better Trinidad and Tobago I urge you to adopt a nation-first approach,\\\" he continued. Rowley stated that today fellow citizens are depending on us to show up and give our best demonstration of patriotism. With respect to Petrotrin, the Prime Minister reiterated that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all affected employees, families and communities are treated with due care, dignity and respect. \\\"These changes, while absolutely necessary, will be implemented with compassion. The restructuring process will include measures to support all stakeholders as Petrotrin transitions to profitability,\\\" he stated. Rowley stated further that in the coming weeks the union and the company will work out the details regarding separation packages for employees and this may help alleviate some of the current anxieties. Government, he stated, is also working on the implementation of industrial projects that will rejuvenate the South-Western peninsula. The Prime Minister and several of his Ministers met with members of the labour movement for three hours yesterday at the Office of the Prime Minister, St Clair. The unions requested that Government revert its decision to close the Petrotrin refinery. Robinson-Regis said they agreed to disagree. Government, she said, remains firm that the refinery must be closed as it is bleeding the company of resources and keeping it in operation will result in the continued $2 billion in debt annually.

AN IN-HOUSE team at the Ministry of Works is currently undergoing training to be able to repair the life-saving cable barrier along the Solomon Hochoy Highway and the Uriah Butler Highway. When damaged, the cable barrier is expensive to repair, and as a cost cutting measure by the Ministry, a team has been identified from within the Ministry to conduct the repair and maintenance. The cable barriers, which is meant to slow vehicles in a crash and prevent catastrophic cross-over collisions, has been credited with saving lives. However, several areas along the highway, where accidents have occurred were not repaired. A Ministry official said that its engineer has begun the initial repairs works of removing the broken cable lines and steel posts which will soon be replaced. The official said an estimated cost to repair the current broken and damaged barriers is between $4-5 million. There is a local agent who supplies and install the barriers and is working with the Ministry on the training of workers for the Highways Division, the Express was told. The official said that in many instances where an individual is responsible for damage to the barriers, the Ministry makes a claim with the insurance company to pay for the repairs and Ministry workers or a contractor would be utilised for the labour works. The official said the contract for the current contractor conducting these maintenance works has expired and the Ministry is looking at renewal. In the meantime, Ministry workers are being trained to do the job. Essential President of Arrive Alive Sharon Inglefield says the cable barriers do prevent crossover collusions on the highways and is essential in saving lives. Inglefield said it is one of the reason many lives are saved. However, she said emphasis needed to be placed on maintenance of barriers rather than the construction of new highways. She added that proper signage, traffic lights and pavements, also needed to engage the attention of officials. \\u201cMost definitely the cable barriers does prevent cross over collisions and has saved the lives of many. However, too much emphasis is placed on new highways and not enough is placed on the maintenance of existing roadways,\\u201d she said. It save lives Head of the Traffic and Highway Patrol Branch, South Senior Superintendent Basdeo Ramdhanie said nine out of 10 times, when there is a car crash the cable barriers has saved a life. Of the effectiveness of the barriers, he said: \\u201cYes tremendously. The cable barriers prevents the vehicle from going over the other carriageway so the barriers serving its purpose.

This parent collects her children early on Friday due to a reduced staff turnout at the Montrose Government Primary School, Chaguanas, yesterday. PHoto STEPHEN DOOBAY Instructions by the labour movement for its members to recognise a day of \\u201crest and reflection\\u201d on Friday seemed to have gone unheeded by workers in the public and private sector. The Ministry of Health reported a 100 per cent turnout of health care workers, while the Ministry of Education reported that the majority of teachers attended school today. Minister of Public Administration Marlene McDonald said there was a 98 per cent attendance at her Ministry. She said similar numbers were recorded across the Public Service. \\u201cThe two percent of absences at the Ministries of Public Administration and Communications accounted for persons who had previously applied for and were granted time-off,\\u201d McDonald said. The Trinidad and Tobago Manufacturers Association (TTMA), Downtown Owners and Merchants Associaiton (DOMA) and the Cunupia Business Chamber also confirmed that it was business as usual among their membership today. Ministry of Health/Education At a news conference this morning, Education Minister Anthony Garcia said across the seven education districts an average of 50 per cent of the nation\\u2019s primary school teachers showed up for work today, while 52.5 per cent of secondary school teachers attended. He said there was also a 100 per cent attendance of staff at the Ministry of Education. Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh in a statement this morning said he was happy to report that health care workers across all the country\\u2019s Regional Health Authorities (RHAs) reported for work. \\u201cThis speaks volumes to the dedication of all our workers across the country, inclusive of Tobago. Today is a day where we have significantly matured as a nation, where we have heeded the call for productivity,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI want to commend all health care workers in every single RHA for manning their stations and providing care and sustenance to the sick, young and vulnerable in our country,\\u201d Deyalsingh added. Business as usual across private sector In a media release the TTMA noted that based on the feedback from its membership, the call for rest and reflection did not have the intended purpose, as workers reported for work. \\u201cOur membership\\u2019s feedback indicated that in most instances the turnout was nothing out of the ordinary in all areas of operations,\\u201d it stated. TTMA president Christopher Alcazar said: \\u201cWorkers have shown maturity and discipline and must be commended for their efforts. Their commitment to productivity and the greater good of moving the economy forward in our challenging environment is indicative that they are prepared to work together to move Trinidad and Tobago along a sustainable path of economic growth\\u201d. The Joint Chambers comprising the American Chamber of Commerce of Trinidad and Tobago (AMCHAM T&T), the Energy Chamber of Trinidad and Tobago, the Trinidad and Tobago Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the Trinidad and the TTMA said it conducted a comprehensive survey of their members this morning. It reported that 88 per cent of members stated that the \\\"illegal strike\\\" had no impact on their businesses, with ten per cent reporting a minor impact and only two per cent reporting a major impact. \\\"Ninety percent of our members reported that their absenteeism rates were at normal levels, with 7% reporting a lower absenteeism rate than for a normal Friday in September. This pattern was similar across sectors and for both unionized and non-unionized companies. The pattern was the same for both state-owned and private companies,\\\" the Joints Chambers said in a statement. The Cunupia Business Chamber reported that the unions\\u2019 \\u201crest and reflect day\\u201d did not hamper the business community of Cunupia and environs. \\u201cThere were no businesses closed and their employees were out in full numbers,\\u201d the Chamber said. \\u201cAt the schools in the district, administrative staff was out in their full numbers, teachers\\u2019 turnout was at 20 per cent and 11 per cent of students arrived at the various schools in the district this morning. The majority of parents opted to keep their kids away from the schools, causing all Government schools in the district to close around midday. In essence the \\u2018rest and reflect day\\u2019 was of no major significant impact to Cunupia and environs,\\u201d the Chamber went on. President of DOMA, Gregory Aboud, said he received no reports of absenteeism among the workforce in downtown Port of Spain. \\u201cIt has been a pretty average day in the City Centre. We view the decision to call for this day of rest and reflection as a natural part of the process of change and we accept the decision of those who think they have to stay at home today. We do not think it was the right decision to make, but we accept it and we move on to tomorrow, when we all have to make a living again,\\u201d Aboud said. Do not panic buy, says NP In view of the call for a national day of rest and reflection, the National Petroleum Marketing Company (NP) assured the public that the company has and will activate appropriate and various contingency measures across its operations, to ensure a continuous and reliable supply of fuel. It urged the public not to panic buy. NP said its priority continues to be that of ensuring the timely delivery of fuel to its service station network, airports in Trinidad and Tobago, industrial customers including the Port Authority, all hospitals and all the protective services. \\u201cNP has detailed operational and communications plans in place to deal with a range of situations with a view to minimising disruptions and/or mitigating the impact of any disruption,\\u201d NP said. \\u201cThese tried-and-tested contingency measures include, but are not limited to the deployment of NP\\u2019s management and other support staff in addition to the monitoring and maintenance of key infrastructure and plants to continue its essential operations. Furthermore, NP has collaborated with other national agencies to ensure the reliable and continuous supply of liquid fuels and cooking gas to the local market,\\u201d NP added. Normal operations says WASA/T&TEC The Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) and the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&TEC) said all operations were functioning as normal today. \\u201cAll 14 service centres are open to serve the members of the public, and our emergency lines, 800-BULB (2852) and 800-TTEC (8832), remain available to respond to all calls,\\\" T&TEC stated. \\\"The Water and Sewerage Authority (the Authority) advises customers and the general public that its systems are functional and services to customers are normal with respect to water and wastewater as well as its Ratepayers' Centres,\\\" WASA said. \\\"Preliminary assessment indicates close to full staff attendance and the Authority is currently collating data to confirm same,\\\" WASA added.

Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. bedridden but smiling: Rakesh Ramkaran at his Red Brick Trace, South Oropouche home last Thursday. \\u2014Photo: DEXTER PHILIP Rakesh Ramkaran should not be alive. Not after being shot through the head. He was working as a security guard at a hardware store one night in March 2017 when robbers shot him. When found at daybreak, Ramkaran was unconscious on the ground next to his guard booth, a gaping hole through the head. He had bled all night. The criminals took his bulletproof vest, clothes, shoes and a knapsack. Ramkaran, 27, was taken to the Siparia Health Centre. Little could be done there so he was transferred to the San Fernando General Hospital. Scans found that the bullet had entered the frontal lobe of the brain, above the right eye and exited through the back of his head. It was never recovered. Ramkaran was hooked up to life support machines in the Intensive Care Unit. The prognosis was grim. He was in a vegetative state, and had no body movement. He could only blink his eyes. His condition began deteriorating. Doctors told relatives that he had a 20 per cent chance of surviving. The family began preparing for a funeral. The funeral never came. Rakesh lived. He slowly improved. His first voluntary action was to squeeze his mother\\u2019s hand. He opened his eyes one day. And slowly began speaking. And Ramkaran\\u2019s memory from before the shooting remains intact. It is an incredible example of human resilience and the will to live. Three months later, in July 2017, the medical team told his relatives to take him home. Labour of love Rakesh Ramkaran had left home on March 15, 2017, as the sole breadwinner of a poor family, and the father of a baby boy, to work the night shift at the hardware in Penal. He returned home all those months later, in an ambulance. Home is an old house of wood and galvanised roofing sheets, perched on pillars at the end of a track off Red Brick Trace, South Oropouche. There is no indoor plumbing. Ramkaran lives there with his mother Okar, 54, sister Daminie, 24, brother-in-law Phillip Hospedales, several cats and dogs, and a parrot. This family has very little money, so they cannot provide the best care possible for this critically injured man. But they have not turned their backs on him. It has been a labour of love. Ramkaran will never recover all his motor skills. The right side of his body spasms involuntarily. His eyes bulge. His speech is slurred. He spends his day in bed looking at television. Family members clean and bathe him. He however knows that his mentally challenged father Rajnanan Ramkaran, 51, has disappeared. The man had been missing for the past four months, having left one night to attend a Hindu prayer service and never came back. The family believes he is dead even though his body not been found. The Express visited the family last Thursday. We found a family still hopeful that despite the odds, Rakesh has a future and a chance to recover fully. Sister Daminie said: \\u201cHis first word (when he was recovering) was my name, Leenee. That\\u2019s my home name. He can recognise people and speak, not clearly. When he is talking you have to really listen to what he is saying. He can move his right side but on his left, it is paralysed. When he sees people around him he would always smile. I think he missed doing that. \\u201cIt is not a burden for us to take care of him. We are all here and he is my brother. Having him in this condition is not a burden.\\u201d Help for family An Arima family, the Abdools, graciously donated materials to construct the room in which Ramkaran and his mother stay. While speaking about the family\\u2019s generosity, Rakesh was able to utter two words. \\u201cNice people.\\u201d Daminie said the Abdool family would still visit and provide a sense of comfort to her family as they too have a bedridden relative. Taking Rakesh for physical therapy at the hospital has been a challenge for the family as each visit costs $350. Daminie said they have been trying to help him with physiotherapy exercises at home. \\u201cMy mom would rub his body and we give him those softballs to squeeze. I would use it then he would throw it away. He would get frustrated but we are patient with him,\\u201d she said. The father of one remembers his son. When speaking about the child, Rakesh shouted out his son\\u2019s name: \\u201cRicardo.\\u201d Daminie said the child\\u2019s mother and son would visit Rakesh which always makes him happy. Rakesh\\u2019s employers, Travtech Security Services, continues to provide financial assistance. Fyzabad MP Dr Lackram Bodoe has provided hampers with supplies for the family. Kind-hearted readers also showed their support by sending financial assistance or basic supplies to the family since the shooting. How Rakesh survived The Express spoke with a neurosurgeon employed with the South West Regional Health Authority. The doctor said that there have been cases where people have survived gunshot injuries to the brain. It all depended on the trajectory of the bullet, how much damage was done to the brain cells, and what part of the brain was impacted. The doctor said the type of bullet would also affect the outcome for the victim. \\u201cPost-operative care is key. It would also help him recover,\\u201d he said. No evidence There is CCTV security camera footage that recorded two men entering the hardware early on the morning that Ramkaran was shot. Police have identified suspects but do not have enough evidence. Investigators know there are people living in the Penal area who have the information needed to make arrests. These people need to be brave enough to step forward because somebody knows something. If you have information, please call the Penal Police at 746-1231-4.
