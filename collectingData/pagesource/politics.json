It seems that beating heart has now become \\u00adimplicated in the bizarre real-life story of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, confirmed dead, last seen through Alice\\u2019s looking glass entering the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey on October 2. Consequences for the Fourth Estate are still being analysed amid chilling speculation about an interrogation, a bone saw, and dismemberment. As US President Donald Trump wavers in his response, journalists and public-interest collectives sound the alarm, which has grown louder after explosive devices were mailed to political opponents and the media that President Trump has branded \\u201can enemy of the American people\\u201d. Academics ruminate on the challenges to news reporting when two authoritarian governments are involved, each \\u00adexercising iron control of the press and each leaking its own propaganda within layered, competing versions of what \\u00adhappened to Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia has responded to international suspicions with grave threats, one of which was issued by the United Arab \\u00adEmirates minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar \\u00adGargash, \\u00addescribed as usually a man of considerable tact. Minister \\u00adGargash was reported as saying, \\u201cThere is a need to show the reality of the human dimension of the situation as the repercussions of the political targeting of Saudi Arabia will be dire for those who fuel it.\\u201d As Trumpian sentiment and behaviour spread and germinate on the fertile grounds of other nations, we note the persistent use of \\u201cfake news\\u201d by political representatives here. We note, too, the developing antagonism between Communications Minister \\u00adStuart Young and members of the media invited to frequent news briefings. Though the Khashoggi case and pipe bombs mailed to media houses and political opponents are extreme expressions, and the latter likely connected to the heightened political charge of US domestic elections, our own landscape has witnessed \\u00adsufficient vile defamation of journalists and media houses to take note and issue a caution to all political public speakers. Words do matter. One week ago today, journalists set forth to bear witness to devastating flooding across large swathes of the island. In some cases they were first responders. Their independent coverage transmitted to the population all the tear drops in the floodwaters and positioned them to ask hard questions of the Government that took the lead in co-ordination of rescue and relief efforts. In so doing, the institution of the press has been commendably serving the public\\u2019s right to know, and has put itself in \\u00adbetter standing with a public that had grown wary of its credibility. This newspaper recognises the efforts of the media fraternity and commits to fearlessly inform the public and hold public \\u00adoffice holders to account. In that project the media and politicians will have skirmishes. The Khashoggi case is an \\u00adas-yet-distant \\u00adreminder of why each side must, at all times, respect the role of the other in the service of the greater good.

Then, when times get too tough to fund vote-getting strategies, the very governments that put politics first will mount their self-righteous horses and insist that the country tighten its economic belt. Over and over, our story is one of short-sighted policies that fail to take account of the single most important economic fact that T&T's income is almost completely dependent on a depleting resource in a market determined by factors beyond our control. If that single fact could sink into our heads we would not hang our hats where we cannot reach when petro peaks collapse into troughs. Instead, we would prioritise sustainable initiatives with a good chance of surviving erratic market behaviour while keeping a hawk's eye on wastage. This point needs to be re-stated in the context of the government's alarums about wastage and over-spending. In the education sector alone, well after the horse has bolted, there is loud anguish about the wastage in GATE\\u2014the Government Assistance for Tuition Expenses programme, the School Feeding Programme, the School Transport Service and the free laptop programme for every first former. Possibly hundreds of millions of dollars that could have been available today to sustain these programmes well into the future for those who need them, have been wasted because of the high priority on vote-getting. Underpinning the education free-for-all frenzy was lax accountability, poor monitoring and exorbitant administrative costs. The sobering point to be made is that no government could get away with such mismanagement of the economy without the complicity of the rest of the society. With the drastic fall in the level of national income, the scales have been removed from our eyes. While the Rowley administration is right to deplore the wild and reckless spending of the Persad-Bissessar administration as it fights to keep the economy afloat, let us not forget that Dr Rowley and key members of his Cabinet were in the Manning cabinet which was on a spree of its own when the price of oil hit $148 a barrel in 2008. Further, it should be said that such behaviour was consistent with the spending pattern laid down in the mid-1970s when prime minister Dr Eric Williams threw planning out of the window as he went on his own spree after the OPEC oil embargo turned Trinbagonians into the sheiks of the Caribbean. The point is that almost nothing that is being said today about wastage is new. What would be new is if we somehow found the capacity to break the cycle of boom and bust by resisting the temptation to play cheap politics with the economy. However, that is easier said than done. It takes real political leadership to win popular support for tough programmes. In the absence of such leadership, political parties are reduced to bribing the electorate, even when the money runs low. Until the political culture changes to allow truly accountable government, Trinidad and Tobago will remain stuck in a zero-sum game, where waste and want dwell in the same house.

IN ONCE again giving ministerial rank to Marlene McDonald, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley must believe that the odds inside his party are not securely in his favour as he prepares his campaign for re-election as political leader of the People's National Movement (PNM) in the party's elections due in June. Only politics, and not national governance considerations, can explain the PM's patently illogical decision to have the Port of Spain South MP sworn in a third time, given the multiple clouds that hang over her regarding allegations of abuse of office, use of public funds and connections to individuals of suspect income. With an active police investigation still being conducted into her possible role in the distribution of public funds to her husband's organisation, the political stakes must be very high for Dr Rowley to risk the worst-case scenario of having one of his ministers arrested and hauled to court. In attending her swearing-in, Dr Rowley was wise to keep his silence given that there is no compelling governance reason for her promotion to ministerial rank and, in particular, to be assigned the communications portfolio. The best that can be said about Ms McDonald's suitability for the portfolio is that in her ten years in Parliament she has not demonstrated any particular interest or aptitude in the field of communications. Dr Rowley's rationalisation that 'everybody deserves a second chance' is farcical given the tough, uncompromising position that he had very rightly adopted against former prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar in her handling of ministerial transgressions. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, realpolitik would appear to be holding sway over his declared commitment to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may. Whether he recognises it or not, in arguing for a second chance for Ms McDonald, Dr Rowley is asking for a second chance for himself. Since there has been no demand for her return at the level of the national community, one can assume that it is Ms McDonald and her supporters within the ruling PNM who are being asked to give him a second chance. The fact that Dr Rowley is motivated to go so far beyond his own political comfort zone to accommodate a nationally unpopular decision that could open him up to ridicule reveals his own assessment of the strength of his political base inside the PNM with leadership elections due in three months' time. While Ms McDonald does not have a national base, and possibly not even a substantial constituency base that is more loyal to her than to the PNM, her base inside the party may be politically valuable enough for Dr Rowley to run the risk of taking egg on his face a third time around. While it is not known whether the recent unrest in Laventille also factored into the PM's decision to promote the Port of Spain South MP, it cannot be ruled out given Ms McDonald's known links to so-called 'community leaders'. As he pursues his high stakes gamble with the re-appointment of Ms McDonald, the greater risk may not be for Dr Rowley but to all T&T.

FRIDAY night\\u2019s shock collapse of Guyana\\u2019s ruling coalition government has thrown that country into a state of political upheaval with far-reaching implications for the geopolitics of the region. If the government led by David Granger had any inkling of the defeat coming, they certainly did not let on. Mere hours before the opposition\\u2019s no-confidence motion went to the vote, Prime Minister Moses Nagamootoo was on a television show confidently declaring that he had \\u201cnot a scintilla of doubt\\u201d that the motion would be defeated while suggesting it may even be withdrawn. \\u201cNo government MP would vote for this motion,\\u201d he insisted. As it turned out, it was a fellow MP from Nagamootoo\\u2019s own party, the Alliance For Change (AFC), who hammered the nail into the government\\u2019s coffin. Time will tell whether MP Charandass Persaud\\u2019s vote was an act of conscience, as he declared, or a political sell-out, as his stunned critics immediately claimed. Interviewed as he exited parliament on Friday night, the attorney MP denied any form of collusion with the opposition PPP or its leader, Bharrat Jagdeo. Indeed, Persaud said it was seeing how members of Jagdeo\\u2019s government had enriched themselves that had driven him to leave a successful legal practice and get into politics in the first place. \\u201cA lot of them were getting rich, real rich and we\\u2019re not doing anything differently,\\u201d he said. After three-and-a-half years in government, he said he had become increasingly disillusioned by the AFC\\u2019s lack of influence in the ruling coalition. \\u201cThis is the one time I had a say and I said it according to my conscience,\\u201d he declared, adding he was prepared to accept the consequences of his decision, including death. He had been particularly hurt by the statement of health minister Volda Lawrence about jobs for members of her party, the PNC, and about the government decision which had led to the \\u201cdestruction of the lives of sugar workers in a village\\u201d in his district. \\u201cI can\\u2019t live with that,\\u201d he said. Persaud\\u2019s departure comes at a time when the Granger government is already on the ropes, having suffered a substantial defeat in recent local government elections. It is also beset by leadership ambiguity given President Granger\\u2019s cancer diagnosis. In a show of maturity, PM Nagamootoo quickly accepted the government\\u2019s defeat and immediately focused the public\\u2019s attention on the constitutional requirement of elections within three months. Guyana\\u2019s leaders must know that their country cannot afford to slip back down the slope of political disruption and violence. Any escalation of political uncertainty will have a negative effect on its social fabric as well as the massive inflows of foreign investment, including from Trinidad and Tobago, since ExxonMobil\\u2019s find of enormous oil reserves. Caught between strife-torn Venezuela and the emerging tensions among the world\\u2019s superpowers on its doorstep, Guyana must prioritise internal stability. All of Caricom will be rooting for the Guyanese people to hold it together and rise to the challenge of an unexpected election campaign. Hopefully by the end of March, they would have succeeded in peacefully installing the next government of their choice.

If the government led by David Granger had any inkling of the defeat coming, they certainly did not let on. Mere hours before the opposition\\u2019s no-confidence motion went to the vote, Prime Minister Moses Nagamootoo was on a television show confidently declaring that he had \\u201cnot a scintilla of doubt\\u201d that the motion would be defeated while suggesting it may even be withdrawn. \\u201cNo government MP would vote for this motion,\\u201d he insisted. As it turned out, it was a fellow MP from Nagamootoo\\u2019s own party, the Alliance For Change (AFC), who hammered the nail into the government\\u2019s coffin. Time will tell whether MP Charandass Persaud\\u2019s vote was an act of conscience, as he declared, or a political sell-out, as his stunned critics immediately claimed. Interviewed as he exited parliament on Friday night, the attorney MP denied any form of collusion with the opposition PPP or its leader, Bharrat Jagdeo. Indeed, Persaud said it was seeing how members of Jagdeo\\u2019s government had enriched themselves that had driven him to leave a successful legal practice and get into politics in the first place. \\u201cA lot of them were getting rich, real rich and we\\u2019re not doing anything differently,\\u201d he said. After three-and-a-half years in government, he said he had become increasingly disillusioned by the AFC\\u2019s lack of influence in the ruling coalition. \\u201cThis is the one time I had a say and I said it according to my conscience,\\u201d he declared, adding he was prepared to accept the consequences of his decision, including death. He had been particularly hurt by the statement of health minister Volda Lawrence about jobs for members of her party, the PNC, and about the government decision which had led to the \\u201cdestruction of the lives of sugar workers in a village\\u201d in his district. \\u201cI can\\u2019t live with that,\\u201d he said. Persaud\\u2019s departure comes at a time when the Granger government is already on the ropes, having suffered a substantial defeat in recent local government elections. It is also beset by leadership ambiguity given President Granger\\u2019s cancer diagnosis. In a show of maturity, PM Nagamootoo quickly accepted the government\\u2019s defeat and immediately focused the public\\u2019s attention on the constitutional requirement of elections within three months. Guyana\\u2019s leaders must know that their country cannot afford to slip back down the slope of political disruption and violence. Any escalation of political uncertainty will have a negative effect on its social fabric as well as the massive inflows of foreign investment, including from Trinidad and Tobago, since ExxonMobil\\u2019s find of enormous oil reserves. Caught between strife-torn Venezuela and the emerging tensions among the world\\u2019s superpowers on its doorstep, Guyana must prioritise internal stability. All of Caricom will be rooting for the Guyanese people to hold it together and rise to the challenge of an unexpected election campaign. Hopefully by the end of March, they would have succeeded in peacefully installing the next government of their choice.

NEW YORK, Jul. 24, CMC \\u2013 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has granted pardons to Caribbean and other immigrants convicted of minor offenses, even as President Donald Trump and the United States Federal Government continue to wage war on immigrant communities. On Monday, Cuomo issued pardons to seven individuals, including nationals from Jamaica, Barbados and the Dominica Republic who faced deportation and other consequences as a result of previous minor criminal convictions. This is the third time the governor has used his pardon authority to protect individuals facing potential deportation \\u2013 most recently in December where he issued pardons to 18 other individuals. \\u201cAt a time when President Trump and the federal government are waging a war on our immigrant communities, New York stands firm in our belief that our diversity is our greatest strength,\\u201d said Cuomo. \\u201cWhile President Trump engages in policies that rip children out of the arms of their mothers and tries to ramp up the deportation of New Yorkers to advance his political agenda of hate and division, we will protect our immigrant communities. \\u201cWith the Statue of Liberty in our harbor, New York will always stand against the hate coming out of Washington and instead serve as a beacon of hope and opportunity for all,\\u201d the governor said in a statement. Cuomo said the pardons issued are in recognition of the individuals rehabilitative efforts and to remove the barriers that their criminal records present to their immigration status. He said some are facing deportation, while others wish to be able to participate in their communities as citizens of the country they call home. In each case, Cuomo said a pardon will make immigration-related relief possible, if not automatic. He said every recipient in is in good standing, having given back to their communities and families in a variety of ways, and having \\u201cdemonstrated a substantial period of crime-free, good citizenship.\\u201d Cuomo said Jamaican Tamar Samuda, 35, left the US to travel to Jamaica for family funeral, and, on return, was detained by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency as a result of convictions from 17 years ago. \\u201cShe was released on immigration parole in February 2018, and continues to fight her deportation,\\u201d the governor said. Since her convictions for low-level assault and petit larceny, Cuomo said she obtained a GED, a high school diploma equivalency, and completed medical assistant training, and works in home health care and doctors\\u2019 offices. Cuomo said Samuda is a single mother of three school-aged children. She was cleared to work as an aide in New York City public school special education, but immigration detention prevented her from doing so, Cuomo said. He said Barbadian national Frank Barker, 43, has been \\u201ccrime-free\\u201d for nine years. He was convicted of criminal possession of stolen property and controlled substances and identity theft from a short-term period of criminal activity resulting from drug addiction. Cuomo said he has been sober for eight years and works as a coordinator at an HIV/AIDS supportive housing provider in New York City, is a certified substance abuse counselor and a community advocate in the Bronx. \\u201cHe is the financial provider for his family including his daughter with special needs,\\u201d the governor said. The New York governor said the other parolees are from the Dominican Republic and Colombia. The Dominican Republic nationals are Carlos Suarez, 41; Elpidio Rodriguez, 57; Ludames De La Cruz, 53; and Jose Rafael Cruz, 53. The Colombian national is Marino Soto, 43. Cuomo said he has used his ability to grant clemency to reward rehabilitation, reunite families, protect against deportation and help New Yorkers become fully contributing members of our society. Since taking office, he said he has issued 34 pardons, 12 commutations and 140 conditional youth pardons.

OWTU President General Ancel Roget GOVERNMENT will suffer political death for blessing the decision by Petrotrin\\u2019s Board to close the company\\u2019s refinery operations and send home workers. This was the warning coming from president general of the Oilfield Workers Trade Union (OWTU) Ancel Roget, who met with Petrotrin board members yesterday before addressing workers distressed workers. In a rambling hour long address, Roget said: \\u201cI want to warn that there is a very high, incalculable political price to be paid and we will ensure that, that political death is paid when the time comes\\u201d. The company said the restructuring was necessary to curtail losses and set it on a path to sustainable profitability. Approximately 2,600 permanent jobs will be affected \\u2013 with a redesigned Exploration and Production business to have approximately 800 workers and all 1,700 jobs in refining will be terminated. Roget said it was disrespectful that on the eve of Trinidad and Tobago\\u2019s 56th independence a decision was made to shut down the oil company. Addressing workers at Beaumont Hill, Pointe a Pierre, Roget said had disagreed with the decision. He said the trade union was give three options during the meeting with the Board members \\u2013 have the company continue operations as it is, have a scaled down version of Petrotrin or shut down the refinery. \\u201cThey propose to send everybody home, and hire back 800 persons for E&P and hire back 200 persons for the terminaling operation in pointe a Pierre. That is what (Prime Minister) Dr Rowley , (Energy Minister) Franklin Khan, the Cabinet of the PNM government those who feel that love them. They propose to send all the Petrotrin workers home and have 800 applied for E&P and 200 for some small terminaling operations in Pointe a Pierre. And that the total workforce they will end up with at the end of the day, is 1000 workers across the company,\\u201d he said. Roget warned that any move to shut down Petrotrin\\u2019s Pointe-a-Pierre refinery and send home 2,600 permanent employees would result in the death of the Peoples\\u2019a National Movement (PNM) and the Keith Rowley-led Government. He said the problems at the company simply an issue of poor management. And he questioned why the board would want to shut down a refinery which was still in full operation. \\u201cIf they believe that they can attack the OWTU because that is what it seems it is, attacking the OWTU by closing down our biggest bargaining agent where we have some fixed bargaining unit and that they will get away with that, for that I want to warn that there is a very high, incalculable political price to be paid and we will ensure that, that political death is paid when the time comes. Petrotrin workers, you can\\u2019t agree that you can stand idly by and allow Dr Rowley and Espinet to take the jobs away from you but even worst with absolutely no justification,\\u201d he said. Roget said he was informed that the wheels have already started to turn. He said the Board confirmed that plans were in place to stop ordering crude and to draw down on stock and reserve in preparation for closure of the refinery. He warned the nation of the ripple effects, saying the closure of Petrotrin would not only affect the workers and their families. \\u201cI also want to warn people in the fence line community. I also want to warn the suppliers who supply various items, food, all of whom depend on Petrotrin. Petrotrin is not just its workers it is its workers, fence line communities, suppliers, a multiplier effect, a significant number of people depend on this company,\\u201d he said. But he warned, \\u201cAnd this will mark the end of Dr Rowley. It will mark the end of the PNM.

When they call we must not be in any of their gatherings at all. Any worker who responds to be in the PNM is a worker who is not only against himself but against all of us.\\u201d Roget said the closure of Petrotrin would see the country spin into chaos and mayhem.

Ordinary citizens have led the way in demonstrating a sense of commendable humanity in their responses to the effects of flooding for families in homes in various parts of the country. Courageous individuals braved danger in deploying boats and pirogues, venturing into dangerous, uncertain waters, helping to move persons trapped and marooned in their homes, facing rising waters, and watching the damage or destruction of, in many cases, all that they have worked for. Others got together to organise food and vital supplies relief. People opened their homes, churches, mandirs, mosques and other places of worship to be used as temporary shelters, while still others supplied cooking ingredients to those gathered in several well organised operations to prepare, and/or distribute meals. It didn\\u2019t matter their political persuasion, or affiliation. Those citizens, as always, continue to deserve our heartfelt thanks, and our unreserved gratitude. Private sector organisations big and small, as well as any number of civic agencies, saw in this a duty to get involved, and this they did, commendably. Such exemplary display, indeed the spirit about which we are known as a people, ought to have been seen as the signal for those of our representatives in parliament to take the lead, in forging rare alliance, in addressing the widespread flooding and its impact. Not satisfied with the government\\u2019s overall approach to treating with this emergency, the Leader of the Opposition called for the activation of a section of the Disasters Measures Act. The government took the position that this was not warranted. Whether rightly or wrongly, this ought not to have prevented the opposition from joining hands with the government and the state agencies involved in the relief and the rescue efforts in what would have been hailed as indeed a moment of true national unity. Those MPs and other political figures on the opposition side who helped, or themselves led rescue and relief efforts in whichever parts of the country, were doing what would have come naturally in the circumstances. But to stage a walk-out in the Senate, where none of its members has direct responsibility to persons in any specific constituency, was simply an exercise in despoliation. Nothing could have been gained from it. There was no point to be made in this fashion, except to further entrench in the minds of more citizens the emptiness behind many a political manoeuvre by those elected or selected to represent the people\\u2019s interest. The senators would not have taken such action on their own, hence blame for this regrettable demonstration of \\u201cpolitics as usual\\u201d must be placed squarely at the feet of the Leader of the Opposition and those around her who may have contributed to it. It represents nothing more than the squandering of another opportunity for the political maturity that is so sorely needed in our society.

The latest example of this problem was last week\\u2019s decision by Guyana\\u2019s executive president, David Granger, former head of the country\\u2019s Defence Force, to frustrate the release of historic commemorative stamps to coincide with celebratory activities marking the 100th birth anniversary of that Caricom nation\\u2019s best known political leader \\u2014 Cheddi Jagan. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling.

International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom.

The inauguration yesterday of right-wing political outsider, President Jair Bolsonaro, marks a radical shift away from the progressive democracy that had been rebuilding itself over the past three decades following a long period of military rule. The social and political crisis provided the opportunity for Bolsonaro to rise to the presidency. Endemic corruption and violence had long emerged as the most oppressive issues for Brazilians feeling the deep cut of unemployment and related economic pressures; Bolsonaro\\u2019s outbursts at both, rocking the status quo, matched the national mood and fired the support of large segments of the population. Himself a victim of a near-fatal stabbing, Bolsonaro ran a presidential campaign calling for the blood of criminals in a country whose staggering levels of violence claimed more than 60,000 lives in 2017. The president, often seen flashing a gun sign, advocates decorating police officers who kill criminals. Among his proposals are using snipers aboard helicopters to kill anyone seen carrying a weapon in the country\\u2019s notorious favelas, prosecuting juveniles as adults, and he has endorsed torture. Between March and September last year, army and police killings increased by 45 per cent. The failure of similar anti-crime strategies in Mexico and Honduras has not deterred Bolsonaro or diminished his support. A common class contradiction found among the growing number of nations swinging to the political right is also evident in Brazil: the populist Bolsonaro seized upon the population\\u2019s deep discontent with corruption and promised a crackdown on graft while his support base features wealthy elites, those segments of the population willing to trade the rights and lives of the poor for their own safety and economic prosperity and traditional politicians themselves responsible for the socio-economic decline in the world\\u2019s fourth largest democracy. Although he has pledged to adhere to democratic principles of governance, Bolsonaro has also mouthed undisguised anti-democratic principles, appealing to those who conclude that democracy has simply not delivered better lives. A 2017 poll found only 32 per cent of Brazilians consider democracy, albeit flawed, the best system of government. Homophobia, misogyny and racism characterised Bolsonaro\\u2019s campaign rhetoric, along with a concerted push against environmentalists in a country that had been leading the world in conservation of the life-sustaining Amazon rainforest. The new president has promised mining on indigenous lands, a paved highway through the Amazon, no more environment ministry and withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. Brazil yesterday joined a growing number of Latin American nations supportive of candidates with right-wing leanings who make political opportunities out of socio-political crises. Implications for this country\\u2019s foreign relations in the Americas must preoccupy our Government; mass support for authoritarian strategies must detain a population gazing at its own socio economic challenges.

In a release today, the UNC commended the police for their work but condemned the Ministers for engaging in public relations for political mileage. \\\"In fact, we wish to condemn and denounce categorically the presence of these two government Ministers who obviously sought to utilise the moment for inexpensive public relations and marketing,\\\" stated the UNC. \\\"That these two Ministers, who incidentally have developed an unparalleled affection for media spotlight, took crude advantage to bolster their dwindling political image is insulting to both the innocent victim of this crime and to the initiatives of the police service.

It was 56 years ago that the then-minister of home affairs, Patrick Solomon, went into the Woodbrook Police Station and removed his stepson who was under arrest, unleashing a public opinion backlash against ministerial abuse and over-reach in matters involving the police. And, public suspicion was not helped when, in 2002, then-prime minister Patrick Manning phoned the Marabella Police Station after learning that his former driver had been arrested and was being held there. Both are among the prominent politicians who have had to learn the hard way that, whatever the deficiencies of the Police Service, the T&T public is jealously protective of the independence of the Police Service from even the suspicion of abuse by politicians. While Minister Le Hunte is convinced of his right as a citizen to register his objection to the attitude of the officer whom he claimed was abusive to him, he must understand that he is no ordinary citizen. As a government minister, he is a symbol of political power. This is not to excuse the officer on duty or to deny the evident lack of planning at the corner of Dock Road and Wrightson Road over the weekend where T&TEC work necessitated the closure of Dock Road to traffic. Minister Le Hunte was not the only motorist to be inconvenienced by the abrupt closure without signage. The difference between him and the rest of us is that he is the Minister of Public Utilities and, as such, should have been aware of his own responsibility to the public interest instead of simply seeing himself as a private citizen being victimised by unprofessional policing. If there was an urgent call Minister Le Hunte needed to make on the spot was to T&TEC for which he holds portfolio responsibility. The priority in this case should have been a speedy resolution by T&TEC and the police of the inconvenience being caused to the motoring public. In insisting on his right to stand against perceived police abuse, Minister Le Hunte noted Commissioner Griffith\\u2019s publicising of the cellphone number 482-GARY for the public to take their complaints directly to him. However, Minister Le Hunte would have been one of the lucky ones if he phoned 482-GARY and got directly on to Commissioner Griffith. Callers to that number were yesterday greeted with the message that the mailbox was full. Not only did the minister get the Commissioner on the phone but he managed to get him to go to the scene. As the Police Commissioner put it, he went \\u201cto see if I could speak to police officers to calm the situation.\\u201d If neither leader can see what is wrong with this picture, they need more than a history lesson. If there was abuse at Dock Road on Sunday, it was clearly not limited to an errant police officer.

And none of the political parties in Trinidad and Tobago was prepared to change. Panday, founder of the United National Congress (UNC), has not confirmed that a new political movement is brewing. But he noted that the people of Trinidad and Tobago seem lost and all political parties should expect competition.

Last month, San Juan/Barataria MP Dr Fuad Khan called for the return of Basdeo Panday and other party stalwarts to the UNC to give it a better chance of beating the Peoples National Movement in a general election. Mickela Panday said, however, that the current leader of the party was refusing to meet with her. Panday who was screened as a general election candidate but was unsuccessful in the lead up to the 2010 general election. She stated: \\\"This morning Dr Fuad Khan informed me that on Friday 9th March, 2018 he spoke with the political leader of the UNC, Mrs Kamla Persad-Bissessar, regarding whether she would be willing to meet with various members of the Party, including myself, in the interest of uniting the Party. During that conversation Mrs. Persad- Bissessar stated unequivocally that she is unwilling to meet with me, or certain other members. According to Dr Khan, the reason given for her refusal to meet with me and other members is that the political leader is unhappy with what she perceives to be our \\u201ccriticizing the Party\\u201d, in my case in my newspaper column\\u201d. Panday\\u2019s brother, Subhas Panday, was also rejected by the UNC in the lead up to the 2010 general election.

She said: \\\"This morning Dr Fuad Khan informed me that on Friday 9th March, 2018 he spoke with the political leader of the UNC, Mrs Kamla Persad-Bissessar, regarding whether she would be willing to meet with various members of the Party, including myself, in the interest of uniting the Party. During that conversation Mrs. Persad- Bissessar stated unequivocally that she is unwilling to meet with me, or certain other members.

Mickela Panday said: \\u201cIf this is the reason upon which Mrs. Persad- Bissessar has made her decision not to meet with me or these other members, it is truly unfortunate for democracy and for freedom of speech within the Party, as in effect the political leader is saying that those within the party who choose to speak out against what they believe to be wrong-doing will be excluded. I do not believe that calling for transparency and accountability is criticizing the Party. That being said, the political leader has made her decision and I will respect it.

Not lost on Justice Frank Seepersad was the \\u201cculture of kickbacks and corruption\\u201d that emerged in the evidence in what would seem to be the innocuous matter of Mr Warner\\u2019s default in the repayment of a $1.5 million loan from Real Time Systems. Justice Seepersad pulled no punches in delivering his judgment against Mr Warner: \\u201cThere is an entrenched public perception that elected officers can be sold to the highest bidder and that campaign contributions are the functional equivalent of bribes which ensure that favourable treatment is given by the government to those who provide the said funds. The evidence adduced in this matter demonstrates that this perception may well be the reality which unfolds.\\u201d What played out before Justice Seepersad was a sordid tale of political influence-peddling and greedy aspirations for state capture that have nothing to do with democratic politics. In the naked trading between politician and political investor the individual voter emerges as a puppet. Justice Seepersad warned about the dangers of the free-for-all that defines the T&T political landscape. \\u201cIn the absence of regulations financiers can legitimately purchase goodwill and exercise undue influence over politicians and political parties.\\u201d In short, without an effective regulatory framework, the government can be bought and sold without consequences. Unfortunately, despite the occasional howls of outrage, no political party has demonstrated the will to reform the beast of campaign financing. The obvious reason is that there is no incentive for doing so in a political culture that places little value on the integrity that assures representation. The political rewards go to those with the most corn who can feed the most fowls. The lack of outrage about some of the evidence presented in this case regarding alleged discussions between Mr Warner and United National Congress (UNC) financier Krishna Lalla reveals much about the tolerance for this brand of politics. Until the electorate rises to its own defence and demands legislative reform to protect the power of the vote from being hijacked by political investors, the culture of \\u201ckickbacks and corruption\\u201d that Justice Seepersad warned about will continue to define the politics of this country. This ruling therefore presents an opportune moment for electoral activism in support of campaign finance reform well before the next general election. Jack Warner rose to prominence as one of the country\\u2019s most influential political figures, largely on the basis of his ability to raise money for the UNC. While he may be the most successful political fundraiser ever, he was not the first nor will he be the last. If T&T is to change the dynamic to put power into the hands of the individual voter, it must break the back of the corrupt system of campaign financing that allows political investors to capture the state and appropriate the people\\u2019s power. Change will not come from political lip service but from the people\\u2019s demand for the political system to be protected from opportunistic politicians and investors.

However, while Messrs Mouttet and Thomas may be respected in their given fields, their locus standi in matters involving political and public service accountability may be questionable. Cast in a role somewhere between hand-picked consultants to the Prime Minister and unofficial commissions of enquiry, their appointments have the veneer of independence and authority. However, they have no power of investigation, no access to information beyond what is provided by the Prime Minister and no authority to interview people or to commandeer evidence. In such circumstances, it is surprising that seasoned public figures would even accept the briefs which effectively serve to buy the Government political space and give it cover in crisis situations. In the case of the Dominica vote, we have to agree with the former head of the Public Service, Reginald Dumas. What is the point of Dr Rowley referring documentation relevant to the OAS vote to Ambassador Thomas for review after he has publicly concluded that his Foreign Affairs Minister bears no responsibility for it? If there is a story behind the correspondence, Ambassador Thomas has no authority for venturing there. In any case, none of the documents read out by the Prime Minister explain the apparent breakdown between the senior public servants in the Ministry of Foreign and Caricom Affairs and the minister. At least since January, the ministry has adopted a policy of negative support for financial alleviation at the level of Caricom and the Association of Caribbean States. Is the public to accept that Minister Moses had no clue about this? If so, why? What is the source of this disconnect at the ministry that has resulted in the shaming of Trinidad and Tobago within the Caricom family and its embarrassment on the world stage? If the minister is blameless and the fault, as Dr Rowley has suggested, lies with the top public servants, one would expect that ministerial accountability would require Minister Moses to address the issue. Instead, the Prime Minister has once again, as he has done so many times before, put himself as a shield between his minister and the angry public. If the problem, as Dr Rowley has concluded, is due to public servant error, then the appropriate place for dealing with it is through the Public Service Commission, not through Ambassador Thomas. In choosing to protect his minister, as he did on Thursday, Dr Rowley has clearly decided that Mr Moses is worth the political currency that is being burnt up on his behalf.
