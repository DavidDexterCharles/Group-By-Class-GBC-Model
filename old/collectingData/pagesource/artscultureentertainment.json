DJ's do damage The nation palanced into 2010 and continued to frolic to the phenomenal hit song well past Ash Wednesday when radio personalities cum soca artistes, JW and Blaze were declared the year's Road March winners. Racking up a play count of an amazing 417 times on the road Carnival Monday and Tuesday, \\\"Palance\\\" beat defending Road March queen, Fay-Ann Lyons whose \\\"True Lies\\\" came in second with just 40 plays. Machel Montano took third place with his \\\"No Behaviour,\\\" which garnered only 11 plays. JW and Blaze convincingly also won the International Soca Monarch title on Carnival Friday becoming the first duo act to do so. In the way of airplay \\\"Palance\\\" enjoyed a platform other Road March winners did not as the song received heavy rotation on at least ten radio stations, free to air and cable television as well as over the internet on sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Toronto Lime and others. Of course there was some controversy over \\\"Palance\\\" as some soca artistes complained that with JW and Blaze being radio and television personalities the field of play was set in their favour as their song and accompanying video would receive as much airplay as they wished. Some artistes expressed the opinion that radio DJs and television VJs had no right singing soca. JW, Blaze and other radio and television personalities such as Shal Marshall, Supa Jigga TC and Akil \\\"5-Star\\\" Borneo who also perform soca and other forms of music defended themselves saying that it is everyone's right to be a performing artiste if they so desire. \\\"There is no degree or special training required to sing soca. If a person, whoever that may be, desires to sing soca there is nothing that can stop them,\\\" JW said when questioned about people's objections to him and Blaze performing. The Birdie still flying In July 2010 news of the passing of the Mighty Sparrow rocked the world with people frantically sending emails, Facebook messages, texting and calling to find out whether the news was true. It all began when, during a show at NAPA titled Celebrating Our Calypso Monarchs 1939-1980 - T&T's History Through the Eyes of Calypso, Sparrow had to be assisted onto the stage and performed seated. Midway through his presentation it seemed that Sparrow was in pain and ended his performance. The speculation began with people saying Sparrow was experiencing complications due to diabetes and that he was having heart problems. A couple weeks later while performing in Washington DC, Sparrow again had to stop in the midst of his performance. After being examined by doctors at the event, he was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery to treat an incarcerated right inguinal hernia. The Calypso King of the World has been doing well since although on the day fellow calypsonian Arrow died, a radio station got it wrong and announced that Sparrow had passed away, again sending fans around the world into a frenzy. Over the years rumours that Sparrow had died have circulated more than once prompting him to do calypsoes, such as \\\"Sparrow Dead\\\" and \\\"Simpson\\\", tongue-in-cheek style, but at this stage of his life such rumours are no longer a joking matter. New culture at Culture The most crucial development on the local cultural front during 2010 has to be the trouncing of the PNM by the People's Partnership in May. How does this affect culture, you may be asking Well, one of the first actions taken by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar was splitting the Ministry of Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs into separate entities. Thus was established the Ministry of The Arts and Multiculturalism headed by Minister Winston \\\"Gypsy\\\" Peters, former national calypso monarch. A stand-alone ministry for culture had been a longstanding dream of people in the cultural fraternity and having it run by one of their peers made it all that much better. Proving to be a mover and a shaker, Peters got off to a running start with one of his first actions being the freeing up of the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA). The PNM government seemed to have reserved NAPA for events hosted by then Prime Minister, Patrick Manning, UDeCott and members of Manning's administration. Also only entertainment of a certain ilk seemed suited for NAPA and previous culture minister Marlene McDonald was reported to have said the facility was not built, \\\"for those kinds of things\\\" when approached by president of the National Chutney Foundation, Vijay Ramlal to access NAPA for a chutney music event. Under the stewardship of Peters, NAPA has served as the venue for diverse events including comedy shows, calypso concerts, a children's rapso event, the hosting of a temporary museum displaying the skeleton of the T-Rex named Sue, a Divali ballet, pan events, the International Soca Awards and even a valedictorian function or two. Some people have raised the pre-election claim by the People's Parliament that there were too many flaws, requiring some $80 million in repairs, for NAPA to be of any use. They wonder how is it the facility is now suitable to be utilised for so many events of such diversity, especially since there were no visible upgrades carried out on the facility. Back to the Savannah Possibly the most exciting cultural news in 2010 was the announcement of the return of the Parade of the Bands to the Big Stage at the Queen's Park Savannah, Port of Spain, for Carnival 2011. This news was received with unanimous approval by all stakeholders of Carnival. The beloved North Stand will return to its original spot, while the temporary stand that replaced the Grand Stand will be moved opposite the North Stand and be expanded to accommodate more people. The Express was the first to break this news in August when Peters told us he had plans for an impressive structure to house Carnival at the Savannah in the long-term and temporary accommodations for the coming season. The National Carnival Commission is once again under the leadership of Kenny De Silva who previously served up to 2006. De Silva is spearheading the drive to return Carnival to the Savannah and to the people. At the time this review was being written the North Stand was already well on its way to completion. Staying with Carnival, history was made when radio personalities cum soca artistes, Jason \\\"JW\\\" Williams and Ancil \\\"Blaze\\\" Isaac released a song titled \\\"Palance,\\\" which took the nation by storm as everybody from toddler to elder and priest to politician were palancing all over the place, singing the infectious hook and doing the aerobic-styled dance. Pan palang Minister Peters commented this year that there must be bacchanal in Carnival because that adds to the magic of the festival. Well, beyond the misgivings over soca-singing DJs there was some bacchanal in the National Panorama Championship of 2010. Under the governance of new president Keith Diaz, Pan Trinbago sought to breathe new life into the Panorama, which in recent years had seen a decline in attendance possibly because of the demolition of the Grand Stand and absence of the North Stand. Diaz decided that one way to generate more revenue from Panorama would be to charge a $60 entrance fee to the area of the Savannah referred to as the Drag. This is where the steel orchestras assemble as they make their way to the stage. The pannists usually go through their paces here doing practice runs of the tune and in some cases the arrangers tweak the arrangements one final time before facing the judges. Traditionally people gather on the Drag to listen to the bands rehearse and for years had been doing so free of charge. Supporters of the respective steel orchestras, many of whom assist in pushing the pan racks onto the stage also fill the Drag. In fact the Drag had become a mini Panorama in itself and was the place to pass through on the way into the stands or the place to lime if one were not going into the Panorama staging area. Diaz's new $60 fee did not go down well with a lot of people, including some bands and their supporters. The steelbands had a problem with the fee because they felt it would affect the number of supporters accompanying them and assisting in getting them on stage. Others cried foul saying that Pan Trinbago was destroying a longstanding tradition that added to the excitement of Panorama. The Silver Stars Steel Orchestra won the 2010 National Panorama Championship retaining the title they captured for the first time ever the previous year. Playing \\\"Battle Zone\\\" composed by their arranger, Edwin Pouchet with lyrics by Alvin Daniell, the band scored 291 to beat Phase II Pan Groove, which scored 284 points, into second place. Phase II leader, Len \\\"Boogsie\\\" Sharpe was not happy and reacted angrily when the results were revealed. As November came to a close Peters incurred the wrath of the steelband fraternity when he, at an event titled Pan Relay in Laventille said, \\\"I believe that Panorama is responsible for killing steelpan and I make no apologies for that.\\\" President of Pan Trinbago, Keith Diaz was enraged and with the support of his executive and the leadership of some steel orchestras declared war on the Minister and threatened to scrap the 2011 Panorama unless he publicly apologised for his pronouncement of the most important competition for the majority of pannists. Calypso capers After some three years singing one song at the Dimanche Gras to win the National Calypso Monarch title, calypsonians voted in November to return the two-song requirement from 2011. There will still, however, be only one song required in the preliminary and semi final rounds and the finalists will then perform two calypsoes at Dimanche Gras. This decision was a compromise of sorts as some calypsonians wanted to remain with one song, while others wanted to return to two songs. With one song up to the semi-final stage everyone was happy and the decision was finalised in early December after the calypsonians from Tobago cast their votes. A source in the Trinbago Unified Calypsonians Organisation (TUCO) told the Express that Peters also expressed his desire that the two-song rule be returned. The one-song rule served Kurt Allen well as he finally, after years knocking on the door and even leaving the arena for a while, won the title in 2010 with a convincing performance of \\\"Too Bright\\\". Setting the stage with props and actors to mirror Woodford Square and dressed as a vagrant, Allen sang that although the nation has been led by politicians boasting multiple degrees and all manner of academic achievements it is still in a mess. Allen sang that the economy is on a steady decline, crime is rampant, health care in a mess along with many other problems, while so-called intellectuals squabbled over ridiculous motions in Parliament. The former international soca monarch suggested that it was time for a vagrant to be voted in as prime minister, then maybe things would take a turn for the better. After serving as TUCO president for just over a year, Eric \\\"Pink Panther\\\" Taylor decided to contest the 2010 General Elections representing the People's National Movement in the constituency of Toco/Sangre Grande but lost to Dr Rupert Griffith. Taylor did not officially resign as TUCO president and left the organisation in a state of limbo until the executive took the decision to install Lutalo \\\"Brother Resistance\\\" Masimba as president after Taylor gracefully bowed out officially. Beyonce bacchanal After Carnival was the big topic even before the season got on the way in 2010. TSTT announced it was presenting Beyonce in concert at the Queen's Park Savannah on the Thursday following Carnival. Well, the Merry Monarch and segments of the culture fraternity were up in arms and launched protest accusing TSTT of trying to destroy local culture and prevent hard working Trinidadian promoters from earning a dollar. Show promoters cried foul saying people would not attend Carnival events in order to save their money for Beyonce concert tickets of which the cost was as much as $1,600 each. TUCO joined other organisations that said the $10M production cost of the concert was too high, while promoters and other cultural event producers accused TSTT of either cutting back on or outright pulling sponsorship of local events because they were focusing finances on the Beyonce show. The Beyonce concert came off with the headline act delivering a fantastic performance in which she even sang \\\"Palance\\\" much to the delight of the thousands in attendance. Although Beyonce delivered, TSTT and its service providers could have done better as patrons complained of tripping over cables and other debris in dark holes throughout the venue. Patrons also experienced problems in the VIP washrooms and at the food stations where food seemed to run out early on the night. Other shortfalls at the show included the dust that was blowing everywhere, the poor vantage points for hundreds of patrons and the lack of security and inadequate shuttle service for patrons parked at King George V Park and other places away from the Savannah. Making movies The local film industry continues to make strides onto the international market, which was clearly evident at the 2010 Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival (TTFF) that took place from September 22 to October 5 at venues throughout both islands. The festival showcased movies, documentaries, shorts and other categories of video produced by Trinidadians and other Caribbean filmmakers. Hundreds attended showings at venues such as MovieTowne, UWI and community centres in Tobago, making this year's run of the festival the most successful to date. The success of the TTFF inspired the Indian High Commissioner, Malay Mishra to present an Indian Film Festival from November 17 to 23 at MovieTowne. The festival was in commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Indian cinema in Trinidad. Eleven films were shown at the festival, which was also a successful venture. Also taking place in 2010 was the 14th edition of the European Film Festival, which also took place at MovieTowne and featured movies, shorts and documentaries from several countries including Britain, France, Denmark, Holland, Sweden and other European territories. There was also the Animae Caribe Animation and New Media Festival in which local animators got together with their counterparts from North America, Japan, China, Mexico and the other Caribbean islands to share ideas and explore each other's work. Many people were introduced to the local animation fraternity, which has been producing material of international standards for some time now. We remember As the Mighty Sparrow sang, \\\"every year somebody dear gives us cause to shed a tear and mourn for they are gone.\\\" 2010 was no exception as the cultural and entertainment community lost several of its own. Possibly the most impacting loss was that of Arrow who, though not a Trinidadian, contributed greatly to taking the calypso and soca artforms to the world. Arrow on September 16 succumbed to pneumonia brought on by complications from the brain cancer he had been battling for about two years. Born Alphonsus Celestine Edmund Cassell on the island of Montserrat, Arrow achieved international stardom when he released \\\"Hot, Hot, Hot\\\" in 1982. The song made it on to the UK charts in 1984 and a version done by Buster Poindexter in 1987 hit the Billboard Charts in America giving the original version new life and earning Arrow millions. Around the same time Arrow passed away calypsonian and master of ceremonies at the Calypso Revue, SuperLou, died suddenly due to complications brought on by diabetes. A former fireman, SuperLou, whose birth name was Stephen Lewis was also known as the santabranga man because of the way he would refer to sex in his jokes. SuperLou had been performing at the Revue for 15 years. We also lost legendary actor, Errol Jones who passed away on June 21at the home of his niece, Marcia Riley with whom he lived for about 12 years because of a heart condition that required that he be under constant supervision. Jones was a founding member of the Trinidad Theatre Workshop, which was started by Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott in 1959. A former Immigration Officer, Jones got seriously involved in theatre when he was 26 years old and joined a group called the Whitehall Players. His first role was as a young man who was romantically involved with a priest's wife in a play titled The Indifferent Shepherd. Just as this article was heading to print we received news of the passing of Ricardo \\\"Smokey\\\" Mckenzie, owner of the world famous Smokey and Bunty's Sports Bar in St James. McKenzie had been ailing since September 2009 when he was diagnosed with a brain tumour for which he underwent surgery. This was followed by several surgeries, radiation treatment and chemotherapy. An abscess developed in his brain and McKenzie died on December 21 while receiving treatment at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. On the morning of October 22 the soca fraternity was stunned when the news hit that Blazer Dan had been killed at his home by gunmen who pumped several bullets into the artiste. His peers in the entertainment arena and others who knew him were not shocked as Blazer, real name Troydon Cruickshank, lived on the edge as it were. Blazer spent time in jail for his involvement in the death of his brother and had also been arrested for various offences. In the midst of Carnival we lost musical director and longstanding chief judge of the International Soca Monarch, Roland Gordon who suffered a stroke and slipped into a coma following a marathon run of the Soca Monarch semi-finals on January 24. Gordon had, the night before he fell ill, led the judging of over 80 artistes at the semi-finals that ran from 5.30 p.m. to after 3 a.m. the next morning. Gordon was the father of soca artiste, Roderick \\\"Chucky\\\" Gordon who was a participant in the Soca Monarch competition. President of the National Carnival Bands Association, Owen Hinds passed away on November 18 following complications from brain surgery. The veteran masmaker and trade union leader who founded the Contractors and General Workers' Trade Union took over control of the NCBA in 2005 replacing Richard Afong. New York-based calypsonian Lovey passed away suddenly on November shortly after landing in Trinidad for a visit. The cause of death was said to be an aneurism. Born Denise Moore Campbell, Lovey began her career as part of a duo alongside her cousin, Marilyn Williams. Under the name, Lovey and Dovey the two performed backing vocals in studio and on stage for just about every calypsonian who recorded during the 1970s into the 2,000s. In Concert In the way of concerts featuring regional and international acts there were even less such events than 2009, the downturn in the economy being the main reason for the decrease. The Evolution of Music concert that took place at the National Stadium on December 4 was hailed by some patrons as the best ever. We don't know about that, but the show featuring Damian \\\"Junior Gong\\\" Marley, Nas and Jah Cure was for the most part a very good production. While Marley and Nas each delivered very good performances that had the audience singing along and dancing energetically for more than two hours, Jah Cure failed to command the majority of patrons' attention when he came on after 3 a.m. People began to filter out of the venue during Jah Cure's set and by the time he was finished the Stadium was all but empty. The year's most controversial concert was the Localise ITT event that came off at the National Stadium on October 30. The event was presented by The Project Records in conjunction with the Ministry of Sport and Youth Affairs and featured Trinidad-born hip-hop artiste, Nicki Minaj who is at present the hottest female hip-hop act in the world. First there was the controversy over whether Minaj was coming to T&T or not as even after head of The Project Records, Daryl Braxton, announced that Minaj was coming there was an article on her website stating she was not. Minister of Sport and Youth Affairs, Anil Roberts, reportedly flew to New York to meet with Minaj and her management to ensure that she would perform at the event, which she eventually did. Then a couple weeks following the concert, which was featured in a special documentary on Minaj broadcast on the MTV Networks, Member of Parliament for Diego Martin Central, Dr Amery Browne called on Roberts to declare the true cost of producing the concert, which was presented using taxpayers' money. Browne also charged that Minaj used explicit lyrics before the largely youth audience, which Roberts denied. Minaj's management in turn demanded an apology from Browne, claiming he had smeared the artiste's good name. Roberts in the meantime was sent to the Privileges Committee for statements he made in defense of himself, Minaj and the Ministry. Another major event during the year was the Tobago Jazz Experience in April, which featured several top local acts alongside American artistes, Erykah Badu and Chaka Khan. The three-day event was held at the Pigeon Point Heritage Park with several small events taking place at venues across the island. One of the most memorable moments of the festival was Chaka Khan inviting Tobago's hometown heroine singer, Kay Alleyne on stage to sing \\\"I'm Every Woman\\\" alongside her. Foreign Affairs The big shocker for Trinidadians on the regional front was the arrest and subsequent indictment of Jamaican reggae artiste, Buju Banton in Florida for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. Although he was arrested in December 2009 the case unfolded during 2010 when in September the jury, after three days of deliberation, failed to come up with a verdict. The judge declared a mistrial, but the prosecution went before the Grand Jury to have Buju re-indicted and that case was scheduled to begin in December. Reggae music icon, Gregory Isaacs lost his battle with lung cancer when he passed away at his London home on October 25. He was 59 years old. Isaacs was best known on the international arena for his 1982 hit \\\"Night Nurse,\\\" and he was given the nickname Cool Ruler from his 1978 album of the same title.

Korean Ambassador Wonkun Hwang was so thrilled about the number of patrons who turned out to the concert that he said, We never have any problems in getting the auditorium filled when the Embassy puts on a Korean concert.

Located at Boodoo Street, Point Fortin the movement has extended its reach into other areas of Trinidad and Tobago as well as into Grenada and Jamaica. In the five years since its inception, Back-Ah-Yard has presented a number of young calypsonians, rapso artistes, instrumentalists, poets, dancers and others in shows locally and abroad. Many of the members of the Back-Ah-Yard movement give of their time and talent freely to assist young people in expressing their own art, which is a main part of their philosophy and motto, Inspire Someone. Among the projects the group has undertaken is the Nurture the Youth concert, which was attended by 250 pupils from eight primary schools in Point Fortin during the borough's 30th anniversary Borough Day celebrations last year. In November last year, the Nurture The Youth concert took place at the Nest Children's Home run by the Salvation Army at its headquarters at Mannings Hill Road, Kingston, Jamaica. This was done by Back-Ah-Yard in collaboration with the Trinidad and Tobago Entertainment Company. The concert was also presented on April 20 this year at the Fanny Village Community Centre, where 200 primary and secondary school pupils attended.

Joseph, chairman of Pan Trinbago's South Central Zone, said the people of Trinidad and Tobago should be proud of their own culture rather than to promote the influences coming out of North America. Joseph was speaking at the 43rd annual NGC Sanfest Pan Finals, dubbed, De Arts and Culture \\u2013 Essential to Life, held at Skinner Park. Joseph noted that recently when commuting on the water taxi, he did not hear a single track by any local person on the airwaves. \\\"The kind of entertainment on the ferry was not even a chutney, pan or soca. It was all about American music.\\\" He said Pan Trinbago alone cannot do everything to promote the steelpan and commended the promoters who took the initiative to include pan in the Sanfest competition. Even as the ten primary schools and seven secondary schools lined up for the competition, not one arrangement was done with the use of a piece by a local performer. Forest Reserve Anglican Primary School played Lionel Richie's \\\"All Night Long\\\" and retained the title for a third consecutive year. They were followed by runner-up Success Roman Catholic School, which played \\\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\\" and Grant Memorial Presbyterian School which also played \\\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\\" and came third.

But the wonders of modern technology sometimes transmit the stark reality of the cruelty and barbarity of some contemporary human cultures. In one on-line English newspaper there was a brief video clip of a public daylight whipping of a woman by more than one policeman in Somalia. No details were ventured on the \\\"crime\\\" for which she was whipped. She was fully clothed in what I imagine to be an enforced dress code complete with head covering, ordered to sit on the ground surrounded by men, while two uniformed policemen took turns whipping her, not with canes but with long corded whip. The scene was interjected with her screams. As disgusting as the scene was the more abhorrent was the behaviour of the two policemen. When she defensively grabbed hold of the whip, another policeman emerged behind her with his whip and commenced whipping her across her back, both policemen cackling with laughter at her screams. The culture of the country, I suppose. The word \\\"culture\\\"it has so many meanings. The primary meaning however refers to the collective patterns of socially transmitted behaviour of human communities, including beliefs, languages, history, institutions, recreation, arts, science, commerce, laws and governance and so on. It must be noted, however, that cultures may differ markedly and often change. When one hears the word culture in the case of T&T it is more often understood to mean either entertainment of some form or folk and religious ways. But if we accept the primary meaning of the word we must accept that our culture must necessarily include many negatives. Compared with many T&T is supposedly highly corrupt, contemptuous of law, with disgusting road manners, cares little for the environment, littering and degrading, generating much noise and disorder, with most of our national institutions failing in their responsibilities to citizens. The one thing that continues to intrigue about our culture is the theme that Kevin Baldeosingh from time to time so patiently and clinically explains, the broad general correlation between religiosity and crime levels in different countries. For all the religiosity of T&T and the voluminous prayers that fly up to Heaven each day we continue to be a noisy, disordered, lawless, violent and crime-ridden society. We often continue to hear that we are a multicultural and multi-religious society, sometimes even with a sense of awe. On the other hand there is no doubt that cultures, including their subsets, can often bind peoples beneficially and support some measure of order, even as there may be strong divisions in that culture. At the same time there can hardly have any human culture where the process of binding does not involve some degree of coercion, in many cases extremely violent coercion. Religions may do it in different ways, some through the indoctrination from early childhood that may involve threats of one kind or another, or, through religious law that in some cases prescribes the death penalty for individual behaviours that would normally be ignored in other cultures. A Christian woman in Pakistan is sentenced to death for the \\\"crime\\\" of blasphemy the \\\"evidence\\\" being given by a group of Muslim women. Blasphemy is still on our law books as a criminal offence but is now ignored, whereas in Pakistan it may attract the death penalty as was recently reported. Perhaps some will note the irony of blasphemy being in some countries blasphemy against the dominant national religionin T&T against Christianity and in Pakistan against Islam. Perhaps some of the core values of the major religions may be shared, even by atheists and agnostics. These values however are few. It is when you get down to the broader customs, rituals and dictates of these that we see the divisive and exploitative methods of religions. It is not for a moment that I assume that religion or religions will disappear. But to survive in a more liberal world each religion or subset must use every possible device to maintain market share of the pool of available individuals, in some cases with promises and in others with repression. But can any Trinbagonian imagine living in a theocratic state and living under barbaric religious laws. T&T for all its faults is extremely lucky in that its governance has been in the traditions of the coloniser. We are what we are largely because of our history and culture that has been derived from western parliamentary systems that for the past few centuries have managed progressively to contain and diminish the powers of the Christian churches, with governments becoming progressively more secular. But even in some cultures as subsets continue to slaughter each other in the finest tradition of Christian religious violence of the past, now referred to as sectarian violence where Muslims slaughter Muslims, I imagine that some male Trinis might actually have enjoyed the public whipping of a woman. * Julian Kenny, chairman of the Environmental Management Authority, is a biologist and natural history author.

From left, BGTT's Derek Hudson, Viviana Prieto, Gillian Hudson, and Atlantic's outgoing CEO Oscar Prieto share a laugh. Keith Khan, a London-based artist of Trinidadian parentage, impressed a large audience at a one-day conference on culture and tourism held at the Chaguaramas Convention Centre last Tuesday, with a detailed presentation, supported by visual images of the work he has been doing in London and elsewhere, including making use of Notting Hill carnival at various presentations. When I sought to interview Khan, it turned out he was already on the verge of his return trip to London. So he agreed to answer some questions that I e-mailed him. The result is the following interview: Q: Can you provide some information on what you've described as your \\\"Trinidadian heritage\\\" A: My father's family are Khans from Fyzabad, and my mother's are Mohammeds from Siparia. My parents came to the UK in the early sixtiesfor further education. But that means I still have plenty of aunties and uncles in TrinidadI think on both sides of the family there were about 14 brothers and sisters which means there are enough cousins spread throughout the world. Your age Marital status I'm 42 and unmarried. Could you elaborate on your involvement with the London Olympiad of 2012 and other major projects with which you've been associated I held the post of head of culture for the London Olympics for two years. Prior to that I was part of the bid team. My role was to develop a \\\"Cultural Olympiad\\\" with a range of cultural projects to complement the Olympic Games. This is across all sectors, music, museums, galleries, Shakespeare, online. All of these schemes are now being delivered by major UK agencies such as the BBC, the RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) to name a few. I also created a day called \\\"Open\\\" where cultural institutions, places of cultural productionsuch as digital or music studios open their doors to people who might want to learn or participate in the Olympics. I also prepared a cross-cutting plan for young people across the Olympic portfolio as well as a proposition for the \\\"Festival of Carnivals\\\". Prior to this, I was chief executive officer of the Rich Mix Cultural Foundation, which involved managing the start-up and a capital build project worth 28 million pounds. It has three cinemas, with the BBC London Studio as anchor tenants, as well as a number of musical and design-focused creative industries. It was a London and Arts Council initiative to provide a sustainable building in the East End of London. Rich Mix is the first in the \\\"new style\\\" of cultural institutions that goes beyond opera and visual art and looks at the digital generation. Rich Mix is a very cool place, club nights, programmes around sport and very accessible. I had the opportunity to work with Gilberto Gil, the renowned Brazilian artist and former minister of culture, and we sent digital artists into Brazil to help them capacity build their artists, as well as build Brazil's first \\\"Pontos du Cultura\\\" in London. It was really good to create jobs for local people with international aspirations. Before Rich Mix, I was a founding partner of an arts company called \\\"Moti Roti\\\", which is still running. The last show I created with them was Aladeen. It was a big hit in New York and around the world. Aladeen told the story of the call-centre phenomenon in India, within a sophisticated show which integrated live feeds and technology on stage. Moti Roti is currently engaged, under the directorship of Ali Zaidi, with a range of film and food projects between India, Pakistan and the UK. I'm quite proud this company has been a vehicle for 14 years of a vast range of cultural projects, including the Commonwealth Parade for the Queen's Golden Jubilee and the show Moti Roti, which was the first Bollywood musical on stage. And that was back in 1991! What was the main purpose of your return home this time around And when are you likely to visit us next I was a guest of the Ministry of Tourism; Minister Joseph Ross invited me to share my knowledge and expertise about how culture and creativity can be used to diversify T&T's tourism portfolio. This agenda is one Josanne Leonard has been working on for a number of years now, and I hope Trinidad and Tobago does widen its scope. There seems to be a lot of infrastructure, such as the new academies for the performing arts in Port of Spain and San Fernando. It will be important that the vision for these are placed on the world stage, as well as a local resource. They will need great content and should be mapped into a long-term strategy, particularly considering the opportunity the Caribbean hopes to exploit through the Special Protocol on Cultural Cooperation in the EPA signed with the EU. Trinidad and Tobago has an abundance of cultural assetsa rich cultural heritage, pan, Carnival, amazing food, design and digital, and I hope the Government and State-purpose agencies can work together to ensure the country capitalises on this. The conference organised by Josanne Leonard was amazing. It was interesting how an international consultant of Caribbean heritage and home-grown regional consultants were combined to contribute to these important discussions. It was a brilliant stroke by the ministry because often we rely on \\\"others\\\" and not ourselves to validate our development and business agendas. The minister gets full marks for using our intellectual capital. The conference also confirmed in my mind that there is such a strong series of tangible opportunities that need to be capitalised on as a joint folio between your cultural and tourism ministries. Last year, I did a similar visit to Australia, and there (over a five-day period), I visited two cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and spoke to the city, the state and a range of local artists. Three presentations per city! And at all levels. This was under the auspices of the Australian government and the Australia Arts Council. They have clearly listened to some of the propositions, and as a result, I will be developing artistic projects with and from Australia. Let's hope that Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean does the same thing. What is your current status Over the past two years with LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games), I stepped away briefly from my creative practice as a director/artist to get right under the skin of the arts ecology to try and create wide opportunities for artists and other creatives under the Cultural Olympiad banner. I was happy to do that because it gave me an intimate knowledge of working in the wider governmental area. Now, the time is right for me to move back into the creative work. As such, I have created a new company called D Lime, which is currently developing a range of arts and entertainment projects and ideas. At the top of the list is an accordion of programmes and events focused on the Caribbean. These include a big musical and theatrical spectral, an orchestra exchange (with steelband), film and fashion exhibitions and some amazing music concerts. Another current project is a collaboration with the Department for Climate Change (DECC) to identify how artistes can really bring alive this crucial issue of climate change to a wider audience. I've also been working as part of an international steering group for the Commonwealth Foundation, under the chairship of Baroness Lola Young, preparing a Declaration on Culture and Development for the CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting) in November. If I am lucky, I will be back home in November for that announcement. You said at your presentation at the tourism conference that you didn't see enough Caribbean products that could live up to \\\"international standards\\\". What sort of products were you referring to Could you elaborate on that And what do you think can be done to improve this Having been involved in the arts in London for a 20-year stretch, I have seen diversity projects come and go. I'm not talking about the commercial music success of artistes like Eddy Grant, Bob Marley, Billy Ocean and others like Shaggy, Sean Paul and Rihanna. Or even literature (of a particular era) where the region has made such a great impact but has not been able to realise more mainstream appeal for a number of reasons, including distribution and access to venues. From my own experience, a lot of small, locally-focused pieces come in from the region, and often, they are sold to local diaspora audiences. While these are crucial markets, (plural because the community is fragmented), I still live to see real crossover, high-end, well-delivered cultural projects. I would like to see a range of contemporary artistic outputs that reflect the Trinidad and Tobago I know, and not just heritage or Carnival projects which are not well funded or promoted and, thus, are not able to cross over. I believe that Caribbean work needs to be better produced and curated, so it can sit proudly along other countries that are doing so much to promote their cultures. For example, look at Nigeria or India, both countries have really created such a range of exciting projects that have completely shifted the global perception of these countries. I believe the time is ripe for the Caribbean region to create some major shows that can sit and run for seasons in the West End or Broadway. Really sophisticated music projects that can validate our steelband alongside orchestras, so the world can experience what the Caribbean offers. Much of what comes to Europe from the region sometimes compounds stereotypes. The exception seems to be visual arts where some truly breathtaking artists have been profiled. Of course, all of this depends on Trinidad and Tobago itself making a sea change jump in developing this. The government has to support artists with enough freedom so that they are given the power and condition to create. Artists have to be critical and focus on doing great work, and the industry professionals to market and promote must be engaged. My goal with D Lime is to create this artistic and business bridge between the Caribbean and the UK. Do you work with Trinidadians in London There are Trinidadians everywhere! At the Olympics, there are a few Jamaicans in high positions. For many years, I have worked with carnival in Notting HillYaa Asatewaa and South connectionsso I've worked with some great Caribbean talent that way. What is the Trinidad and Tobago image like out there in London Has our virulent crime rate been spoiling or affecting that image in any way I think it needs a bit of a makeover. The Tobago attacks have really dented the view in the UK, and Trinidadian security issues need to be resolved. Within the artistic communities, however, I think there is a good view and excitement, even about the creative imagination and talent that exists, so it would be a shame not to use this right now. Profiling T&T and the region through its culture is really the leap that needs to be made now. With reference to the 2012 cultural programme in which you said you wanted to have a major Caribbean input, could you explain what this is all about And what kind of \\\"cultural input\\\" you will be looking for The athletic prowess of the Caribbean will be very present throughout the Olympics. The world is on fire with Bolt, Thompson and the Caribbean posse of athletes. At D Lime, we want to work with Caribbean artistes, creatives and ministries of culture and tourism to explore this brand using Caribbean music, digital media and projection, and spoken word and dance. And we hope to incorporate archive media by documenting everything we do, so it is part of a very contemporary performance. At present, D Lime is in discussion with a top multi-arts venue in London to produce a major exhibition focused on Caribbean aesthetics (fashion, film, art, architecture, music etc). It will include a music exchange and artistic capacity-building between London and the Caribbean. This is looking to 2012 with a series of smaller events in the run-up to the Games. The goal is to present these highly-polished and well-produced events, exhibitions and shows brought together with the best of talent from the region, under my artistic leadership. I'm really excited about being able to use years of artistic and business contacts and networks to brand T&T and the Caribbean, given the window of the Olympics. Now it's just for regional governments and businesses to move more decisively, understanding that the rest of the world plans ahead strategically. While the Caribbean is late, there is a lot that can be achieved with the right support because T&T and the region is playing catch-up! What advice would you offer to young people in general and young artists in particular Make sure that you focus on excellence in creativity or whatever it is you do; be digitally visible and look at developing markets outside of Europe and North America.

Whatever was announced in the nine paragraphs devoted to the \\\"Creative Industries\\\" consisted mainly of proposed tax incentives and duty free allowances for investors in the arts, entertainment and culture arenas and also included the architectural design and software industries. Howai said the Government is seeking to establish Trinidad and Tobago as a premier film and television production centre and will therefore expand whatever incentives towards achieving this are already in place. At present, the main incentive is a cash rebate of up to 35 per cent to film producers using Trinidad and Tobago as a location, but this has not brought in as many foreign filmmakers using here as a location as was hoped. There is also a tax break of 150 per cent up to $2 million for investment in local films and investment in other local endeavours by corporate or private entities. This, however, is yet to be exploited as the forms and certificates to obtain this are not available. Howai's proposal of a new incentive takes the form of a tax deduction for international filmmakers as well as local producers, which is similar to the tax incentive that is already in place. The Minister proposes to implement this by January 2013, saying he hopes it will encourage those involved in the various creative industries to develop their skills and products to world-class standards. \\\"To boost the film sub-sector I propose to expand the current incentives which are currently available to the film sub-sector. We have now put in place the infrastructure for expanding and developing the Arts and Creative Industries. The performing and visual arts, the literary and fashion industries, architectural design and software industries are all being encouraged to become world-class. The culture shift to arts and creativity would mean not only having world-class artistes but also mean that such artistes would have sustainable livelihoods,\\\" said Howai. \\\"Effective January 1, 2013, I propose to implement for persons in the creative industry, the following tax incentives currently available to sponsors and producers: 150 per cent tax deduction up to a maximum of $3 million for the corporate sponsorship of nationals in the local fashion industry; 150 per cent tax deduction up to a maximum of $3 million for the corporate sponsorship of audio, visual or video productions for the purpose of local education or local entertainment; and 150 per cent tax deduction up to a maximum of $3 million may be claimed by local production companies in respect of their own productions,\\\" he added. There was no mention of investment in the construction of much-needed new performing venues for theatre, concerts or other performing arts. Howai did, however, say a Ramleela Centre will soon be established and this \\\"with its street theatre, will contribute to the continuing development of the arts and culture of our cosmopolitan society\\\". The Ramleela Centre in question is to be constructed at the Divali Nagar site in Chaguanas where training will be provided to people wishing to participate in the annual Ramleela street theatre. However, this is only one of other such venues that the recently-incorporated National Ramleela Council intends to establish. Other incentives towards investment in the creative industries and arts and culture arena include the zero rating of Value Added Tax and duties on the importation of equipment and material, these to be determined by the Government. \\\"During the fiscal year 2013, the Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment will collaborate with the Chamber of Commerce to establish the necessary guarantee with the Comptroller of Customs and Excise in order to facilitate relief from customs duty under the carnet system, for persons in the creative industries. I propose to implement for persons in the creative industries, in particular the film industry, a regime to allow them to import into Trinidad and Tobago equipment and film-specific goods duty free,\\\" said Howai. \\\"I propose to implement for persons in the creative industries, the zero-rating of Value Added Tax on machinery and equipment. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Investment will collaborate with persons in the creative industry to determine the goods that should be zero-rated,\\\" he said. Bruce Paddington, founder of the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival and respected filmmaker, told the Express he is happy over the adjusted incentives and looks forward to local companies deciding to invest in film production. He said he would have liked the cash back to have been increased from 35 per cent to 40 per cent, but he is still pleased with what has been offered and proposed by Minister Howai. \\\"This one is good, very positive. That's what the stakeholders have been asking for the removal of Value Added Tax and duties on lights, cameras and other equipment. They will have to do the regulations, but this is a dream come true for the local filmmakers. \\\"I am also happy that the limit on the tax break has been raised to $3 million and I am hopeful that this will stimulate the private sector to invest in local filmmaking. I would have liked to see the cash back raised to 40 per cent and possibly linked to the use of local labour and talent. But I'm thankful,\\\" said Paddington.

The Department of Creative and Festival Arts at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine, on Friday hosted the second edition of its annual THNK conference at the Faculty of Engineering. The conference series examines various facets of local culture, festival and performance arts and explores how can they be effectively employed towards the social, aesthetic and financial benefits of the people. Conceptualised by cultural researcher Dr Suzanne Burke, THNK also dissects Government policy on culture, identifying areas where there may be shortfalls and things that may have been overlooked. Through panel discussions and lecture presentations, ideas are compiled and documented. The papers are made available for researchers and those responsible for formulating policy on the local entertainment industry, culture and festival arts. At the opening session of this year's THNK, the keynote address, titled \\\"The Role of Culture in Caribbean Development\\\", was presented by Jamaica's Director of Culture, Sydney Bartley, who is hailed as a guru of culture throughout the Caribbean and beyond. Bartley noted that, throughout the Caribbean, influences from Europe and America overpower the cultures of the islands, overshadowing the identities of the peoples. In one of his examples of this, Bartley quoted Bob Marley's \\\"No Woman No Cry\\\" to show how the people have been changed by invasive foreign influences. \\\"I remember when we used to sit in a government yard in Trench Town. And then Georgie would make the fire light, log wood burning through the night. Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you,\\\" sang Bartley, who was joined by some in the audience. Bartley then explained that Marley's lyrics referenced what life was like in the Caribbean then when men, elders and youth alike used to sit together and reason. He said women did not cry when men sat and talked, conversed, worked things out instead of shooting one another, even in hard times. When men sit together and observe women don't cry, Bartley said. Bartley also likened the lyric on sharing the cornmeal porridge to the days when neighbours shared a cup of sugar and other things with one another. Society now teaches people to lock into themselves and not interact with their neighbours, he said. Bartley said community living was how the slaves brought here survived mentally because, after the entire day in the fields, at night they ate together in the barrack yard and shared stories, drummed and danced. Bartley said the two things Caribbean people excel the most in, sport and culture, are designated as extracurricular activities. He said this is the biggest failure of the Caribbean education system and even went on to knock the university system, saying it continues to put the proverbial cart before the horse where sport and the arts are concerned. Bartley said if an artiste such as Machel Montano were to decide to pursue university studies here in the Caribbean now he would have to start at the beginning in spite of his years of success and achievements. The right thing to do, Bartley said, would be to allow Montano credits for what he has accomplished throughout the years he has been doing his music. Bartley said the system has to be changed to serve the people of the Caribbean specifically so we can enjoy the maximum benefits of what we possess. Bartley said nothing cultural has ever come out of universities because it's the grassroots people who have created their cultural identities. Therefore, said Bartley, any government-formulated cultural policy and cultural education plan must consider the cultural identity of the people. Bartley said how the people through the ages have healed themselves using herbs and the things of nature, to how they made use of limited financial and other resources, has shaped the culture and seen them survive. An interesting moment in Bartley's speech was his invitation to the participants to join him in singing Bob Marley's \\\"Redemption Song\\\", which everyone did heartedly. This Bartley did to drive home the point that it is by remembering who we are as a united Caribbean people that will make us prosper. Bartley also in his presentation celebrated the music of the Mighty Sparrow and David Rudder as artistes who, like Marley, have helped the Caribbean people sing their own songs despite being bombarded by foreign cultures.

Hosted by the St James Community Improvement Committee, producers of WeBeat, the event is this year in honour of Dr Michael Alleyne and Mannie Dookie. Alleyne is the widely acclaimed architect of the present national education system which included the creation of the Junior Secondary School and the \\\"double shift\\\" system. He was the vice-principal at St George's College, principal at Tunapuna Government Secondary School and founding principal of South East Port of Spain Government Secondary School. Dookie was probably the most famous Trinidad and Tobago athlete of his time and his name will remain in the history of local athletics because he was a top-class long-distance runner and because he was a pioneer, the first athlete to represent the country in international athletics. One of the things that became his trade mark was that he never liked running in shoes for which he became known as \\\"the bare-footed runner\\\". The awards ceremony begins a week of activities and events celebrating the accomplishments of the people of St James and also providing a platform from which residents can display their skills, talents and even business acumen. There will also be public forums and discussions on the history and development of the community as well as informative sessions on disaster preparedness open to the general public. The St James Amphitheatre will be the venue where a number of cultural shows, some free to the public, others requiring admission prices will take place. On Sunday for instance there will be the WeTreat at the Amphitheatre where children 12 years old and under from the area will be provided with refreshments and also be treated to various fun activities and be entertained by performers including several steel orchestras such as St James Tripolians, Xcite Steelband and Scrunters Pan Groove. On Wednesday there will be a concert titled, Caribbean Beat featuring Pelham Goddard and Roots with special guest, reigning International Power Soca Monarch and National Road March Champion, SuperBlue who will himself have a couple of surprises in store for the patrons. The following night will see the show titled, Pan Explosion taking place at the same venue where Republic Bank Exodus, Solo Harmonites with pianist, Louis Nurse, White Oak Starlift and the St James Tripolians steel orchestras will perform. The always popular, We Vintage Kaiso show comes off at the Amphitheatre on Friday with performances by Baron, Stalin, Scrunter, Ras Kommanda, Bally, Explainer, Johnny King and Poser, with Nikki Crosby serving as host. The following night will see the grand steelband parade along the Western Main Road beginning at 7 p.m. and ending at 2 a.m. There will be 16 steelbands from across the island participating and people are invited to come and jump up to pan music all night and even wear their Carnival costumes if they please. The line-up of steel orchestras includes: RBL Exodus, Cal Invaders, Trinidad Pan Connoisseurs, White Oak Starlift, Petrotrin Phase II Pan Groove, Rhapsody, Valley Harps, Humming Bird Pan Groove, Old Tech Steel Orchestra, Scrunters Pan Groove, St James Tripolians, Carib Woodbrook Playboyz, Musical Gems, Havard Harps, Brimblers, La Creole Pan Groove and Longdenville Claytones. WeBeat 2013 comes to a close on Sunday with the WeFilm Night at the Amphitheatre from 7 p.m. This is being presented in collaboration with the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival. Other events taking place during the week includes the Health Day on Monday, the WeTalk Sidewalk Historian Talk Show on the same day at the Amphitheatre from 7 p.m., and the WeBeat Football Game on Wednesday at the St James Police Barracks. The Arima Fest 2013 opened yesterday with an art exhibition titled, A Collector's Dream at the Borough's Town Hall. This will run until June 24. The three months of activities are in celebration of Arima's status as a Borough having been proclaimed 125 years ago. Although a schedule of events has been released by the Mayor's office details on most of them especially the cultural events are still sketchy for the most part. Among the main events of Arima Fest is the Miss Arima Pageant Royale on July 13 at the Arima New Government Primary School in which several young women from Arima and environs will compete to be crowned Miss Arima and reign over the festival from that night. The art of box cart making and driving was at one time very popular in the Borough and occupied much of the time of children during the Easter and August vacation periods. The Borough Counsel is reviving this and will host a Box Cart Derby on July 14. The following Sunday, July 21 will see a Grand Arima Fest Food Fair taking place at the public car park near the Velodrome. Booths will offer a wide assortment of foods including dishes from the First Peoples (Carib) Community as well as from residents from the Borough's Spanish, East Indian, Chinese, Syrian/Lebanese, African and Creole heritage communities. This has, since its inception about three years ago, become one of the very popular events that features not only great food, but live entertainment. There is also always a tasty selection of chows including mango, pineapple and plum. Of course the main event is the Carib Santa Rosa Carib Festival on August 25, which draws people from throughout the island including Tobago. Arimians living abroad also come home from at least the week before to be a part of this tradition. Other events during Arima Fest includes the Arima Parangrama (July 26), Cannon Blast (August 1), Military Parade (August 4) and the Street Festival with Steelbands (August 10).

CROP KING: Gabby performs \\\"Ole Ashe\\\" to win the 2010 Barbados Calypso Monarch title at the Pic-O-De-Crop finals. Trinidadians for decades made little of the carnivals in the small islands saying those festivals can't compare to the greatest show on earth, Trinidad Carnival. The stakeholders of Trinidad Carnival now fear that other territories, including other Caribbean islands, are producing carnivals that seem more attractive to people around the world. The Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism, National Carnival Bands Association and Trinidad and Tobago Entertainment Company are now seeking to get Carnival back on an even keel after several years of a downward spiral. They are also working on branding all Trinidad-styled carnivals around the world as originating in Trinidad. Hopefully it's not too little, too late. One example of Trinidad Carnival being beaten is the Pic-O-De-Crop National Calypso Monarch finals in Barbados during the just concluded Crop Over celebrations there. The show took place at the Kensington Oval and was attended by over 12,000 people. The venue was completely rebuilt for the 2007 Cricket World Cup tournament and is a state of the art sport facility that is also used for cultural events. The Pic-O-De-Crop was produced by the Barbados National Cultural Foundation (BNCF), which employed the best resources available to produce a show designed to be broadcast live and recorded on DVD. The calypsonians performed from on a large domed stage with the latest in lighting and video effects technology that was used to enhance every moment of the show. The sound system was also top of the line and as soon as there were any problems the crew dealt with them so the performances were not severely affected. There were 10 finalists in the Pic-O-De-Crop finals, each singing two songs. The majority of calypsoes were political commentary, with a couple gospelypso and social commentary in the mix. There were also calypsoes attacking Red Plastic Bag who was defending his title on the night and if he had won would have set the record for capturing the title ten times. In fact, the calypsonian that placed second, Adrian Clarke who was one of the two competitors the majority of patrons supported to win the competition sang \\\"No Red Plastic Bag Day,\\\" in which he called on Bajans to go green and stop using plastic bags, especially red ones. His other song, \\\"Crowd Response\\\" was about how audiences at calypso competitions influence the decisions of the judges by their response to performances. TC who was also a favourite for the title sang in round one \\\"Out Of Control\\\" following that up with \\\"Stimulus\\\" in round two. Several hundred patrons booed when it was announced that she tied for fifth place with Andy \\\"Blood\\\" Armstrong. The people booed even harder when it was revealed that Gabby won the title singing \\\"Haiti,\\\" a tribute to the achievements of the Haitian people since they liberated themselves from slavery and French rule in the 19th century. His second song, \\\"Ole Ashe,\\\" was a samba infused calypso most people did not seem to grasp. Gabby took offense to people questioning whether or not the song was a calypso, going as far as assaulting a television/radio journalist, Anthony \\\"Admiral\\\" Nelson during the Cohobblopot show because Nelson raised questions about the song and Gabby's performance of it at the finals. Gabby also got irritated during a press conference held at the Barbados Hilton on July 31 when Trinidad radio personality, Sterling Henderson asked about people's dislike of the song. The nine-time monarch said people who dislike the song do not have an ear for music. Back to the production of the Pic-O-De-Crop; the show ran on time and smoothly despite heavy rainfall during the day. The cricket field and pitch were completely covered by protective rubber matting that allowed the grass to breathe. Hosted by the comedian/calypsonian, Mac Fingall the show for the first time featured only the calypso competition. The King and Queen competition was cancelled because there were only three sets of kings and queens of a quality the BNCF deemed worthy of competition. So it was decided that it was best that the competition be axed-for this year at least.

GETTING HELP: Adrian Barath ON DISPLAY: Indian High Commissioner, Malay Mishra walks Parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism, Nela Khan through an exhibition on the history of Indian cinema. In saris and suits they came, specially invited guests and lovers of Indian cinema for an historic first at MovieTowne, Port of Spain. It was a milestone moment for the Indian diaspora, a people who once had to settle for movies shown in a tent using a Holmes projector now had their own film festival at the premier entertainment complex in North Trinidad. There are very few who may remember, some 75 years ago when the first ever Filmi in Trinidad, Bala Joban captivated and delighted locals starved for a taste of early Indian cinema. Indian movies would later be seen in cinemas, drive-ins and in movie rental clubs, although without subtitles. Unfortunately, with the advent of DVD technology and rampant piracy, Filmi audiences have now shrunk to mere handfuls. The Festival includes the films Dharm, Kanchivaram, Kutty Srank, Gulabi Talkies, Dulha Mil Gaya, Harish Chandrachi Factory, Dev D, The White Elephant, Janala, Haat: The Weekly Bazaar and Little Zizou. On opening night the movie Dev D was shown. It is a modern-day interpretation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's classic Bengali novel \\\"Devdas\\\". In the movie, Dev (Abhay Deol) is the son of a rich Punjabi businessman. He and Paro (Mahi Gill) are childhood sweethearts. But Dev, insecure arrogant, does not acknowledge Paro's feelings and rides her over frivolous issues. Dev is sent to London as a punishment and to further his studies. This, ironically intensifies their love for each other. However when Dev hears rumours about Paro, he shuns her. A broken, hurt Paro turns her back on Dev and agrees to marry whoever her parents choose. On her wedding day, Dev learns that he has been fed lies but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets the wedding take place. Chanda (Kalki Koechlin) has been caught up in a sex scandal. Her father commits suicide and after being disowned by her family, becomes a woman of ill repute. When Dev's path crosses hers, they realise they are both disillusioned souls destined to be with each other. All the films being shown at the Festival are recent award winning films selected from Panorama of Indian Cinema and are drawn from different regions and languages of India (all sub-titled in English) depicting the diversities of Indian culture and society. These are all award winning movies from 2007 to 2009. Indian High Commissioner Malay Mishra said the Festival aimed to show the population of Trinidad and Tobago that films which are made in regional languages also form part of Indian cinema. He had stressed that Indian cinema is not Bollywood and that Indian cinema was far bigger than Bollywood. The Indian film industry is the biggest in the world, with 1,200 movies coming out of the country last year alone. Bollywood's contribution to this figure was just 200. High Commissioner Mishra said he hoped the week- long festival would open the door to many other opportunities including film student exchange programmes between the two countries. Parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism, Nela Khan, said that film is one of the most natural ways to record and document a country's development and its culture. \\\"Culture and art provide an ideal vehicle for tightening the bonds between countries and, as a way to reach out, beyond governments and institutions, to the people. Through film we can enjoy and learn about different peoples of the world as well as their cultural diversity.\\\" She added that the importance of the Indian Film Festival cannot be underestimated in light of the development of Indian music and culture in this country. Khan said both countries, India and Trinidad and Tobago, have had a long relationship. \\\"In fact since 1845 when the first Indian indentured immigrant travelled from the continent in the Fatel Razack to our shores here in Trinidad and Tobago. From these very early years, music and culture have provided a life-line for our people to connect with their ancient heritage and to get a sense of comfort in this distant land. \\\"This fascination with India through the films,\\\" she said, \\\"has led to greater ties and a deeper relationship between our two countries. One of the benefits to this relationship has been the provision of scholarships to our nationals to pursue studies in Hindi and music at various institutes and universities throughout India.\\\" With the establishment of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Cultural Cooperation she said there was no longer a need for nationals to go to India since personalised tuition in the music and arts was now available for one and all.

Scenes from last year's Best Village Trophy Competition. Shortly after independence Prime Minister Dr Eric Williams embarked on a \\\"Meet the People Tour\\\" throughout the villages in Trinidad. At the end of the tour he described the exercise as \\\"an unforgettable experience that brought me in contact with the ordinary people\\\". As the nation's first Prime Minister he said, \\\"all that was needed was to give the energy and enthusiasm I found in the villages the opportunities for self expression and a home in which to nurture the arts, craft and other cultural expressions of our people.\\\" Arising out of the tour he announced a programme called \\\"The Prime Minister's Best Village Trophy Competition PMBVTC\\\". The aim of the programme was to accelerate building of community centres throughout the country, and using these centres to promote the latent talent in the villages. Although he had travelled extensively during election campaigns, he admitted that he had not visited some areas in Trinidad and Tobago, especially in the rural areas.Williams said, \\\"One of the valuable results of the tours was that I was able to know the country better than I did before.\\\" The report on his visit quoted him as saying, \\\"It was not my first visit to L' Anse Fourmi or to Palatuvier. I already knew quite well La Fillette or Brasso Seco, which has always been one of my favourite spots of natural beauty of the countryside. But the tour allowed me to pay my first visit to Aripo a village 'way behind God's back'. All that I could say to the people of Trinidad is that living 'behind God's back' is beautiful.\\\" During the tour, Williams met with village council members, women's groups, youth groups, sporting and cultural clubs, and agricultural credit societies. Everywhere he went there were school children on hand to perform and entertain him. The meetings with villagers were held in school buildings because of the absence of community centres. Williams said the most outstanding problem was the provision of community centres at which the committee members could meet to carry on their activities at different levels. \\\"Against this background the government will select the areas in which community centres are needed. The centres will be standardised, and their size depending on the population they serve,\\\" he said. Williams said another aspect of the tour was the need to organise Village Programmes aimed at promoting self respect and camaraderie. To get such a programme underway he appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Honourable A A Thompson a minister attached to Community Development. The first segment of the programme was the construction of community centres throughout the country.With financial assistance from Texaco Trinidad Limited and Tate and Lyle, the construction of communities throughout the country began. Williams was not satisfied with building community centres alone. He wanted every school to have a library. As part of the vision for the development of the citizens. Williams said while on tour he saw the need to develop libraries in every school. With assistance from Rockefeller from the United States school libraries were established. Thus was born the Better Village programme under the direction of Joyce Wong Sang, his sister-in-law, and cultural activist Norville Fullerton. Wong Sang in a recent interview said, \\\"when the programme started we had no prior knowledge of what form it should take. We started from scratch, we made some mistakes, but by and large it achieved the purpose set out by the Prime Minister.\\\" She explained that \\\"the vision of the PMBVTC was to champion the integrated village concept in and among communities throughout Trinidad and Tobago. It was also to partner with other communities to identify and satisfy their needs through the provision of gender sensitive, quality programmes and services.\\\" Wong Sang said, \\\"the objective of the programme was to empower communities, by providing them with opportunities that will enhance the surroundings in which they live. It was also designed to promote national pride, and to encourage folk art and the upliftment of art in general, as well as identifying historical and environmental sites throughout Trinidad and Tobago.\\\" After serving as Director of the Programme for 25 years she retired. In 1992 she was awarded the Chaconia Medal Gold. for her services in the area of cultural development. Of the PMBVTC Wong Sang said,\\\"Cash prizes were offered in different categories of the competition and the cultural competitions went through different stages from preliminary to semi final and to the final presentation\\\" The competition started in January each year. Its aim was to build preserve and protect folk traditions and facilitate the growth of natural culture in categories of traditional carnival, handicraft, food and folk fair, environmental sanitation and selection of a queen at a show called la reine rive. Prizes were awarded in each category with the overall winner receiving a $200,000 prize La Reine Rive, a popular cultural presentation, is now the longest running queen competition in Trinidad and Tobago. It is open to females between the ages 16-25 years. Many contestants from the La Reine Rive queen competition went on to enter other queen competitions. As Trinidad celebrates its golden Jubilee of Independence, the PMBVTC will play a major role in the celebrations scheduled for August 2012. The theme for this year's festival is \\\"one family, one nation, preserving our heritage, and celebrating our 50th anniversary of Independence\\\".

Binode Bajnath, senior manager, Advisory Services at EY, Shereen Maharaj, Lisa Marie Wallace of Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT) and Caroni (1975) Ltd CEO Kevin Singh. Show promoters are up in arms over recent statements by Minister of Sport and Youth Affairs, Gary Hunt, and they are looking forward to Good Friday 2010 when they hope to make a bobolee of him and beat him mercilessly. Hunt has announced that no further cultural events would be allowed at the National Stadium and Jean Pierre Complex. Last year, he had banned calypso shows, concerts and fetes from taking place at the venue. Hunt did however during last Carnival make allowances for Machel Montano's Alternative Concept and the finals of the International Soca Monarch which both took place at the National Stadium. Since then there have been no major calypso shows at either the Stadium or Complex. Promoter Randy Glasgow said he has not been able to present any concerts because apart from the Complex there were no other multi-purpose facilities in Trinidad. \\\"Hunt does not love this country, the culture or the people because he has so many of them suffering. The lack of shows is not only hurting us the promoters, but also the entertainers, food vendors, and others that depend on events to earn a living. \\\"Because of Hunt, big calypso stars are working in supermarkets and gas stations here and in the United States to make a living because there are no shows for them here at home,\\\" he said. \\\"Imagine, Roy Cape came to me and asked that I promote a show in celebration of his and Black Stalin's 50th anniversary in the business. I planned an event featuring them, calypsonians, soca acts and artistes such as Herbie Hancock and Hugh Masakela. When we approached Hunt for the Stadium he told us that they could be celebrating 1,000 years. Under no circumstances will there be any calypso show in the Stadium,\\\" Glasgow said. The frustrated promoter added that Hunt has ripped apart the synergies created by former sport and youth affairs minister, Roger Boynes, between sport and culture and that he (Hunt) does not understand that sport and culture are the heart and soul of a nation. \\\"What Hunt is saying is that young people with talent in the spheres of calypso, soca and music on the whole have no place in his ministry. He is also depriving taxpayers use of a public facility. Hunt spent millions to refurbish the Stadium, which has not had any event for the past 100 days. Imagine the Jamaican Minister of Sport banning reggae events at their National Stadium. The people would not hear of it. Jean Pierre is our Madison Square Garden, our Boston Garden and Hunt has shut culture out,\\\" Glasgow said. CEO of the Caribbean Prestige Foundation which produces the Soca Monarch competition, Gregory Fernandes, said the Government must reverse its policy on use of the Stadium and Complex because there is nowhere else to hold large events during Carnival or outside the season. He also criticised the newly-opened National Academy for the Performing Arts saying it does not solve the long-standing problem of a lack of adequate venues. \\\"This ban on shows at the Stadium has severely affected the livelihood of artistes and is damaging the soca industry. There may be no Ladies Night Out, Alternative Comedy Festival, Battle of the Sexes or Soca Monarch next year because the promoters have no place where these shows can be held. Until there are appropriate facilities, we need the Stadium and the Complex. \\\"The performing arts centre is not what the arts community had requested. They asked for a venue with a seating capacity of 5,000 seats with two smaller venues of 1,000 seats each and smaller stages for rehearsals and training. The Prime Minister went and ordered a stage costing $10 million for his guests at the Diplomatic Centre when no community on the island has such a stage for the people. And we are a culturally rich and driven nation. \\\"The whole concept of that performance arts centre is flawed because they will have to subsidise shows there,\\\" Fernandes said.

Earlier this month Planning Minister Dr Bhoe Tewarie announced at a post-Cabinet news conference at the Diplomatic Centre, St Ann's that Cabinet agreed to give the green light to D Chin Commercial Development Ltdand Invaders Bay Marina Ltd to pursue the possibility of developing a section of Invaders Bay just behind Chin's MovieTowne cineplex and entertainment centre. Chin and Joseph made separate presentations to the Cabinet and elaborated on their plans which they argued will boost the local economy and will become a driving force for the country's tourism product. The Business Express spoke to both businessmen who shared their ideas last week. Chin's proposal seeks to create what he describes as the entertainment mecca of the Caribbean. The estimated cost of his \\\"Streets of the World\\\" project is $2 billion. Chin showed the Business Express a DVD video of the designs for Streets of the World during an interview at his Telecom Security Woodbrook office last week. Some of the features of the planned entertainment centre include construction of a bowling alley and an ice skating rink. The way Chin imagines the concept is that people will be able to step out of the blistering midday heat and into an ice skating rink. Chin said the country's rich culture and heritage were greatly reflected in the designs of the project. Streets of the World will be constructed between the Gulf of Paria and the MovieTowne cineplex on 35 acres of land. The video features streets which showcase the country's cosmopolitan makeup with the cultures of India, Africa, Syria and China. The plan for the India street has buildings intricately designed showing the temple-domed arches adorned with huge elephant statues outside. Chin said he approached a number of Indian businessmen and made them an offer to set up their businesses from cuisine to commercial spaces on the India street and create a bazaar-type atmosphere. The same concept applies for the streets of China, Africa and Syria. There is also a main street that will feature designs from when the English, Spanish and French governed the country. Carnival Street is expected to include a Berkeley Plaza designed by the late mas designer Wayne Berkeley. Mas designer Brian MacFarlane's presence is also present on the designs for Carnival Street. Chin said there will be a Carnival museum where the history of Carnival and the pan can be observed. He said a patron will be able to enter the museum and enjoy a two-hour walk though the nation's history as it relates to Carnival culture. \\\"I am not a Carnival person but every year up to 2011 they still building a Grand Stand and people complainthat it is a shed. Where's the vision Why has someone not sat down and planned for this country on how to embrace Carnival and showcase it to the world There are many opportunities as to how Carnival can drive this economy,\\\" said Chin. \\\"Where in this county can you go and see and learn what Lord Kitchener is about or Sparrow All this will be part of the Carnival museum,\\\" he added. The children are not forgotten in Chin's masterplan. There will be a Children's street- a place for learning. Chin said international corporation Disney has expressed an interest in the project and willbe partnering with him. World famous Madame Tussaud's (wax museum) and Ripley's Believe It or Not have also shown interest in the plans. All the streets will be linked to a contemporary interactive sporting area where activities on offer will include ice skating, bowling, swimming and racquetball \\\"What about Brian Lara and Ato Boldon Where's the history of their achievements Where can people go and see what we are about, our legacy\\\" asked Chin. Part of the sporting area designs also include a wellness centre for both physical and psychological well being. Chin said another major attraction will be a Caribbean aquarium where exotic aquatic fish will be on display. \\\"If you go abroad, every city in this world has an aquarium. People know of bake and shark in this country- they can go to that aquarium and actually see the sharks,\\\" said Chin. The designs also include a cultural district with a local film theatre for local filmmakers and artistes to show their work. A luxury housing development is also part of the plan. Chin dismissed his detractors and critics, saying: \\\"What is it you are criticising Everything is always negative, they say I am putting up condominiums, they don't even know what the plan is but they are criticising. I am so confident when I drop this there people will be bowled over.\\\" \\\"I want people to know that it's not the government giving me anything, the government is asking for ideas to develop the land, it's me who have to put the money into this,\\\" said Chin. He recalled when he had the vision to create MovieTowne he faced challenges. This year, MovieTowne will be celebrating its tenth year anniversary in business. \\\"We started MovieTowne on lands that were very raw, we developed it into the place that it is today,\\\" said Chin. He disclosed that as part of MovieTowne's tenth anniversary celebrations there will be giveaways- including a car and the main theatre area will be redecorated and transformed into a Jurassic Park theme. \\\"I had a bad experience going to one of the local theatres to see Titanic and after that I started thinking of how I could offer something better to Trinidad and Tobago,'' Chin remembered. Now, MovieTowne has expanded to Chaguanas and Tobago and Chin says \\\"the biggest and the best\\\" will be coming to San Fernando soon, with another cineplex in the works in Guyana. The other developer whose project Cabinet has approved for the possibility of development is Jerry Joseph's Invaders Bay Marina Ltd project. In a phone interview with the Business Express last week, Joseph said his family had deep roots in Trinidad having established businesses like Rossi Sports, clothing retailer Bluegrass as well as investments in real estate. Joseph stressed that negotiations were still underway with the government but he disclosed that his $1 billion plan for Invaders Bay was impressive. \\\"First of all I want to thank the government for accepting my proposal...this will be very beneficial for the country, pre-construction and post-construction, a lot of employment will be generated in terms of labour and I give the assurance everything will be local from constriction workers to engineers. We are a family-owned company and it's 100 per cent locally owned,\\\" said Joseph. His proposal is to create a place where cruise ships, yachts, small boats and other vessels can come to - the sea hub of the Caribbean with first class marina facilities. The construction of a cruise ship complex in partnership with the government is on the table as well. The complex will allow visitors to come into a portal where they can shop duty free, purchase local art and handicraft and indulge in activities laced with Caribbean flavour. In addition, part of the plan involves the construction of a mega-yacht facility where huge vessels from 80 to over 100 feet can come to Trinidad. \\\"Right now yachts of these sizes cannot come to Trinidad because there is nowhere to house them. When they come here they will be bringing revenue to the country and experiencing all that Trinidad has to offer,\\\" said Joseph.

High rise apartments, a convention centre and commercial duty free shops are all part of the proposal. \\\"I can guarantee you this will be something to make Trinidad and Tobago proud,\\\" he said. He proposes to develop some 14 acres of land which will include a 100-room boutique hotel as well as restaurants. \\\"This project will be of benefit to the entire country. Every person involved in tourism and hospitality will benefit- from tour operators to artistes...Countries live off of tourism such as Barbados, St Kitts, St Maarten, even Antigua depend on tourism and this is the direction we must go,\\\" said Joseph.

Dozens of young people, some of them dressed in school uniforms and others adorned in colourful costumes, flocked to Queen's Hall to see the Queen and her husband, Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh. The youths also got an opportunity to show off their talent to the Royal couple during a special cultural programme to showcase the contribution of young people to culture. The visit of the Queen and her husband created a wave of excitement in the normally quiet St Ann's community which came alive with the sound of steelpan music and the colourful splendour of Carnival costumes. The Queen and her husband arrived at the Hall around 10.15 a.m. Inside the foyer, the Royal party was serenaded by 2009 Junior Calypso Monarch, Megan Waldron, who performed Denise Plummers signature tune \\\"Nah Leaving\\\" which set the tone for the high-powered cultural programme that was to follow. The Queen viewed various items on display at an exhibition that was specially designed to showcase local art and craft and other cultural artifacts unique to Trinidad and Tobago. The Queen seemed particularly interested in a floral arrangement designed by florist Joan Wilson who has won more than ten medals at the prestigious Chelsea Flower show in London. Wilson told members of the media yesterday that this was not the first time the Queen had seen her work and she said she was simply \\\"honoured\\\" and glad for another opportunity to showcase the tropical plants which were unique to this island. After viewing the exhibition, the Royal party was then escorted to the auditorium which was immediately filled with the piercing screams of more school children who had been seated there, awaiting fthe Queen. The Queen and her husband were treated to a cultural mix of folk songs, parang music and dances by a number of cultural groups. Before leaving Queen's Hall, the Queen took time out to greet the young masqueraders with a warm smile, complimenting them on their costumes.

In it he stated that the Government should've prioritised the Carnival Centre ahead of the National Academy for the Performing Arts Centre (NAPAC) since our culture is more Carnival-centric than theatre-centric, the fete market is larger than the theatre market, and the NAPAC is wholly unsuitable for Carnival/fete events.I agree that the reasons he stated exist, but disagree with his conclusion. One of any Government's objectives is to develop and/or facilitate improvement of the various sectors of society. Just because our culture is Carnival-centric, it does not mean we should fail to invest in projects that develop other elements of culture, such as theatre and classical music. If the Government only invests in things that are \\\"real Trini\\\", then it will fail to achieve this development objective. While I understand the frustration of the Carnival artists, I cannot criticise the NAPAC for not being a fete venue.The leading fete promoters aren't in that business just for the love of Carnival.If they weren't making a good profit, they'd have used their entrepreneurial skills in some other sphere.So I agree with the Prime Minister's decision to tell fete promoters to build their own spaces. Asking taxpayers to fund the building of fete venues and then charge them hundreds of dollars to attend fetes there is a bit rich.One may argue that the same rationale can apply to the NAPAC, but theatre and concert production is not as profitable as fete promotions, and requires state support for development. I also think Mr Shah and others should widen their views regarding the market for non-Carnival events.The potential market is not limited to T&T residents; it also includes tourists.Not all tourists want to dance for hours 'til the wee hours of the morning.When my friends and I visit other countries, we spend more evenings visitingconcert halls and theatres than nightclubs.If I bring non-T&T friends to T&T, I'm not going to take them to a fete every night, even during Carnival. T&T's culture doesn't offer enough choice in terms of entertainmentit is time we stop limiting our culture to mostly wine-and-jam. I support theatrical artists' requests for more investment in existing venues, such as the Little Carib Theatre. Imagine what that space could've done with the TT$2 million misspent on the legacy flag. Enterprising theatre/concert production professionals should view the NAPAC as an opportunity to develop products that can fit the larger space, that can run for more than a few days and appeal to international audiences (Raymond Choo Kong is good, but bedroom farces with mostly local jokes are a very small part of theatrical art and won't be fully understood by tourists just like they appreciate the musicality of calypso, but can't understand the lyrics). Why can't Brian MacFarlane's conference opening production be expanded into a full theatre piece?Concerts should now be much tighter with the use of the NAPAC's moving stage, which would allow customers to be fully entertained and go home at a decent hour after a prompt start.Why can't local production houses partner with international companies to bring in guest performances?Adults with young children, and those with none, would have a hell of a time watching The Lion King. Now, before you think my points above are presenting a case for the end justifying the means, let me be clear.While I like the NAPAC, and congratulate the Government and others for making it a reality (I hope they've put in parking), I still abhor the fact that allegations of corruption at UDeCOTT have not been properly dealt with.

Just days before Dr Liverpool's statement, Calypso Rose (McArtha Lewis), recognised as one of the female pioneers in calypso music, uttered similar sentiments, only that time, articulating that culture is badly lacking in our schools. What is culture Or what is the definition of the word culture Culture can be defined as the distinctive long-standing practices and beliefs of any country, society or family. In other words, culture is a way of life or the most constant dominating traits, whether good or bad, moral or immoral, in one's life. And what is practiced and accepted as culture in someone's day-to-day life, might be totally alien or even frowned upon by another. Trinbagonians' general viewpoint of culture is anything that involves local or adopted music, dance, the arts, food, festive occasions etc. Other countries however, especially developed ones, would very much appreciate if their technological advancement, continuing improvement of their intellectual resources, admirable behavioural patterns due to education, training or practices, and things of that sort be recognised as their culture. Yes, they have musical and theatrical talents and quite enjoyably engage in them, but they don't label them as their \\u201cculture''. Another country may have a culture of denial of basic human rights and yet another, a culture of inciting conflict. Similarly, among various families there are generational habits that can be easily termed as a culture. One family may have generations of business persons, another may have generations of carpenters, and another musicians, and another doctors, and another school teachers, and yet another, unfortunately, bandits. And while absolutely nothing is wrong with singing and dancing and the arts, we need to clearly and carefully determine what we attempt to define as our culture, more so if we intend to make it a part of our schools' curriculum. And it is in this analysis, we need to understand that our stamped, focused, seemingly predestined view of culture, or the word culture, may very well sidetrack or has already been sidetracking in many cases, our secondary school pupils from focusing on essential tertiary education and further preparation and development towards science and technology, medicine, commerce, industry, law etc. Given our general view what culture is of a theatrical nature, and now that one of our more recognised artistes is making an appeal for this very same culture to have greater presence in our school system and given the current breakdown in school discipline and the significant number of pupils who, after years in secondary school, turn out academically ill-prepared to move to tertiary level, are we really that foolhardy to even consider this cavalier appeal be thrust upon our children even while they make this priceless once-in-a-lifetime step in the attainment of their education It is more than urgent for us to get this misinterpretation out of our collective heads that culture is entertainment. Culture is any habitual way of life, good or bad, within any family, society or country. It can be easily said, the wine of culture, like history, is born out of the ferment of men's hearts. Our culture can be anything and will be anything we make it. We create our own culture. And should this so-called culture appeal into our fundamental education curriculum be successful, we just may begin to see the development of a new culture among our already volatile young people. It is sobering to just think that we once had the Education Ministry tied in with that of culture. And even now, while the culture Ministry is at present tied to the crucial Community Development Ministry, it is being urged to infuse aspects of itself into our education system. Surely, let the people dance their dances and sing their songs in their communities but not during precious school hours. Yes, we are a democratic country, but aren't we supposed to be governed by knowledgeable and intelligent people Let parents and community leaders take any such responsibility. Yes, we are a democratic country, but will our leaders allow a few talented, well-intentioned but misguided individuals dictate the course of our crucial education system To now allow this laid-back, deviating, non-profit routine to infiltrate our already fragile education system and disrupt our children's tutoring, would be virtually burying their academic careers and our nation's future. Considering Trinidad and Tobago's view of culture, in today's world, would you like your child to be well-cultured or well-educated IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

Douglas said: \\\"Race is nothing, but to some people race is everything,\\\" which contributes to the tearing down of the society. He said that \\\"Trinbago\\\" has been fortunate thus far because other multi-ethnic nations such as Serbia and Rwanda have not been able to enjoy their diversity as Trinidad and Tobago has. \\\"We must also reinforce that while there may be a multitude of manifestations, there is only one Trinidad and Tobago culture. We all belong to this culture. This overarching culture includes all the manifestations developed, nurtured and practised by the citizens. Each citizen has the opportunity, in accordance with constitutionally-enshrined rights to freedom of association, expression and religion, to engage in the manifestations of their choosing. But make no mistake, as varied as we are, we are all one,\\\" Douglas said. Stakeholders in attendance included executive members of the Trinbago Unified Calypsonians Organisation (TUCO), Pan Trinbago, National Carnival Bands Association and other cultural organisations representing artforms such as chutney, Ramleela, the theatre and film fraternity, as well as members of the public. While several people commented they were pleased to see a real push towards finally establishing a national policy for culture, many were concerned that nothing will come out of the consultations again. Actress/playwright Penelope Spencer said she and other members of the theatre fraternity had been invited to speak on the needs of the theatre movement before and her suggestions were never acted upon. Other people questioned the Government's wisdom or lack thereof in wrapping up the Film Company and Trinidad and Tobago Entertainment Company, asking what consultation if any had been done in making those decisions. One filmmaker said she had heard of a mega film city being set up and asked how was this being funded and what expertise was being employed in it. She received no answer from the panel, which included Minister Douglas, Director of Culture Ingrid Ryan-Ruben, Multiculturalism Ministry Permanent Secretary Desdra Bascombe and Deputy Permanent Secretary Vel Lewis.

Minister of Arts and Multiculturalism Winston \\\"Gypsy\\\" Peters, speaking at the launch of the National Registry of Artists and Cultural Workers' second symposium, \\\"Towards a Multiculturalism Policy\\\" at the Crowne Plaza, Port of Spain, last week, said: \\\"The Corporation Tax Act was successfully amended, subsequently increasing the tax break for companies investing in the visual and performing arts, from $1 million to $2 million. What this means therefore is that the door has been pushed open allowing for greater returns on investment in the arts by corporate Trinidad and Tobago.\\\" Director of Culture, Ingrid Ryan-Ruben, who also spoke at the symposium, said the increase which was stated in the 2010/2011 budget by Finance Minister Winston Dookeran, came into effect in January. \\\"A company that is sponsoring an artistic workaudio/visual or video for the purpose of local entertainment or reflecting local culture, will be allowed a tax deduction in the year of that income,\\\" she said. She said in the case of performing artistes, the deduction would apply when the work was done by a Trinidad and Tobago national and that national was registered with the Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism or the Tobago House of Assembly. Ryan-Ruben said it was expected that this new legislation would encourage corporate Trinidad and Tobago to become more involved in the sponsorship of the arts. The registry, which is an online database of all artists and cultural workers involved in the culture sector in Trinidad and Tobago, would also provide artistes access to the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) which, in turn, would allow them free movement across the Caribbeanthe CSME certificate mandates that the artists be on a national registry, she also said. She also noted that the European Economic Partnership Agreement provides for entertainers in the Caribbean to access the European market. \\\"And in order to access that market, you must also be registered so the national registry is a critical step for us in moving forward,\\\" she said.

THE 30th Annual Divali Nagar celebrations began Thursday night at the National Council of Indian Culture (NCIC) Nagar site, in Chaguanas with a series of performances. The event began with the symbolic lighting of the Nagar's first deya, a bhajan performed by pupils of the Munroe Road Hindu School and the singing of the Ganga Maa strotram performed by the Hindu Prachaar Kendra. President of NCIC Dr Deokinanan Sharma delivered the opening address and thanked the NCIC executive for their support in celebrating the 30th anniversary. Sharma gave an insight into this year's theme, Ganga Maa and said that the Divali Nagar celebrations has brought an awareness of the Indo-Trinidadian culture and is an event which is fast growing in popularity. Sharma also said that NCIC will partner with other Hindu religious organisations to hold a convention based on the Indian cultural diaspora next year in celebration of Indian Arrival Day. Minister of Community Development, Culture and the Arts Dr Nyan Gadsby Dolly delivered greetings at the event. She praised NCIC for hosting the event which she said, has preserved and promoted an awareness of the Indian culture. The Minister said: \\u201cThe Divali Nagar is a significant aspect of the annual calendar of Trinidad and Tobago. The festival has served to preserve and promote Indian Culture nationally, regionally and internationally. It represents a cultural exchange among our people. This cultural exposition, our Divali Nagar, has inspired persons around the world to revitalize their Indian culture and heritage. Today, similar type festivals take place in Caribbean countries, the United States of America and Canada. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I would like to acknowledge and applaud the work of the NCIC for serving the people of this nation. You have continued to bring awareness of the religious, social and cultural dimensions of the festival of Divali.\\u201d Gadsby-Dolly said that the various themes used for the celebrations each year has cultural significance. She also shared a Divali message. \\u201cThrough your various themes, attendees have the chance to learn about essential aspects of our Indian culture. This year's theme, Ganga Ma \\u2013 Sacred River focuses on the Goddess and symbolises purity. It speaks of cleansing, health and mercy. It reminds us of new life, rejuvenation and victory. They say that it is here, in Trinidad and Tobago, that the Ganges meets the Nile. And so even as we celebrate the sacred river and the festival of lights, we also celebrate our diversity as a people. We acknowledge the attributes of our Aripo River in northeast Trinidad, which is believed to have been connected to the Ganges River over 25,000 years ago. With the upcoming observance of Divali, the Festival of Lights, let us all be reminded of the strength of communal ties, the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, and unity over dissension, and the power of love and hope. Divali reminds us all of the beauty of light and life. It embraces the values and morals which we hold true, regardless of religion or ethnicity and reminds us of our potential as a people. As we uplift communities across the nation, we pray that the light of Divali will illuminate our new journey towards sustainable development. May we always be blessed with the inspiration, creativity, courage and vision for what tomorrow brings,\\u201d said Gadsby-Dolly. Delivering the feature address was President of the Guyana Hindu Dharmic Sabha Dr Vindhya Vasini Persaud. Persaud. Persaud is also a Member of Parliament in Guyana and has been awarded the Medal of Service and an award from Pranav Ashram in Canada for contributions in the field of Hinduism, culture and humanitarian work. Persaud spoke of the Nagar's theme and made the point that women play a key role in society and that Trinidad and Tobago has understood this. She said: \\u201cI think the people of Trinidad and Tobago definitely understand the meaning of ensuring that women have a position that is pivotal to the development of a nation.\\u201d Quoting from Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi, Persaud said: \\u201cIf you can educate a man, you educate but one, but if you educate a woman you educate the nation\\u2026tonight I want to encourage you all to think of women in such a way and in such a light, empower, educate and enable all the women, all the girls, not only in Trinidad and Tobago but the world so that they can continue to be inspirations of all who they come into contact with.\\u201d Persaud praised NCIC for hosting the Divali Nagar celebrations year after year and said that Divali Nagar goes beyond hosting the event but has a deeper meaning, particularly with the young generation. \\u201cAs you celebrate 30 years I encourage you to do it with absolute pride because as a people you have united, you have worked tirelessly and incessantly to make this happen consecutively and it's not just these moments when we share the beginning of every Divali Nagar but it is what is involved. The training of young people, the immersion in culture, their exposure to the wider ambit of Sanatan vedic dharma, their introduction to values and principles and more importantly the sharing of cultural traditions and beliefs among all people,\\u201d said Persaud. Persaud said that if people understood each other's beliefs, the barriers separating them would be broken and there will be unity. She said that to understand what it means to be a global village, means having to reach out to the other. \\u201cI want to encourage you to not confine to what it is you want to achieve, to the borders of your country rather each out to your sister nations across the world. Reach out to the cultural diaspora, build relationships, friendships, share ideas so that we can truly achieve what we mean by a global village,\\u201d she said. Persaud extended an invitation to the people of the Trinidad and Tobago to visit Guyana for its annual Divali motorcade. Speaking with the Express after the event, Persaud said that the Divali motorcade is a tradition over 40 years old in Guyana which is synonymous to Divali Nagar, which is celebrated countrywide. \\u201cI find it very beautiful and I think that Trinidad should be very proud especially NCIC as they have managed to maintain this for 30 consecutive years and it has not been confined to what is was originally and it has been expanded and has achieved so much more by including so many more people from not at home but from across the world and bringing so many people together. Divali is a very unifying festival and I think to have traditions like these definitely brings out that unity that the festival illustrates,\\u201d said Persaud. She also said that the idea of having a Divali Nagar event in Guyana has been pitched by NCIC's public relations officer Surujdeo Mangaroo and may be a consideration for it. Tokens of appreciation were given to Gadsby-Dolly and Persuad by NCIC. In attendance at the opening of Divali Nagar included House Speaker Bridgid Annisette George, Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh, US Ambassador John Estrada, Indian High Commissioner Bishwasdip Dey, and Members of Parliament Suruj Rambachan, Rudy Indarsingh, Bhoe Tewarie and Chaguanas Mayor Gopaul Boodan. The evening's entertainment also included bhajans by Terance Taran Sookdeo, tassa by the Trinidad and Tobago Sweet Tassa Academy and a dances by the Shiv Shakti Dance Group and the Khalnayak Dance Academy.

Hailing from the community of Bon Accord, talented Courtney Potts continues to make an indelible mark on Tobagos culture and history. He has been involved in sports but more significantly in goat racing and drumming. From the age of ten he heard the pulsating rhythms and was so fascinated that he persuaded his mother to purchase his first drum for him. That was the beginning of an epic journey which resulted in the formation of Drummers of Tomorrow, a community based Drumming School. It was founded by him in 1995 and is one of the most dynamic musical groups on the island, offering its audiences a journey into Africas colourful diversity of music and cultures fused with our very own unique musical rhythms. The ten-plus member group which includes some of his elder siblings, performs a variety of styles such as calypso, reggae, inspirational and African rhythms; his talented wife provides great moral support. Courtney, besides being the lead drummer, conducts drumming classes and also makes the drums from fallen trees, bamboo and calabash. He continues to experiment with other genres and the fusion of his music with the steelband has created a unique blend. The group has successfully mastered the tassa and to date the band has provided tassa music for a few Indian weddings with overwhelming response from the clients. As the leader of the group Drummers of Tomorrow, he led them to the World Championship of Performing Arts in Hollywood in 2007, competing against the best in the world. To date they have produced a CD and a DVD and many visitors to several of our hotels have been thrilled with the sensational vibrations of this creative band of entertainers. They were also involved in the Prime Ministers Best Village Competition, the Muhtadi Drum Festival and participated in the Grenada Drum Festival for the last three years. Another aspect of our cultural life in which he is involved is goat racing. For several decades since 1925, the sport of goat racing has been a unique feature of the local sporting and cultural scene. After the traditional Easter weekend activities, the minds of Tobagonians are focused on the compact village of Buccoo where on Easter Tuesday it is virtually a holiday. His first competitive race was at the age of seventeen at the Mt Pleasant Village Council Easter Monday Sports. From his experience of rearing goats he thinks that the local breed of goat, crossed with the imported stock of Alpine, Anglo-Nubian or Toggenburg breed, produces an ideal racing goat. As an owner/trainer he is always exploring possibilities in Tobago and beyond; his goats have also run at the Santa Rosa Horseracing Track on a day dubbed Tobago Day. As to the future, he thinks that much greater use could be made of the Integrated Facilities at Buccoo. There is a Goat Race Owners Association of which he is a member along with a dozen or more enthusiasts. The maintenance cost for a racing goat could be between $5,000 and $10,000 per year and with only two or three racing events during the year, it is highly uneconomical to maintain a stable of goats. He is of the opinion that there should be more events during the year, improvement in the prize structure, introduction of betting and other considerations such as the incorporation of cultural items in an attractive package for both visitors and local patrons. The creative talents of this relatively young citizen are definitely helping to put Tobago more significantly on the international map.

JAMAICA and other member states of our Caribbean Community have long been sharing the applause of nations of the world for the richness of their cultural traditions, including the creative and performing arts. But a mix of spreading mindless criminality and declining moral virtues have combined to seriously undermine long cherished ethical and spiritual norms in our regionfrom Jamaica and The Bahamas in the north to Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana in southern region and across the Eastern Caribbean. Caricom member states now seem locked in a losing battle to a degrading \\\"wuk-up\\\" culture, largely being sustained, ironically, by some of the best known names among our performing artistes and entertainers. Countries like Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, with high-profile cultural contributions, are increasingly challenged by an invasion of immoral behaviour during carnivals and other national entertainment events. They would also be aware that in Barbados, once frequently referenced as a quiet, pastoral Caribbean society with endearing social behaviour and encouraging moral rectitude, is currently on the offensive against lewdness in public life involving adults and children as they do their \\\"wuk-up\\\" thing at the Crop Over festivalBajans' annual mid-year carnival season. Some have become so irritated and demoralised by the constant flaunting of rude and crude sexual behaviour, not only during Crop Over, that they have even resorted to extending blame against their most internationally famous entertainer, Rihanna, for sending \\\"wrong messages\\\" to the youth with the performances of her songs and music. A week ago, in the Sunday Sun of the Nation Publishing Company, a letter-writer (Pamela Cumberbatch) called for the revocation of the honour bestowed upon superstar Rihanna as Barbados's Ambassador for Youth and Culture because her lifestyle was hardly an example to the youth. More precisely, argued Cumberbatch, Rihanna was \\\"abusing the leverage given her to promote this country\\\". I do not know Cumberbatch, whose letter to the editor was published as a \\\"guest column\\\". But the sentiments she expressed clearly reflect the hurt she and other Barbadians feel about the deteriorating moral values in Barbados, with the \\\"Rihanna influence\\\" being a significant factor. So far there has been no response from Rihanna and it is doubtful the Barbados Government is so inclined. Nor does one have to be a prude to concur that in her incredible rise to international stardom, Rihanna's own confessional lyrics of \\\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\\" suggest an attitude of moral rectitude that can hardly endear her to Barbadians, of various walks of life, now increasingly revealing a mix of sadness and anger over declining morals and the penchant for lewdness and conflicts among youth. Objectively, the print and electronic media in Barbadosand elsewhere in the Caribbeancannot be exempted from criticism for contributing to what some cynically view as \\\"the new face of Barbados\\\" where raw lewdness, involving even gyrations of adults and children during the just-concluded Crop Over season can find coverage in both media. For president of the National Organisation of Women (NOW) Marilyn Rice-Bowen, some of these lewd acts captured during Kadooment Day and forwarded for the attention of the police and Child Care Board constitute \\\"child abuse\\\". And she has appealed to women \\\"to respect themselves and embrace their roles as shapers of the society\\\". Long before sections of the Barbados media were being castigated over claimed abuse of press freedom in encouraging lewdness and general decline in moral behaviour by their photo- graphic coverage of Crop Over events, the media in Trinidad and Tobago had to cope with the wrath shown by the people of this Caricom state who rallied against what's better known in Barbados as sheer \\\"wuk-up\\\" culture, down from the waist. Leading media enterprises in T&T, therefore, started paying more critical attention in the editing of television footage and use of photographs in newspapers, with the understanding that those who pride their freedom to engage in lewd behaviour during Carnival should not expect the media to be a party to such acts by devoting coverage to them. Within recent weeks in Barbados, there have been repeated denunciations from various pulpits against the extent of media coverage on disgusting behaviour and unmistakable sexual gestures. I am aware leading media enterprises in this and other Caricom states have a professional code of ethics, or at least basic guidelines, to adhere to when dealing with coverage of vulgarities that so often masquerade as \\\"just having fun\\\" or \\\"spreading body joy\\\". More attention should, therefore, be paid to what representative voices are currently condemning, with the hope of arresting the spreading patterns of immoral behaviour. But do not expect a response from Rihanna to the call for revocation by the government of her status as Barbados Ambassador for Youth and Culture. It would be surprising if Rihanna will have time to even bother about offering a response to calls for revocation of her ambassadorial status. And I doubt the government, which has been making use of her fame to further boost the key foreign-exchange-earning tourism industry, has any such intention. For now, let Barbados Prime Minister Freundel Stuart have the last comment, as expressed in his address to the Caribbean International Youth Convention on July 28: \\\"There are many inducements out there in the world to sidetrack and to ensnare our young people to divert them from the path of right and from the path of good into unwholesome, dangerous and soul-destroying activities... \\\"A heavy responsibility devolves, therefore,\\\", said the Prime Minister, \\\"on the shoulders of our adults to ensure that we take proper care of our young people and be the examples for them which they can proudly and confidently follow.\\\" I have reasons to believe Stuart's sentiment would find endorsement among all of his Caricom Heads of Government colleagues. Question of interest is the related initiatives they intend to pursue to arrest the general decline in social behaviour and moral rectitude.

From left, Mauricia De Peza, second runner-up; Arielle Moses, winner; and Chelsea Mohamed, first runner-up. WHAT comes to mind when you hear the title 'entertainment lawyer' Do the words 'fun' and 'sexy' quickly roll off your tongue Do you imagine someone whose average work day consists of rubbing shoulders and shaking hands with the who's who of the entertainment industry at swanky events Among the many fallacies and misconceptions concerningentertainment law, the twomentioned above are high on the list, says Carla Parris. And she should know. Parris is the only lawyer in Trinidad and Tobago with a Masters in entertainment law. In reality, entertainment law is more complex than we could ever imagine. An entertainment lawyer not only serves as advocate to the creative artiste, whether it's in the field of music, acting or fashion, he or she also deals with issues that are part and parcel of the industry, ranging from intellectual property matters, to copyrights, patents and contracts. In this ever-evolving discipline of law, an entertainment lawyer's work week is more often a combination of tense meetings with difficult personalities and big egos together with long work hours in the office. While there are perks, it's certainly not as glamourous as some would anticipate. However, in the entertainment industry, the role of the entertainment lawyer is absolutely essential, if not crucial. Put plainly and simply, a person who chooses to consult an entertainment lawyer in the early stages of his career is more likely to make the wisest decisions and detect red flags when they arise. On the other hand, someone who foregoes legal advicesuffers the risk of seeing his dreams of a successful career in entertainment, turn into a nightmare. Parris stresses how important it is that people cover their legal bases. Shehas seen first hand the ill effectsthat befall those who neglect to do so. \\\"A lot of times, I've seen in the film and animation industry where people want to get their pilot project into an international company and the contract they have signed with this international organisation is so one-sided and so poor, at the end of the day, they will end up with nothing, absolutely nothing at all because they were so eager to get their exposure, so eager to move forward with this international organisation, that they neglected this aspect of legal input. So this is what I'm trying to inculcate, an understanding of 'come before', view it as an investment into your long-term gain and things will be so much smoother,\\\" Parris advises. Parris has been a lawyer for the past eight years and has assisted clients in the music, film, animation, events management, fashion and broadcast industries to protect their rights and to understand how to leverage their IP assets to grow their businesses. Out of the Marie de Vere chambers in Port of Spain where she operates, Parris specialises in the areas of copyright, trademark, contract, multimedia law, intellectual property and employment law. Parris's passion lies in the arts, but her foray into entertainment law didn't happen overnight. After being called to the bar in Trinidad and Tobago in 2003, she moved to London where she worked in the publishing industry as an editor and features writer for several magazines. On returning to T&T in 2005, her love for creative arts led to her freelancing for E Zone Entertainment. She then went on to work for the Caribbean New Media Group where she appeared on the nightly news with stories about the local arts and cultural sectors. Over the years, Parris has built up an impressive resume. From 2004 - 2006,she served as alegal adviser to the Association of British Calypsonians in London, UK- the only representative body for British-based calypsonians in the UK and Europe. From 2007-2010 she also served as a founding member of theCaribbean Electronic Law Network- the only non profit organisation in Trinidad dedicated to providing free legal advice to citizens. In October 2010, she received her master's degree in entertainment law from the University of Westminster in London. Most recentlysince August 2011, Parris has been employed as a consultant for a Trinidad and Tobago government project commissioned through the United Nations, World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trade Centre to measure the contribution of copyright based industries to GDP, employment and trade in T&T. It would bethe experiences sheencountered while interviewing composers, musicians and others who voiced their frustration of the slow development of the creative industry,that would help shape her career in law. \\\"I came to Trinidad and worked at CNMG for just under a year doing entertainment clips for the nightly news and it was interacting with a lot of the artistes, a lot of people across the board in theatre, music, in film that I realised that the intellectual property framework was completely missing, people were just clueless about how tosell their products, they were getting exploited, left right and centre, being given really shady deals, finalising a deal via handshake, which is all well and good but deals go bad, relationships go sour and so that is why I got into this, and it's no easy task,\\\" she says. Entertainment law is especially difficult, explains Parris, because it is still a largely underdeveloped field in this country, with very few precedents. Parris says she relies on international assistance and spends a lot of her days networking, finding like-minded lawyers in her field who are experienced and could give her guidance. \\\"There is a lawyer here who I work with, Keron James he is a great assistance to me and quite often we work together on weekends hashing out deals and negotiating contracts and trying to figure out how to get somebody out of a bad arrangement.\\\" While speaking with Parris, it's clear that a major bone of contention in the industry continues to be the matter of contracts, or lack thereof. \\\"Deals tend not to be made via contract, things are not put into writing and after the fact, when the product becomes financially viable, then there's quite often confusion... if people would think about the legal aspect of their business and conduct their operations in a professional manner andgo to a lawyer, everything will move a lotsmoother and you would have proper records in place so that if a situation goessour, everything isclear, everything is on paper,\\\" Parris stresses. With so much talk about the need to diversify our economy away from gas and oil, Parris insists that as a nation we must invest in the creative aspects of our economy - which has the potential to rake in millions. She referred to a recent news report in The Gleaner which states that \\\"Jamaicaearned more net foreign exchange from cultural services which includes music, sport and film at US$23 million in 2010, than from services in finance, business, insurance and construction combined, according to newly released Bank of Jamaica data\\\". At present, however, T&T's entertainmentand creative sectoron the whole, falls considerably short of international standards. Parris says the reason for this is simple: Culturally, we haven't viewed the creative sector as something worthy of investment, we tend to think of the economy only in terms of gas and oil. On the topicofdiversification of the economy, Parris stresses that the entertainment industry is a non-traditional sector that has the potential for vast revenues, but if we as a nation were to benefit fully from the creative sector as a whole, anti-piracy laws must be enforced. T&T is party to at least 17 international treaties on intellectual property. Yet piracy remains a huge problem at home and abroad. Pride in local artistes along with a sense of patriotism, Parris believes, should make one rethink buying pirated CDs and DVDs. \\\"It is illegal to buy pirated CDs, it is illegal to go to a show in the stadium, tape the show, upload it onto Youtube and then expect the entertainer to get from point A to B. Every time you takea photo without permission or you download a song without paying, the artiste is not benefiting and then you criticise and say: 'why aren't our artistes getting anywhere',\\\" says Parris. The general sentiment that has persisted is that a career in the entertainment industry in Trinidad and Tobago does not pay and is more of an outlet for creativity rather than a viable career option. Rather than be discouraged, Parris says artistes must be realistic: the entertainment field is a competitive environment, so spend time reading about the legal aspects of your particular trade, understand that it makes sense to have a good, solid team around you, Parris advises. In this current landscape, record labels are downsizing as a resultof the downturn in the economy, soParris encourages those in the entertainment sector to think outside the box. \\\"Apart from performing, there are many other ways that you can make some sort of income for yourself, she says. \\\"Think abot the major stars, they make money from endorsement deals, from synchronisation deals - linking music to film. That's not somethingthat's done in our prime context at all, we have a local film industry. Why aren't we doing deals whereby we are linking local music to a local film, and thereby pushing both sectors simultaneously and giving both people exposure\\\" Parris asks. See yourself as a brand andtake full advantage of social media,Parris advises. She says artistes could take a cue from celebrities such as Kim Kardashian who have built and expanded their brand and fan base with the help of Twitter. In order to grow, the entertainers in the creative industry need a re-orientation of how they view themselves and their talent, Parris says bluntly. \\\"We are holding ourselves back, people are not seeing their talents as tradeable commodities, they're not seeing their creative talents as business products, they see it as a side gig. So if you don't see yourself as someone worthy of investing in, then how is the wider world going to view you\\\"she asks. It's going to take some time beforethis nation's creative sector reaches its true potential, says Parris.In the meantime, T&T is bursting with talent which deserves a chance at being heard, instead of being sucked into a deep black hole created by poor decisions and messy deals. It will take a lot of work, concludes Parris,but with the right investment bythe private sector and the government - the creative sector can grow into a booming viable industry.

A star-studded private celebration of Chanel. The triple tsunami of global capitalism that pounded socialist Cuba this month has spawned a fierce debate about the downside of detente with the United States. Artists, writers and intellectuals who believe deeply in Cuba's opening to the world are questioning their government's management of an onslaught of big-money pop culture. On an island that prides itself on egalitarianism, sovereignty and its long record of outsize accomplishments in the arts, many are openly critiquing opaque deals with multinational corporations seeking picturesque backdrops for car chases and summer frocks. \\\"The essence of the thing is that we're a country with a particular history that has a particular culture. We have to be conscious of those values and keep them in mind when it's time to negotiate,\\\" said Graziella Pogolotti, an 84-year-old cultural critic who wrote a long editorial in state media calling for deeper thinking about Cuba's dealing with international entertainment brands. Cubans began complaining soon after the eighth installment of the hugely profitable action movie franchise \\\"Fast and Furious\\\" began filming in Havana. On street corners and in living rooms, working men and women questioned how they would benefit from a production that was causing seemingly endless traffic jams \\u2014 a new phenomenon in a city where relatively few people own cars. Then came the arrival of the Adonia, the first U.S. cruise ship in Cuba in nearly 40 years. Around the world, television viewers watched prosperous-looking Americans greeted by trays of rum drinks and Afro-Cuban dancers in skimpy Cuban flag-patterned bathing suits. For many Cubans, it was a spectacle uniting the worst exotic stereotypes about their country with disrespect for a symbol of independence. Within 24 hours, the world's rich and famous were lounging on park benches on the majestic, colonial Prado boulevard as slender models showed off outfits by the French luxury label Chanel that seemed inspired by pre-revolutionary Cuba. The mostly foreign audience arrived in specially hired classic American cars. Havana residents had to watch from behind police lines more than a block away. A year and a half after the U.S. and Cuba declared detente, and a month after President Barack Obama visited Havana, it seemed as if the world of global commerce and entertainment had finally landed on Cuba with full force. Many Cubans were exuberant. Avid consumers of U.S. culture in pirated TV and films, they welcomed the sight of movie stars walking the streets of a country that often feels cut off from the outside world. Many said they were hopeful that the millions spent on the productions would improve life for those who haven't yet benefited from the post-detente surge in tourism. But people's personal offense at being held far from the events began translating into skepticism about whether their country's hot new status would help improve their lives. \\\"I love that the world is looking at us, that the world is fixing its eyes on Cuba, but up until now I don't see that it's really bringing real, concrete benefits,\\\" said Alberto O'Reilly, a 22-year-old librarian who was kicked off a street corner by police as he tried to watch the Chanel show. For some Cubans, the flashy spectacles recalled the pre-revolutionary days when wealthy Americans viewed Cuba as a sexy tropical playground, ignoring the problems of the people who lived on the island. Fidel Castro famously shut down the country's casinos and most sordid nightclubs when he came to power. \\\"It's very important that we don't give the \\\"Ugly American\\\" reason to come back,\\\" said Desiderio Navarro, a widely respected critic and editor. \\\"We're not in the 1930s or '40s and we mustn't repeat the errors of the past.\\\" The public backlash began the day after Chanel's show, with a remarkable blog post by Sergio Gomez, the international editor of Granma, the Cuban Communist Party's official newspaper. Gomez, 28, took to the blogging website Medium with a lacerating post that called on Cuba's leaders to better explain their dealings with the likes of Chanel and NBCUniversal, the entertainment giant that shot \\\"Fast and Furious\\\" in Havana. \\\"It would be hard to overturn a revolution, much less Cuba's revolution, by filming of a Hollywood blockbuster, helicopter included, or by closing the Prado boulevard to show off the cruise collection of a famous French brand,\\\" he wrote. \\\"But the way in which these events are interpreted, in the context of a process of change that will define the destiny of 11 million people, can subvert the social consensus that the country has maintained for more than half a century.\\\" \\\"There were many people on the Prado trying to see the show,\\\" he wrote. \\\"But even more in the stores trying to find basic goods with recently reduced prices, like chicken and cooking oil.\\\" Pogolotti was next. In an open letter in the state newspaper Juventud Rebelde, or Rebel Youth, she acknowledged that Cuba needs \\\"commerce, investment and tourism in order to confront the economic difficulties that afflict us.\\\" \\\"But the demands of reality can't make us forget that we must, above all, fight for national sovereignty,\\\" she wrote. \\\"That means we must, in every case, set the rules of the game. It's everyone's responsibility to demand respect for the dignity of our citizens.\\\" Three days later, Juventud Rebelde published an unusually confrontational interview with Roberto Smith, the president of the government film institute that deals with foreign productions. Saying \\\"a singular debate is occurring about the filming of 'Fast and Furious,'\\\" interviewer Onaisys Fonticoba Gener asked Smith how much NBCUniversal was paying to film in Cuba and where the money was going. Smith deferred the first question and assured readers the money would go to support Cuban filmmakers. Cuba's official Union of Writers and Artists also complained that the cruise ship reception offered \\\"a deplorable sight to those visiting our country for the first time.\\\" Still, Cuba doesn't appear to be running out of chances to get it right. Michael Bay, director of the \\\"Transformers\\\" movie series based on the popular 1980s robot toys, said on his blog this week that work on the fifth installment was about to begin. \\\"It's been an amazing journey,\\\" he wrote over a picture of a glowering computer-generated robot. \\\"Transformers starts production this week in Cuba.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

BUDDING ARTISTS: Students of the project with the artist. Since 2007, Reva Arneaud, founder and director of the non-profit organisation Personal Student Learning Unit (PSLU), has been dedicated to enhancing the lives of members of her community. Using a tiny space located in the upper level of Aaliyah's Mall on Charlotte Street, Port of Spain, Arneaud, along with a small group of volunteers, has engaged both children and adults in continuing education classes and after-school programmes focused on academics, nutrition, anger management and more. After completing research on art in education, Arneaud has decided to add yet another dimension to the expanding facility, which she refers to as a \\\"development centre\\\". Earlier this year, the centre was sponsored keyboards and pans by the Australian High Commission and in November, Arneaud teamed up with artist Janessa McKell to conduct face-painting workshops with children in the programme. On December 19 Arneaud sought out her uncle, artist Brian \\\"Bydee Man\\\" Joseph, to lecture about his work and to paint a mural with about 15 children in the holiday camp. Joseph will also be assisting with fund-raising through the hosting of an exhibition in January. These activities are the first phase in Arneaud's art in education programme and she plans to expand. Already, she has secured local graffiti artists for a workshop early next year. Arneaud sees art as an avenue to learn more about the children and to broaden their horizons. \\\"Art has such expression. Art opens a whole new era for children. When they draw or paint you can tell what they are thinking or feeling, just like music. Children naturally like colours and this creates excitement and worth in them. They feel proud of their art. It also helps with building focus and attention. You have to have a certain discipline to do art. Children who study art also tend to excel in other areas, but academics is not all. We can't expect all children to be doctors and lawyers.\\\" Providing this additional programming, however, is not the easiest task for an organisation with little funding. PSLU receives the majority of its sponsorship from the Australian High Commission and Angostura Ltd. They also receive donations and encourage volunteers. So when Arneaud was able to reconnect with Joseph, who immigrated to the US some 41 years ago, she was more than happy to find out that he had similar interests in working with youth. . . and that he was willing to help. Arneaud and Joseph were also able to share similar experiences of leaving the corporate world to pursue their passion. When Joseph discovered painting in his 30s, he made the decision to control his own destiny and became a full-time artist. He created the BYDEE people in 1986 and the fictional characters that live in sea shells have became a major focus of his work and message. BYDEE translates to Bringing You Delightful Entertaining Experiences and, according to Joseph, their main purpose is to bring people happiness. Since creating BYDEE, Joseph has worked with numerous non-profit organisations such as Habitat for Humanity and the National Education Agency and has lectured and produced murals at schools throughout the US, including Colgate University, Auburn University and Texas A&M International. \\\"Because my art promotes diversity, inclusion and all things positive, schools have engaged me to speak with kids, teachers and paint murals that promote my message. I think the main focus in schools is promoting diversity. It's easy to promote and people gravitate to it,\\\" he said. Another aspect of BYDEE is confidence building. \\\"What I think is important is that I use art to really help kids build their self-esteem. When I do my artwork I don't paint faces and the reason I do that is because you don't have to be good-looking to be happy. What I found is that a lot of children because of peer pressure or just low self-esteem, they don't like themselves. With my philosophy, painting takes that out of the picture. It's not about how they look but what kind of friend they can be.\\\" Joseph has also written four books with poetry to accompany his artwork and for the last eight years has hosted the Bydee Festival in Austin, Texas, USA, which focuses on Caribbean music, culture and food.

The reigning International Power Soca Monarch and National Road March champion was speaking during the launch of his new song, Borough Day, at the offices of Software Technologies Ltd, St James, on Thursday. I dont talk much, but share my thoughts through music. My focus is soca music for the rest of the world, to inform, educate and entertain. Trinidad has been good to me and, as a calypsonian, I inherited a platform from Cypher, Atilla, Sparrow and am thankful. People say I mash-up the art form with the wave thing, but I know it can stand up. Its all about ideas and not only all about wining and gyrating, SuperBlue said. He said Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is the only one of its kind and not even the carnivals that have been styled after ours are truly like Carnival here. He also said Carnival, calypso, soca and pan can be used to combat crime if only the proper resources would be invested into them by the authorities. We have given the word carnival a whole new meaning. To us it is a verb, a noun, an adjective. All the other carnivals are governed by a parade, they start at point A and end at Point B. Trinidad is different. We have freedom. Trinidad Carnival is a festival of food, of colour, of rhythm, of culture and I can go on and on. Every sickness has a cure and it maybe will not be in my time or your time, but there are answers for everything and calypso and soca can cure crime. The pan is also important and I would love to see 150 pannists playing Rebecca on the road one day. Forget about the 100 players limit, SuperBlue said. As for the song, Borough Day, it was recorded as a tribute to the Borough of Point Fortin where SuperBlue is from. It is also the theme song for Point Fortins Borough Day celebrations, which culminate on the weekend of May 3-5 and is in turn in tribute to SuperBlue this year. The song was composed by SuperBlue and Len Boogsie Sharpe, while Juelio Nelson did the production. SuperBlue said this is only the first follow-up to Road March winner Fantastic Friday and his plan is to release soca singles throughout the year, with the next to come being School Reunion Party. This comeback was frightening for me. Ive gone off the scene and come back before, but this time I saw from babies bouncing to the youth and the elders. People in church say they can sing the song. Music for everybody. You know, people ask me how long I singing. My first note was in the key of life when the doctor slap me. I may not live to see us get a Grammy, but I know we going to get it, he said. Also at Thursdays function, SuperBlue launched his Jouvert band, simply named Water and Powder, which he said will be the biggest and least expensive Jouvert band to ever hit the streets of Point Fortin for Borough Day. He also announced a major event at Coronation Park, Point Fortin on May 4 that he said is a family affair, in which he will be performing alongside his daughter, Fay-Ann Lyons-Alvarez, and her husband Bunji Garlin, as well as his son, K-Rich, and daughter, Terri Lyons.

The more you scrutinise it, the more its solitude and loneliness suck you in like a magnet. It's a young girl. Her back is turned. She wears a black and white striped dress. She appears to be heading into nothingness; hair unkempt. Something is obviously wrong. Who is she What is her story There is much to be said about this amazing contemporary piece of artwork. The painting hangs at the entrance to the residence of the United States of America Chief of Mission, Flagstaff Hill, St James. It is one of eight selected works of local artists which aficionado of contemporary art, Charge d'Affaires, Thomas Smitham, personally selected. The painting is titled \\\"A Girl In a Stripe Dress\\\" by Sarah Knights. It is a 36\\\" x 48\\\" acrylic on canvas which incorporates other materials newsprint, a button and thread. An exhibit of some of the best contemporary artists on the island is being featured at the residence of the Chief of Mission with the theme \\\"Connecting Cultures: Connecting Art from Trinidad and Tobago\\\". It is aimed at unveiling the diversity of Trinidad and Tobago's contemporary art culture and linking cultures. It is an exhibition in conjunction with Medulla Gallery. Instead of sourcing the more popular aesthetics of Trinidad and Tobago's seascapes and landscapes, Smitham favoured contemporary artists whose works range in diverse themes. The selection of works by Wendy Nanan, Edward Bowen, Dean Arlen, Christopher Cozier, Irenee Shaw, Sarah Knights, Abigail Hadeed and Merylle Mahabir are all favoured by Smitham. Smitham told the Trinidad Express that while the works were distinctly Trinbagonian, they could also relate to anywhere else in the world. \\\"Art is a rich and universal language,\\\" Smitham said, \\\"one that, while grounded in some very specific cultural meanings also expresses the values, concerns and aspirations of our common humanity. \\\"I am finding that a lot of people don't know what is available here and how good your artists are. We are honoured to be able to get some of these fantastic works of artists in T&T and I hope it's not just for us but other people will also understand the existing diversity available here. We were much more interested about what the contemporary artists were producing. Traditional landscapes and seascapes are nice but the contemporary art reflects my personal interest. \\\"We felt it might be nice to feature the works of artists from Trinidad and Tobago in the residence. Through partnership with Medulla Gallery we were able to find some of the best artworks by some of the best contemporary artists from Trinidad and Tobago. What we have selected are representative of the diversity of Trinidad and Tobago and we wanted to display that. I am happy with what I have on the walls. The art works are all conversation starters for anyone who comes to the house because of the diverse range of themes from Trinidad and Tobago society and culture. \\\"When I came here the walls were empty and it took me a couple months to try to figure out what to do. We partnered with Medulla Art and instead of spending months of trying to find good art in the United States we decided to find what is available here instead. Having the art at the residence is a way for people to get familiar with the artists in Trinidad and Tobago. I found the extraordinary breadth of artistic expression, from music to art. For such a small island we have so many great artists so I thought it would be good to do an exhibit of these works here,\\\" Smitham said. Smitham will host a reception in honour of an exhibition of contemporary art from Trinidad and Tobago \\\"Connecting Cultures: Connecting Art from Trinidad and Tobago\\\" on April 3, 2013 at the residence of the US Chief of Mission, Flagstaff Hill, St James. There will be entertainment from US jazz musicians Master Gunnery Sergeant Robert Boguslaw, Gunnery Sergeamt Eric Sabo and Jeffrey Wills, who will perform a set of contemporary jazz for this occasion. Boguslaw and Sabo are members of President Obama's own US Marine Band.

Martin Daly THE djouba is a joyful dance of West Africa, said to have been brought by slaves and diffused throughout the Caribbean and the Americas. It also refers to certain musical rhythms executed on the tambour-djouba drum. It is strongly present in the culture of Martinique. Caribbean dance, much, but not all of it, derived from the continents of Africa and India from which the ancestors of the majority of our population were forcibly or dishonestly taken, has always fascinated me. It is right up there with pan in my cultural interests. It is useful to relate some recent experiences in the dance milieu to emphasise the case for putting arts and entertainment as the centrepiece of tourism policy. I do so because the significant potential for diversifying our economy through cultural tourism has again been starkly overlooked. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

Soca sensation: Nailah Blackman is scheduled to appear at Hilton\\u2019s all-inclusive event, Lavish. Despite negative international reports, Trinidad and Tobago is still a great tourism destination, says Hilton Trinidad and Conference Centre general manager Olivier Maumaire. \\u201cI must say what I heard about Trinidad before coming here was not that nice, which is unfortunate. I didn\\u2019t really know what to expect before coming here, but I must say since I\\u2019m here, it\\u2019s really a great island,\\u201d Maumaire told the Express on Friday, at the launch of Hilton\\u2019s Carnival all-inclusive, Lavish. The well-travelled France-born hotelier said he counts these twin islands among the most culturally aware destinations he has ever visited. The former Hilton Jamaica and Aruba GM says his mission is to showcase that culture to international guests. \\u201cIt is probably the most culture (aware) islands I\\u2019ve ever been. In terms of food, the entertainment, the people, it\\u2019s really very rich. There are many things to discover and I\\u2019m very impressed by that. I think we have a duty to promote the island to the people outside and our guests travelling from all places of the world because often, they come for work and their only experience of Trinidad is the hotel. So we don\\u2019t want to be like a bland hotel with nothing to offer. That\\u2019s why for me, our mission is to show Trinidad to our clients and guests,\\u201d he said. Local entertainment, food back on the menu In keeping with that objective, Maumaire\\u2019s first order of business is to bring the excitement of Carnival back to the hotel. Under his leadership, Hilton has decided to restart their annual all-inclusive fete after a decade of inactivity, with the now rebranded Lavish. The hotel\\u2019s boss promises the event will live up to all the connotations of its name and provide the perfect springboard for the global centennial celebration of the Hilton chain. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been to many carnivals in the world, right, but I think this one is really, really particular because you feel the essence of a culture. People participate, it\\u2019s not just a show (you sit and watch). I was very impressed (last year) going to fetes and (seeing) how people behave and enjoy without getting into fights or whatever. \\u201cFor me, it\\u2019s a little like Christmas season in other countries where, all of a sudden, people become nice. Carnival here is like that. People are on another mood, everyone is happy and nobody sleeps, but that\\u2019s another story,\\u201d he said. The return to the fete circuit is just one of the changes Maumaire has brought to the Hilton. He has also spearheaded a rejuvenation of both the entertainment and food menus at the 57-year-old hotel. The hotel has remodelled its swimming pool and restaurant, and will now feature weekly art and music showcases, he said. \\u201cTrinidad culture has to do with food, with art and with live entertainment. That\\u2019s why we started Art at the Hilton because we have a big legacy of art here, having the second lar\\u00adgest collection of local art on the island. We will have much more live music from local artistes as well. And all our menus are being revamped by the chef to include some of the flavours of the island,\\u201d he concluded.

He noted that calypso music can be used to boost tourism if the approach to it is revised. \\\"People can distinguish what entertainment is versus what the arts are. The art forms are produced by the creative artists. It's a different thinking that can take the art and create in such a way that it becomes entertainment.

Making her mark in the music industry, Diva presents The Cultural Exchange Tour(TCET). TCET promotes mutual understanding of cultural backgrounds through music, youth development and knowledge of international social living. Keldamuzik was inspired to start TCET when receiving invitations to perform and experience islands such as Barbados and St. Maarten, where she gained knowledge of the Caribbean lifestyle. During both tours, she collaborated with Reggae singer Kirk Brown, and artiste Ku-J, while also conducting a series of workshops at schools and non-profit organisations to inspire the youth. She also interviewed local business owners, brands and the towns people for her reality TV series, Diva TV which broadcast in five million homes in California, USA. After such visits around the islands, radio stations and other media outlets, Keldamuziks movement concluded with live concert performances featuring Keldamuzik and other local artistes in the areas. Many sponsors came aboard to support and accommodate the concerts as well as advancing other businesses and raising funds for local charities and youth foundations. Both tours lasted five-seven days separately, and were broadcast on Diva TV back in California. In the mist of it all, Diva combined all of her areas of creation and talents into one. Speaking to the youth and inspiring them to become confident individuals is what she calls The Diva Project. She loves to empower the youth and relate her previous living situation with theirs and being able to have a mutual understanding by Q&As from those who need someone influential to talk with. Conducting interviews of the natives and taping her journey through various activities in the country is what her reality show Diva TV contributes. In California she broadcasts her life as a female rapper in the Hip Hop industry and other Keldamuzik related events. As she receives many viewers around California and the internet, Keldamuzik has already beaten the odds as an independent artiste who showcases the art form of networking through television. By hosting a live concert, Keldamuzik performs various songs of her own, and with the native artists she collaborates with. She grabs the attention of the community and they realize how much more enriched their lives are through TCET. The people already uplift each other, but uplifting the community and granting them exposure is the primary function of The Cultural Exchange Tour. There are more upcoming events featuring Diva in Grenada, Jamaica, Liberia, London, Puerto Rico, Germany, Trinidad and more!

This year we are focusing on the unity part of community where we are trying to ensure that all communities exist together and work together, culturally and otherwise. And as yesterday Indian Arrival Day was celebrated, the inclusion of religious bodies in the festival is of paramount importance, Culture Secretary Dr Denise Tsoiafatt-Angus said. The journey to heritage 2014 has unearthed relationships with various religious bodies, as we collaborate with them in their expression of their unique heritage, that has contributed to our Tobagoness, she added. She also said it was imperative to strengthen the heritage festival, to serve as an educative component, authentic learning, yet providing an entertaining environment for students. I charge you all with spreading the word that the heritage festival is not a performance but an interactive classroom for learning about ourselves, our shared history and the arts. In 2013, we reacquainted ourselves with our community treasures by digging deep into our past, exploring our heritage and unearthing the rites and rituals that make our cultural expressions and ultimately, our heritage unique, she said. 2014 will see a two-week festival that now includes the inaugural launch of a three-day workshop called CACI Conference on the Arts and Creative Industry. Tsoiafatt-Angus said this forum was critical for engaging multiple sectors in discussions on the effective ways to preserve and promote Tobagos rich culture. Such that we ensure our social development and resilience, what we know as the Tobago spirit will be intact throughout future generations.

The PVAF is defined by its directors as a hub for creative expression. It is their aim that the foundation will be the medium to bridge the gap between time and space; for such is the technological age that we live in. They serve as a promotional and events-based organisation dedicated to creating a platform/forums for all artistes; highlighting local artisans in poetry, spoken word, visual art, photography, music and the arts in general. The PVAF is also engaged in networking and partnering with artistes and artists locally and also worldwide to build strong alliances and to foster growth in the cultural and artistic arena. They also seek to act as agents for amateur and skilled artisans by facilitating the process for global opportunities through representation and promotion. It is also their aim to raise the level of public awareness and entertainment by supporting positive and creative expression. The PVAF was founded by Rachael Collymore a photographer/writer/poet with a passion for all aspects of culture, entertainment and the arts and their respective development. She wanted to positively contribute to the local creative sector and entertainment industry by producing arts-based events and showcasing young and upcoming artistes along with the more accompished entertainers. I started Poetic Vibes some years ago because I had a passion for writing and poetry and wanted to create a space for others with similar interests to share and express themselves I created a Facebook group in 2007 and Poetic Vibes was born. I met and connected with many talented people across the globe using this medium and it sparked a desire in me to do something more. I believe that the greatest resource any society can have is its culture and creativity, Collymore stated. The Synergia series was launched in 2010 and has been steadily building in quality and popularity since. The series has served as the platform from which several young artistes have begun their own careers in earnest. Part of the proceeds from the PVAT events go to the continued development of the artistes themselves. Among the artistes being featured at todays show is Cyrilia Lopez, a young singer and composer from Penal who cut her teeth doing gospel before deciding to expand her repertoire to other expressions. Her songs, however, maintain positivity and offer life-building ideals. This very talented young woman who has worked at a gas station along with other jobs is now focused on making it on the international arena and based on her vocals, songwriting prowess and performance style is not too far away from realising her dreams. Also on the lineup is the winner of the 2014 Bocas Lit Fest Verses Bocas Slam competition, Idrees Saleem who is a gifted poet and blossoming actor from Arouca. The event also features performances by Afiya Ayanna Athill, Jessie Mc Barrow and visual, Annelie Solis.

He also said TUCO was affected since the organisation had events for Calypso History Month in October. Calypso History Month is billed as a celebration that focuses on the impact of calypso on peoples lives while celebrating the contribution of pioneers like the late Aldwyn Roberts (Lord Kitchener) and developing an appreciation for the indigenous art form. Brother Resistance, said: TUCO had a number of shows scheduled for NAPA and it would be affected by any closure of the facility. It also underlines the crisis that we have found ourselves in arts and entertainment which is a paucity of venues. We suffer greatly from the lack of venues. After 52 years of Independence, this dearth of venues should be addressed as a national priority. Making reference to Calypso History Month, Masimba added: TUCO had a number of shows and bookings inside for NAPA. Calypso History Month was scheduled to come off in October. As expected, we would have had a number of shows which would be a precursor to Carnival 2015. We would have to utilise the venue for a number of productions. Asked how he felt the situation should be addressed, Masimba said: I think the Government needs to view NAPAs closure as a matter of urgent national priority. There are a lot of technical problems. There are some challenges. I will not venture how the Government should go about it. They need to address it with urgency. Asked what he felt Finance Minister Larry Howai should allocate in the Budget for culture, Masimba said: There is the need for a better location for the Carnival organisations. It is mandatory for the special interest groups to deliver a better product. People expect us to deliver a great Carnival product. We are also looking forward to obtaining a broadcast licence for TUCO. Chairman of the TUCO South Zone Ras Kommanda (Steve Pascall) said: It is sad for the art form (calypso) and for the entire cultural fraternity. It is an indictment on the original contractors. Maybe, they should not have used the Chinese. Maybe, the local contractors should have been the ones to build it. Ras Kommanda added: Dont blame the government because they expected the best from the people who were awarded the contract. I know it is a blow to Calypso History Month. Out of evil cometh good, because they will have to move South for entertainment. In all seriousness, it does not augur well.

Calypso icon The Mighty Sparrow (Slinger Francisco) received a payment of $2 million from the Ministry of Community Development, Culture and the Arts yesterday in exchange for a ten-year licence of the collection of his memorabilia. Sparrow, 80, wore a broad smile as he received his cheque at a signing-over ceremony at Queen's Hall in St Ann's. The legal procedure to acquire the mementos started in 2014. Sparrow didn't make a speech but instead chose to sing a line of song that expressed his feelings after receiving the cheque. \\u201cIt's been a long time coming, it's been a long time coming but I know it was going to come.\\u201d Sparrow, who also sang a few verses of a couple of old favourites, later told reporters he plans to use part of the money to refurbish his Petit Valley home, Sparrow's Hideaway. \\u201cThe Hideaway has been there for a while...there are some repairs that need to be done so I must do that,\\u201d he said. Sparrow said it feels good to have his personal collection on exhibit. \\u201cI feel good...long time I used to drive about showing it, now people would have an opportunity to see them,\\u201d he said. Long overdue Culture Minister Nyan Gadsby-Dolly said the payment had been long overdue. \\u201cSparrow had been waiting a while for this to come to fruition and we wanted to be sure, given the urgency of time, that he would be able to be here to enjoy the payment. It had been an ongoing process with the previous administration and it had been overdue,\\u201d said the minister. Gadsby-Dolly said the cheque presentation is a demonstration of the Government's belief that showcasing presentation and development of art and culture are essential to human development. \\u201cThe work of our cultural icons, such as the Mighty Sparrow, has mirrored the everyday lives of Caribbean people. \\u201cTheir compositions and presentations are not just opportunities for entertainment, but have also been a record of the experiences of our people and our history and, most importantly, has influenced our decision and our perceptions of ourselves. \\u201cThe classic piece 'Education' comes to mind, which was an impassioned plea to persons at all levels of society to focus on the education of our children for the benefit of future generations and that type of contribution is so relevant, even today. \\u201cThis collection of treasures, artefacts and memorabilia from the Mighty Sparrow gives the public a rare insight into the icon who has been our orator and our champion and has been bold enough to tell the wide range of our stories. \\u201cIn a time when entertainers are becoming mere brands who are crafted in conference rooms, the Mighty Sparrow remains an authentic calypsonian,\\u201d said Gadsby-Dolly. Candice Alcantara, head of corporate communications at the Ministry of Community Development, Culture and the Arts, described Sparrow's work as a timeless record of the responses to the socio-economic changes and challenges faced by the people of Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean. 'Jean and Dinah' The National Theatre Arts Company of Trinidad and Tobago gave an entertaining and creative presentations of Sparrow's calypsoes, including \\u201cMelda\\u201d, \\u201cMae Mae\\u201d, \\u201cDoh Back Back\\u201d, \\u201cDrunk and Disorderly\\u201d and \\u201cJean and Dinah'.

Boothman was the sister of two famous artists Boscoe and Geoffrey Holder. Her sons Micheal, David and Roger are well-known in the world of music and art. In our photo she is accompanied by her famous sister-in-law Carmen de Lavellade wife of Geoffrey Holder. The photo was taken at the Icons of T&T Award Ceremony in May 2013 at which de Lavellade collected an award on behalf of Geoffrey. Our Mother Marjorie Holder Boothman has passed. She was one of the most incredible, intelligent, being charitable I know. She was the mother of an over, over, over-extended family of family, friends, artists, musicians, writers and community from her own contemporary through my siblings and their children. This community ranged throughout four generations. Although I am second in the line of my siblings, I am lost in the position of this over, over, over extended family. She was a leader and fighter for various causes related to arts and culture and heritage. She was a social worker that fought with the group Friends of the Hospital for changes and funding for PoS General Hospital. She was a historian, storyteller a cultural guardian a true griot . Ma Boots had an acute and extraordinary memory, she had a special gift. She could remind an elephant. Those who knew her would attest to that. Historians from all over the world would come to interview her on Caribbean culture and families. She gave freely to anyone in proximity. With that, there was a fiery passion, articulation, sincerity that would lambaste, inform, inspire and entertain all in love in her Libran way weighing the scales of justice. She celebrated her birthday on October 4th. She never went to collegenever had to. She was college. She kept all my college books and up to this day in her library and from time to time would keep me updated. She opened our home to everyone, to local and foreign artists. My mother and father started a foundation called Seeds of Talent. A concept celebrating families in the arts. They created events propelling this wonderful concept up to a time when life became harder, funding and interest questionable when corporate and government invested in more cultural trivia Ya cyan cast pearl before swinenow today even swine saying that What a dilemma. She was concerned about media programming as she cared about the conditioning of the youths minds. Ceos and ministers square pegging round holes. She had touched all three months before Lord Shorty s passing, I met with him and his wife in St James, he told me yuh know Booty, your mother and yuh family inspired me on my journey with my family. It was a great feeling to hear that and this traction was and still is evident in stories coming out of the woodwork from long time friends and artists. Another wisdom saying was Making art is about making art making money is about making moneytwo separate operationskeep them separate. My mother had inspired me twenty years ago to start the work of the Caribbean Cultural Icons Collection before it was ever conceived in the cultural ministries or media as an idea or interest. In it, I had included Umilta McShine, Roaring Lion, Pat Castangne, and a range of our multi-cultural icons who have contributed so much to the Caribbean culture. Now she is included in the collection. She also reminded that our culture is more than the Eurocentric, Afrocentric, Indo-centric, Asian-centric, it is also more Caribbean-centric. The racially political divide is a wearing adversarial device that is counter productive to our innate potential and growth in the Caribbean. Today one can see why there is no leadership with content. There is no room for Arawak, no room for the divine, no room for quality everyone only assessing by quantity. She was a fighter to the end even when the angel of death came ...had to convince her that her work is completed and the culture is too hardened and needed a different energy to continue the workShe did let go with the assurance that her work was not in vain. She is the last of a generation of cultural matriarchs She was backbone of a wonderful over, over, over, over extended family. To all within proximity of understanding: I know at this time the passing of our mom, The T&Ts Cultural Matriarch brings us to the cross-road of lifes meaning again. In this great initiation, we know at this time there is a power we have to grasp that is for us. In every passing of a family member leaves that luminous power that makes us stronger and attuned to the spirit world. It is for us to carry on the work and the blessing as we share in this temporary side of life. Lets seek this power and smile knowing the everlasting connection of the other world of Gods light and love. We all are from the greatest families on the planet.

Sharma said the NCIC, which is housed at the site, intends to expand the facility and include a library and research centre. He said a peace and spiritual park would also be constructed to enhance the site. He said the NCIC had made significant contributions to the development of Indian culture in Trinidad and Tobago. I declare today this site, which has not yet been named, which has been known as Divali Nagar site, will henceforth be officially called NCIC Nagar, said Sharma. And he denied rumours that the Divali Nagar was being funded by the State. Sharma maintained that the NCIC continues to raise funds through fund-raisers, donations and rental of the site by the Indian Trade Fair. Sharma was speaking at the NCIC 50th anniversary ceremony at the Divali Nagar site on Saturday night. Seven founding members and persons who have contributed to the development of the organisation were honoured at the function.

He praised NCIC for its work over the years and for supporting Indian culture. He said the NCIC was a positive impact on Trinidad and Tobago. Bharath pledged his support to the organisation through his Ministry and said he would support a televised documentary on the lives of the seven icons. The organisation was established by founding members Bisram Gopie and Narsaloo Ramaya at a time when East Indian art forms depended on oral traditions. It was formed to promote the preservation of Indian culture and to expose the younger generations to their cultural roots, he said. NCIC continues to make contributions through cultural programmes, publication of books, magazines and newsletters and art exhibitions. NCIC hosted book fairs and international cricket matches between the West Indies and India for its 150th Indian Arrival Day Anniversary.

Eighteen-year-old Kleah Mannette created history on Friday evening by being the youngest honouree of the St James Community Improvement Committee (CIC). The committee broke with their tradition of honouring retired persons who have served the community. The audience at the launch of the 14th edition of WeBeat at the St James Amphitheatre was made up of most of the past honourees who were very pleased with the CICs choice this year. Mannette won the Dr Leroy Clarke Trophy for the Most Outstanding in the Women in Art Competition and followed that by winning the Republic Bank Trophy for Graphics for Cooperative Use. In the CXC examinations, Mannette placed ninth in the Caribbean in Art and earned distinctions in three categories. An avid pannist, she is currently on PCS Silver Stars stage side and is also studying for her Level Five Certificate in music. She says art is music and the same way a story can be told through a song, it parallels what could be done with a painting. The other honouree on Friday evening was actor/playwright/teacher/cultural ambassador Freddie Kissoon. The 83-year-old founder of the Strolling Players has a long history in the arts and entertainment industry, having written over 70 plays and acted on stage over 200 times.

He noted there were more activities at this years festivities. A large crowd turned out at the Savannah to experience a number of cultural events.

A GIFT FOR CAROLYN: San Fernando West MP Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan is greeted on arrival at the Naparima Bowl, San Fernando, by Sandra Sawak-Allum. Stunning, historic and emotional, aptly described the 50th anniversary concert presented by southern cultural activists who over the past 50 years had performed in song, music, dance and drama at Naparima Bowl, San Fernando. The commemorative concert titled \\\"An era in an evening\\\" took place at the Bowl's auditorium on Saturday, with over 600 patrons attending the show. The production, which was conceptualised and directed by cultural activist James Lee Wah, told the story of Naparima Bowl during its 50 years of existence, giving samples of the artistic life of San Fernando, and also the ill- fated fire that destroyed part of the Bowl in 1977. Lee Wah remarked, \\\"We owe all of this to two great citizens of San Fernando, businessman Robert Montano and music teacher Grace Abdool who had the vision and determination to campaign for a theatre for San Fernando. The three-hour concert began with a forecourt welcome by Carnival masqueraders, African drummers, tassa drummers and a display by moko jumbies. Following this patrons were entertained by members of the Arawak Dance Group led by dance icon Torrance Mohammed to be followed by sensations in steel and Indian classical dances. In the field of drama, Ralph Maraj returned to his old performing ground accompanied by Mavis Lee Wah in Shakespeare's Dark Lady of the Sonnet, a George Bernard Shaw play. Joy Caesar was on hand to conduct the Southern Knights performance \\\"Valderi Valdera\\\", as well as the Southernaires Choir. The entire performance was to show those who were not around when the Bowl opened its doors in August 1962 that \\\"the Bowl brought life to the arts and it must remain as the cultural centre of the south\\\", Lee Wah said. Chairman of the Bowl's Management committee Sandra Sawak-Allum commented, \\\"I am proud to be able to say that after so many years the Bowl continues to grow stronger and stronger as the cultural receptacle of the south.\\\" Attending the performance was Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan, MP for San Fernando West and Minister of Public Administration.

Karma and Hemlata Dindial scored big at the tenth 103FM Hall of Fame and Music Awards Ceremony at Queen's Hall, St Ann's in a night that paid tribute to the best in local Indian culture and heritage. Musical powerhouse Karma lifted the titles for Best Produced CD by a Local Band and Album of the Year for Karmageddon, whilst Ravi B bested the rest in the groups, Best Chutney Soca Collaboration (Jep Sting Remix featuring Hunter, Ravi B and Kees), Best Music Video (Dularie Tanty produced by Peter C Lewis, Synergy TV), Courts 'Trini Hit' Most Popular Local Song (Dularie Tanty) and bmobile's People's Choice (Dularie Tanty). A visibly overwhelmed Dindial earned the coveted Song of the Year award for Kaan \\\"Payra\\\". Dindial was also named Best Female Chutney Artiste and her tune also topped the category of Best Musical Arranger (Original Song). Kenneth Salick's \\\"Radica\\\", won the awards for Best Lyricist and Best Chutney Soca Song. The night also saw eight individuals and groups being inducted into the prestigious Hall of Fame. Video presentations on each inductee preceded the segment. This year the list included Sam Boodram (classical singing), Sandra Sookdeo (dance), Emanuel Doon, (folk art expressions), Doon Ramsundar (instrumentalist), the Naya Tarana Orchestra (orchestration), the Boodoosingh Tassa Group (tassa) and the Cedar Hill Youth Social and Cultural Organisation (folk expressionsRamleela). Special Family Recognition was given to the Jeewan Singh Family for their promotion of Indian culture. Special Recognition Awards were bestowed upon Justice Ralph Narine, Southex chief executive officer, George Singh and chief executive officer, Balroop's Sound Systems Limited, Vishnu Balroop.

Entertainers were backed by the Nirvana Dancers. Music was provided by JMC 3Veni. The event was broadcast live on television and was attended by President George Maxwell Richards, Dr Jean Ramjohn-Richards and Arts and Multiculturalism Minister, Winston Peters. In opening the night's activities, 103FM Chairman Reyaz Ahamad said the event had come a long way from its humble beginnings in 2000 when it was first held at Centre Point Mall in Chaguanas. Then there were six inductees. He said that since then, 100 names have been inducted into the 103 Hall of Fame. The aim, he said, has always been the same: to recognise the efforts of those who develop, perpetuate and preserve East Indian culture. He said the show has given hope to cultural figures for their hard work over the years that has not been recognised or appreciated. He added that to the artistes, it represents the reward for their toil. \\\"Many look at these awards as a mark of appreciation of their art. They also strive more diligently because of it since such recognition provides a benchmark for further endeavours.

Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the capital projects itself as a young, dynamic and cosmopolitan city at the heart of Europe. Originally a symbol of separation, since Reunification the former \\\"Walled City\\\" of Berlin has developed into a popular travel destination and is highly indicative of the current trend. Guests are not only interested in the history and culture of the city, but also in the way it has changed. But exactly what is it that actually makes Berlin so attractive It is the diversity, the contrasts and the sheer inexhaustible potential of this capital city to consistently fire the enthusiasm of its visitors from all over the world. The exciting mixture of history and Zeitgeist, the broad spectrum of art, culture, music, entertainment and shopping facilities, the modern hotel landscape, the diversity of its cuisine and its outstanding cost-effectiveness by comparison to other destinations in Europe all go to make up the special charm that is the metropolis on the Spree. A flourishing creative scene together with Berlin's hip music and club culture likewise contribute to the unmistakable lifestyle metropolis with a population of around 3.4 million. At the heart of Berlin's arts landscape is the Museum Island, encompassing five buildings in the historic city centre. When the Neues Museum was reopened in October 2009 it was the first time for 70 years that all the museums in the ensemble, unique in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999, had been accessible to the public. As a UNESCO \\\"City of Design\\\" and the first German city to figure in the worldwide network of \\\"Creative Cities\\\", Berlin is well to the fore in the architecture, art and fashion sectors. It is here in the hip 'scene' metropolis that tomorrow's trends are born. Since Reunification the Berlin artistic scene has developed into one of the most exciting and dynamic in Europe and is currently experiencing an enormous influx of creative talent from all over the world. The number of galleries in which young, talented artists present contemporary and alternative art for the collections of tomorrow is increasing rapidly. Neither are the shopping facilities in Berlin any less varied than the fashions. It's all there - from chic to trendy, from elegant haute couture right through to casual urban and street wear. In the evenings a multitude of experiences awaits in the shape of the ever changing Berlin music and club scene where closing time is unheard of. With its pulsating nightlife and unusual locations, the party metropolis weaves a spell that captivates everyone. Berliners and international tourists can experience the sound of the capital in the hip bars and discotheques of the city, where you can dance and party right through to the small hours.

The group has for the past 42 years produced an annual festival of culture shortly after Carnival. \\u2013Photo: Stephen Doobay For 42 years a group of culture-lovers from St James have been sharing their passion for the drum with the people of the nation through their annual three-day event. The Village Drums of Freedom (VDF) will from today host their post Carnival production, Rhythms and Drums Around the World at the Ellie Mannette Park at the corner of DeFreitas and Alfred Richard Streets, St James. VDF founding member, Nyron Greenidge told the Express that today will feature a video night where clips of past productions will be shown. There will also be videos exploring African cultures, Afro-Trinbagonian culture and documentaries about various facets of the African continent. This event is free to the public as are the others over the weekend. Tomorrow the VDF hosts a Reggae Night show and dance from 10 p.m. that will include live performances by several local reggae singers, including, King David. Several top conscious sound systems such as Lion King, Black Chariot, Solid Rock and DJ Nardel will be among the systems providing music throughout the night. Sunday is the annual Childrens Treat where the little ones from the community and environs will be served snacks and be entertained through games and various activities from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. The Culture Fest will follow with performances by several calypsonians including, Valentino, Black Stalin, Blaxx, Gary Cordner, SuperBlue, Lavway and Crazy. Among the steel orchestras appearing are: Phase II Pan Groove, Scrunters Pan Groove, Tripolians and North Stars. The drum ensembles performing are: Block 4, Culture Shop, Northwest, St James Cultural Drummers and the Wassi Dance Company. There will also be a presentation on the International Year for People of African Descent, which is being observed this year. Other performances include moko jumbies and other traditional mas characters. Greenidge said over the years the VDF has received assistance from the Government from time to time in producing the event, but he said it is not sure if the Peoples Partnership will offer assistance. They continue to do the events of the festival out of pocket and with the assistance of businesses in the St James community as well as people that contribute what they can. Fellow VDF founding member, Jerry Achee added that the festival is a labour of love and a way to encourage the youth to pursue culture rather than crime. The VDF was formed by a group of pupils from the Mucurapo Boys RC Primary. The school was participating in the Schools Arts Festival of 1969 and had invited pupils to join the dance troupe. Some of the dancers lived in what was known as the Housing Scheme in St James and they were always liming and playing football and cricket. After the arts festival the group continued to perform under the name of Scheme Rangers. With no adult leader the seven youths saw after their own affairs and eventually attracted the attention of several elders in the area and as far away as Carenage that began to assist them by giving them advice. The group became well known and was invited to perform at various concerts and functions such as opening ceremonies of the St James Youth Centre as well as the Carenage and Maraval Community Centres.

At right is third-placed Keston Bledman, also from T&T. Photo: AP Shortly after independence Prime Minister Dr Eric Williams embarked on a Meet the People Tour throughout the villages in Trinidad. At the end of the tour he described the exercise as an unforgettable experience that brought me in contact with the ordinary people. As the nations first Prime Minister he said, all that was needed was to give the energy and enthusiasm I found in the villages the opportunities for self expression and a home in which to nurture the arts, craft and other cultural expressions of our people. Arising out of the tour he announced a programme called The Prime Ministers Best Village Trophy Competition (PMBVTC). The aim of the programme was to accelerate building of community centres throughout the country, and using these centres to promote the latent talent in the villages. Although he had travelled extensively during election campaigns, he admitted that he had not visited some areas in Trinidad and Tobago, especially in the rural areas.Williams said, One of the valuable results of the tours was that I was able to know the country better than I did before. The report on his visit quoted him as saying, It was not my first visit to L Anse Fourmi or to Paratuvier. I already knew quite well La Fillette or Brasso Seco, which has always been one of my favourite spots of natural beauty of the countryside. But the tour allowed me to pay my first visit to Aripo a village way behind Gods back. All that I could say to the people of Trinidad is that living behind Gods back is beautiful. During the tour, Williams met with village council members, womens groups, youth groups, sporting and cultural clubs, and agricultural credit societies. Everywhere he went there were schoolchildren on hand to perform and entertain him. Inspired by this Williams went on, after the construction of community centres and other projects, to establish in earnest the Better Village programme under the direction of Joyce Wong Sang, his sister-in-law, and cultural activist Norvan Fullerton. Wong Sang in a recent interview said, when the programme started we had no prior knowledge of what form it should take. We started from scratch, we made some mistakes, but by and large it achieved the purpose set out by the Prime Minister. She explained that the vision of the PMBVTC was to champion the integrated village concept in and among communities throughout Trinidad and Tobago. It was also to partner with other communities to identify and satisfy their needs through the provision of gender sensitive, quality programmes and services. Wong Sang said, the objective of the programme was to empower communities, by providing them with opportunities that will enhance the surroundings in which they live. It was also designed to promote national pride, and to encourage folk art and the upliftment of art in general, as well as identifying historical and environmental sites throughout Trinidad and Tobago. After serving as Director of the Programme for 25 years she retired. In 1992 she was awarded the Chaconia Medal Gold. for her services in the area of cultural development. The competition started in January each year. Its aim was to build preserve and protect folk traditions and facilitate the growth of natural culture in categories of traditional Carnival, handicraft, food and folk fair, environmental sanitation and selection of a queen at a show called La Reine Rive. Prizes were awarded in each category with the overall winner receiving a $200,000 prize. La Reine Rive, a popular cultural presentation, is now the longest running queen competition in Trinidad and Tobago. It is open to females between the ages 16-25 years. Many contestants from the La Reine Rive queen competition went on to enter other queen competitions.

She won a dizzying number of awards, including several from the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO). Interviewed yesterday, Madeira said: \\u201cI am quite saddened. I am taken by surprise. She was a Newsday columnist and freelance journalist providing articles. Her passion for arts, culture, cuisine and entertainment drove her beyond the limits. \\u201cAlthough she was well advanced, Hilton was eternally committed to her craft. She had a long, quality life. Her commitment to the noble profession of journalism is what one desires and the discipline with which she approached her task.

The first band mounted the stage around 3.30 p.m. under the blistering sun, only to return 20 minutes later to entertain Arts and Multiculturalism Minister Lincoln Douglas and a contingent of visiting Nigerian nationals. The Nigerian guests, said Minister Douglas, were in Trinidad to experience the festival and support it by exporting Trinidad and Tobago culture in Nigeria. However, when they arrived there was very little for them to see and the first band, Chaguanas RC School, portraying Fancy Sailors, was asked to return to the stage with their fancy foot and powder presentation. Douglas said they were visiting several other regional Carnival parades in Paramin and Arima. One hour later, the second band, Leslie-Ann Morgan and Associates, tried to recapture the guests' attention with their presentation, \\\"We Culture, We People\\\", but even then they seemed hardly amused. After the band had completed its presentation, Minister Douglas and his entourage joined them for a photograph off stage and they left the site. Patrons and masqueraders did not come out in their usual numbers as in previous years, leaving other guests without entertainment.

That, however, is only now being set in place by the Peoples Partnership Government after years of pleading for such by people involved in the cultural as well as the arts and entertainment sectors. The Department of Creative & Festival Arts of the University of the West Indies on February 11 held the inaugural symposium of its Thnk Tank series at the Centre for Language Learning Auditorium UWI, St Augustine. The day's theme was; Carnival, Multiculturalism and State Policy and among the panelists were Peter Minshall, Dr Pat Bishop, Dr Suzanne Burke, Marcia Riley and Peter Scoon. One of the sessions in the daylong symposium was titled Carnival and Multiculturalism Development. Here the panel explored whether or not Carnival could be used as a catalyst for developing a National Cultural Policy that is underpinned by the concepts of diversity and social inclusion. Dr Bishop took the lead here, opening her presentation stating, \\\"I have nothing interesting to say,\\\" causing light laughter to erupt from the audience that consisted of players in the cultural and Carnival arenas. Bishop went on to say that everyone knows that when it comes to Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago the, \\\"French claim it. The Africans counterclaim it and the contemporary Carnival is not as creative as it was. The music is louder, faster and it is more intensely marketed.\\\" Bishop went on to say that today, in the midst of the continued commercialisation of Carnival we see panmen who are begging for more money to play in Panorama being shot and killed in \\\"the blood rituals of the gang bang masquerade\\\". Bishop said it seems that today the pan is, at best, in danger. Meanwhile, Bishop went on, men who used to make mas are now hustling a, \\\"CECEP wuk,\\\" what with so many bands opting to import parts of and in some cases even entire costumes from China and India. Bishop said typically a policy is a principle or a role, which guides decisions with the intention of achieveing rational outcomes. She said policy, however, does not describe what is actually done, but simply provides a sort of mapped out method on how one can proceed. \\\"Policy deals with the whats and the whys and the hows we do it, but not with the doing itself. Now this is very inelegant language, but I really want to make myself clear. A policy may be described as being a statement of intent and it may arise out of or be applied to individuals, organisations or institutions. \\\"For example if under a policy about music now for Carnival and we wanted to understand that Carnival is to make money. We have to have plenty people. We have to have a big truck with a lot of loud sound systems on it, a little pan rack would not work. The policy would give rise to the big truck and against the small pan rack. On the other hand as we pursue the big truck we have to remember that the EMA (Environmental Management Agancy) has policies as well regarding the levels of noise. So Carnival music like everything else involves a contest for space,\\\" Bishop said.

This is ironic because the current Government's attitude to the performing arts is as patronising and as policy-less as that of its predecessors. I sat on the pavement's edge on Tragarete Road on Independence morning 2012, soaking in ordinary Trinbago at its best, meeting and making good company within a living embodiment of 3Canal's Morning Neighbour, in the warm embrace of Invaders' breakfast sale and later at the first of the Playboyz' entertainment spectaculars. I reflected again on the congenital inability of our \\\"part time lovers\\\" of popular culturesincerely to appreciate the richness of what we have, whatever cunning words fall from their spin-laden lips. It has taken me a week to digest the brilliance of the experience. The second of Playboyz productions was a street show with five stages stretching from Cipriani Boulevard to French Street, proving that a small yard could produce a big show. The leadership of Brian Kuei Tung was formidable. His project took a cultural presentation to the proverbial different level. The next day, I read the republication of what Derek Walcott wrote in the Independence supplement of the Sunday Guardian of August 26, 1962, entitled \\\"The Prospects Of A National Theatre\\\". Although describing himself \\\"as a St Lucian writer\\\", Walcott is positive in his assessment of the cultural richness of Trinidad. \\\"This is a nation which celebrates with more artistic expression on a popular level than probably anywhere else in the world\\\". Although Walcott made this assessment 50 years ago, I submit that his summation has remained unwaveringly true of us to this day. It can hardly be contradicted that we lived every word of it during August 2012. Even the military parade on Independence morning is a popular artistic expression. Once the services involved in the parade leave the jacketed and culturally tied confines of the official parade ground, their demeanour changes and there is a lilt in the step of the march past; and so it should be since the march music is calypso/soca. There are sometimes sneering references to indigenous popular culture. These may be provoked by the more extreme manifestations of \\\"ben' over and wine \\\", what the Bajan's call \\\"wukking up\\\". Discerning commentators however understand the role of popular culture in our society. In his assessment of 50 years ago Walcott also wrote this of Trinidad and Tobago: \\\"It is a nation of any number of popular poets, the only nation which has a spontaneous national festival of language and music, the only nation which is not faking its ballad tradition, its freedom of artistic and popular satire. The only nation with so much exuberant genius within the archipelago, and the only nation that has done nothing for the arts because the arts are too available.\\\" Other high-powered commentators have analysed the elements of play within our performing arts and have concluded that some of our play is fundamentally serious and constitutes resistance to the authoritarian streaks in the political cultures which seek to dominate us. See Culture in Action-The Trinidad experience edited by Professor MillaCozartRiggio of Trinity College, Connecticut. Fifty years later our genius has lost neither its exuberance nor its resistance. Our performing arts have survived, not all in the same shape or form, but just as vibrant and inventive. If you doubt my assertion that we are still inventive go and hear the National Steel Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Jessel Murray using the G Pan and PHI, these instruments slowly gaining the respect of the pan movement now that they are no longer instruments of political braggadocio and preference. Indoor theatre at all points between Miss Miles and the comedies of Choo Kong and Ragoobarsingh is in bloom. Nevertheless fifty years later we still lack the National Theatre of which Walcott wrote. The Trinidad Theatre Workshop was itself a victim of governmental eviction from Hart Street. I do not know the full story of its relocation to 23 Jerningham Avenue but I have visited the space. The premises are frail, funds are few, but whatever the history the creative spirit lives. Yes, the relevant ministries do help fund the performing arts but it is so ad hoc, so much of a begging job. There are also enlightened and faithful sponsors but not nearly as many as we need. Meanwhile, there on the streets, like many others, I reaffirmed my independence from the grasp of officialdom. God spare life, as they say, I plan to stay out there, sitting on the pavement edge, chipping in the yard and, indoors and out, taking in all the vibrant genius, loving it all the way, eh Black Stalin.This is where a large part of the real Trinbago resides. I am proud and privileged to describe it.

The village of St John\\u2019s at the foothills of Mount St Benedict, Tunapuna, has a rich history that is far more substantial than being the place where a Benedictine monk from Brazil, Dom Mayeul De Caigny, established a monastery in 1912. Once officially noted as the place where the smallest parish in the Roman Catholic Church worldwide was located, St John the Baptist RC Church, St John\\u2019s Village has over the years produced a number of persons who have attained great success in several spheres: sport, culture, entertainment, business, fashion, culinary arts, journalism and more. During the period spanning the late 1970\\u2019s to the mid- 1990s, a group of young people from St John\\u2019s were members of the St John the Baptist RC Church Youth Choir, as well as the parish\\u2019s Youth Group.

The group has for the past 42 years produced an annual festival of culture shortly after Carnival. \\u2013Photo: Stephen Doobay For 42 years a group of culture-lovers from St James have been sharing their passion for the drum with the people of the nation through their annual three-day event. The Village Drums of Freedom (VDF) will from today host their post Carnival production, Rhythms and Drums Around the World at the Ellie Mannette Park at the corner of DeFreitas and Alfred Richard Streets, St James. VDF founding member, Nyron Greenidge told the Express that today will feature a video night where clips of past productions will be shown. There will also be videos exploring African cultures, Afro-Trinbagonian culture and documentaries about various facets of the African continent. This event is free to the public as are the others over the weekend. Tomorrow the VDF hosts a Reggae Night show and dance from 10 p.m. that will include live performances by several local reggae singers, including, King David. Several top conscious sound systems such as Lion King, Black Chariot, Solid Rock and DJ Nardel will be among the systems providing music throughout the night. Sunday is the annual Children's Treat where the little ones from the community and environs will be served snacks and be entertained through games and various activities from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. The Culture Fest will follow with performances by several calypsonians including, Valentino, Black Stalin, Blaxx, Gary Cordner, SuperBlue, Lavway and Crazy. Among the steel orchestras appearing are: Phase II Pan Groove, Scrunters Pan Groove, Tripolians and North Stars. The drum ensembles performing are: Block 4, Culture Shop, Northwest, St James Cultural Drummers and the Wassi Dance Company. There will also be a presentation on the International Year for People of African Descent, which is being observed this year. Other performances include moko jumbies and other traditional mas characters. Greenidge said over the years the VDF has received assistance from the Government from time to time in producing the event, but he said it is not sure if the People's Partnership will offer assistance. They continue to do the events of the festival out of pocket and with the assistance of businesses in the St James community as well as people that contribute what they can. Fellow VDF founding member, Jerry Achee added that the festival is a labour of love and a way to encourage the youth to pursue culture rather than crime. The VDF was formed by a group of pupils from the Mucurapo Boys' RC Primary. The school was participating in the Schools Arts Festival of 1969 and had invited pupils to join the dance troupe. Some of the dancers lived in what was known as the Housing Scheme in St James and they were always liming and playing football and cricket. After the arts festival the group continued to perform under the name of Scheme Rangers. With no adult leader the seven youths saw after their own affairs and eventually attracted the attention of several elders in the area and as far away as Carenage that began to assist them by giving them advice. The group became well known and was invited to perform at various concerts and functions such as opening ceremonies of the St James Youth Centre as well as the Carenage and Maraval Community Centres.

The second to last day of the 2014 Soca in bSquare entitled Tun Over Thursday brought an onslaught of entertainment to Woodford Square, Port of Spain. blink | bmobile took the opportunity amidst the festivity to award the three winners of its recent art competition. The art competition which was launched by the blink | bmobile Foundation last October, targeted budding local visual artists between the ages of 16 and 21 years and challenged them to use art to interpret the theme Imagine Trinidad and Tobago in order to qualify for top prizes. The top pieces were selected from the pool of submitted entries by a panel of T&Ts artistic authorities and displayed on the blink | bmobile Facebook page. The three winners, Jahmel John, Nandaa Maharajh and Rajesh Harinarine were present at bSquare on Tun Over Thursday to collect their well-earned prizes as well as to enjoy the pulsating performances by soca entertainers Dil-e-Nadan, Kerwin DuBois, Farmer Nappy, Iwer George and The Baron. Among the prizes awarded that day were Samsung Galaxy 3 Tablets, vouchers for art supplies and most notably the opportunity of a lifetime i.e. a five-week mentorship programme with leading internationally-renowned artist Leroy Clarke. John, a student of COSTAAT, is currently majoring in Graphic Design and aspires to do graphics and tattoo art professionally. His art piece represented The future of T&Ti.e. the children of the nation as seen by a child drawing the map of T&T inside of a heart. He shared, Im very thankful to blink | bmobile for this chance to showcase my talent and for this foundation for my future career goals. Maharajh also expressed gratitude for the opportunity presented to her by the network. The 16-year-old Lakshmi Girls pupil depicted the competitions theme by including several national emblems and aspects which she admired. These included the National Anthem which according to her represents our journey as a people. She plans to have her own art exhibitions while simultaneously studying medicine in the near future. Harinarine who is presently pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering at The UWI has aspirations of being an entrepreneur in his field so that he can have time to continue with his passion of art. His piece entitled Mother Trinidaddepicted a female character built out of different local cultural facets such as the pan, Carnival costumes etc. He stated that the competition was a good way to promote local artists and that he was thankful to blink | bmobile for the opportunity. The blink | bmobile Foundation understands the importance of supporting the fine arts sector as it is no longer considered a mere pastime and that there are presently several local and regional nationals who have made profitable careers as painters, sculptors, textile and ceramic artists, etc. According to a representative from blink | bmobile, It was the Foundations pleasure to host this competition as it gave these budding artists a platform to showcase their work and to also propel the progress of their careers.

A more vikey-vie handling of the issue could not be imagined. That being said, in this matter of funding for the Chutney Soca Monarch competition, we find no reason to sympathise with either the Government or the show promoter. The Government has only itself to blame for the loud public criticism\\u2014bordering on irrationality, in some cases\\u2014over its cut in funding for the competition. Like every government before it, the Keith Rowley administration seems to have zero interest in implementing the long-promised culture policy so necessary for setting the basis for a transparent and accountable framework for State funding for culture and arts initiatives. As with all other governments, it seems unwilling to surrender the power of political patronage that it enjoys in controlling the State purse. As long as governments prioritise politics over economics and national development, they would just have to take the political fallout that comes with such control. While the predecessor People's Partnership government had enough money to throw around and keep everyone happy, this PNM Government does not and must therefore expect to be the butt of widespread complaint as it divvies up smaller pieces of a shrinking pie among the large number of interests that have come to depend on State patronage. We have no hesitation in saying major profit-making events like the Chutney Soca Monarch and Soca Monarch shows should not be funded by the State. These are entrepreneurial initiatives which, according to figures presented by their owners, attract some of the largest crowds of paying customers. In addition to ticket sales, they cash in by selling advertising space, sponsor \\u00adassociation, vending franchises and product placement, among other revenue-earning opportunities. There is no way these shows do not make big money. By underwriting the cost of the show to any degree what\\u00adsoever, the Government is just helping these business people to fatten their pockets. Entrepreneurs like George Singh and Peter Scoon and, before them, William Munroe and the Martineau brothers, have demonstrated great business acumen in turning popular indigenous culture into entertaining money spinners. As in any other business, they should have the ability to adjust their businesses during times of economic downturn. There is no law that says these shows have to keep getting bigger in order to be better especially when, in the final analysis, it is the people's love for soca and chutney and the competitive nature of the events, that drive crowd attendance. We therefore see no compelling development support rationale for the Government to bankroll these proven events of high market value. Whatever limited State funds exist should be used to support art and culture efforts that are important but not profitable or are in the nursery stage and require support to deliver on future revenue potential. This is why this newspaper has been urging successive \\u00adgovernments to establish an independently-managed Art and Culture Fund, operating at arm's length from the government and State agencies.

I was able to attend a few nights and was surprised to see G-rated and child-friendly performances that showcased Trinidad's culture and great talent. I believe the Carnival Village was one of the best aspects of the season and I hope it continues every year. However, I suggest the village be marketed more extensively and clearly. Although I enjoyed the village, no one we talked to there could say what performances would be on nightly. Initially we saw in the media that entertainment would be from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and there would be an entrance fee. When we got to the village there was no fee (much to our delight), but we were informed that the entertainment did not start until 7 p.m. Also, we heard of the Christian performances only on the day they were supposed to be held, Ash Wednesday. I believe this lack of appropriate marketing kept down the patron numbers for the entertainment portion. I suggest that next year a programme of scheduled performances be listed for every night and the programme distributed in the newspapers, online and at the village. Also, many of the booths did not have enough information and detailed history or attendants to explain their content. The best booth belonged to the soca chutney group which had great historical detail, pictures and helpful attendants. Come on, Pan Trinbago and Tourism Development Company, you can do better. On the night patrons were not around for the videos, a few more detailed displays would have been great. Overall, I really appreciate the effort made with the Carnival Villagethe staff and security were great and I hope the village continues to grow every year and becomes a Carnival staple.

PURSUING HIS DREAM: Hayden Peters aka \\u0093Therapy\\u0094. He says even if his logical mind were to tell him to give up on chasing his musical dream, his heart would never allow it. Hayden Peters, known best as Therapy a Caledonia, Morvant resident continues to follow his heart. Currently, he is doing all thats necessary to promote himself, in the same breath admitting that getting people in Trinidad and Tobago, to pay closer attention and understand what he is about, has been the biggest challenge. In the past few weeks he has been hard at work in the Juelio Nu Generation Studios where a new pre-Carnival release called, Wine on Somebody has been wrapped up and is set for release across the nation. Therapy says the track, which was written by him will be the first of several new tracks he aims at releasing. Studio time is prime time for Therapy. He has been occupying the recording studio a lot in the past few months, explaining that because of that, he has had very little time to make appearances at events. However, all of that will change, he assures, noting that the time has now come for some serious networking and promotion of his music. With a number of singles already created, the young entertainer says he wont be deterred by anything as he pushes forward. In August, the budding artiste worked with two local entertainment professionals who, ironically, carry the names, Wizz Kidd the music producer and Wyzz Kidd the video director. Together, they released a video medley featuring two of Therapys older singles, Million Dollar Wine and Good Every Time. Therapy says he is happy with the progress so far and plans on keeping a steady head, as he journeys onward. Like many budding entertainers on the local circuit, Therapy understands that one must put in the work. I will continue to put my best foot forward and deliver music thats fit for the world to enjoy, he said. Referring to the work of T&T artiste, Bunji Garlin in recent months, in his bid to highlight just how much of an impact the music of our locals can have on the wider world, Therapy said, We must have confidence in our own product before others can. It would be nice to see corporate entities and Government agencies supporting the arts more, he added, noting that many of the youths who come from depressed communities have held fast to culture and sport as a way out of their situations. Like many in the entertainment industry, Therapy hopes that the Government and corporate T&T could see the financial benefits that could be derived if more investment is made in arts and culture. He however says he wont wait for things to happen instead he chooses to chart his own course, no matter how long it may take. With the love for music on his sleeve and a passion to propel, neither stigma nor obstacle will stop this young musical soul.

The second edition of Tobago Fashion Coda, is set to take the stage on April 24, the Thursday before the first international night of Tobago Jazz. The ultimate experience in fashion, music and food, will be held under the theme, 'Tobago Love'. The question may be asked what is a Coda It is a musical term that signals the passage or movement that brings a piece to its finale or end. And according to events founder and CEO of the event Don Grant, it is the collection of words or music, that you can't quite get out of your head. Grant held a similar event last year, and this year he intends to pump up the volume, with his event once again. The Ministry of Tourism, Tobago House of Assembly and other sponsors and partners, are set to play a major role in the million dollar event. Calypso King of the World the Mighty Sparrow will be the special guest at the event and will belt out popular tunes such as 'Jean and Dinah' and 'Congo Man'. With fashion designers such as Delia Alleyne, Peter Elias, House of Jaipur, Heather Jones, Gregory Mills, Ecliff Elie, Sean Griffith-Perez, Saleem Samuel and Monica Schinkel, just to name a few, are set to bring the catwalk alive, with a fusion of calypso and fashion. Tobago Fashion Coda 2014, for its second season will take place at the Magdalena Resort pool side, and Grant is promising an unforgettable event. \\\"It will be the ultimate fashion and style showcase, a premium inclusive event, with an extensive bar of premium liquid refreshment,\\\" Don Grant says. During the official launch of the event at the Magdalena Resort on Tuesday, deputy permanent secretary in the Ministry of Tourism, Samdai Rampersad said, the Ministry is very mindful of the unique attributes of Trinidad and Tobago, and the mix of cultures and creative energies that distinguishes the island from our Caribbean neighbours. \\\"It is my understanding that our local fashion industry employs more than 11,000 persons either directly or indirectly, and generates in excess of $25 million annually. With the development of Fashion Coda, Tobago is also being positioned as an attractive blend of fashion, entertainment and fashion,\\\" Rampersad said. While Assistant Secretary in the Division of Community Development and Culture Ancil Dennis said fashion is therefore, \\\"\\u2026one of the crowning achievements of western civilisation\\\". It is either creative to the point of being an 'art', enabling individuals and cultures to express their inner feelings and personalities. \\\"Fashion is a way of life. It's an opportunity for us in Tobago to express our unique culture and heritage. And therefore, the Tobago House of Assembly, in the past would have invested significantly in events such as this one in an effort to promote and preserve our unique fashion industry.

In the absence of this policy, the public remains completely in the dark about how the government is deciding on which entities should receive grants, and how much each should get. This is a worrying state of affairs that lends itself to arbitrary decision-making and public distrust in how taxpayers money is spent to support cultural activities, including some of the biggest Carnival competitions. Prime examples are the International Soca Monarch and Chutney Soca Monarch competitions. Saturday nights Chutney Soca Monarch competition received the princely sum of $4.5 million in direct funding from the government of which $2 million went to the first prize. While organisers of the International Soca Monarch competition are still in discussions with the State about funding, experience would suggest that it is likely to receive at least matching funds, if not more. It is impossible to judge the management and viability of these extravaganzas when they are so highly subsidised by the public purse. In continuing to dole out state funds to private entertainment entrepreneurs, both profit-driven and non-profit, the government runs the serious risk of deepening the dependency on state support way beyond what is affordable with ticket sales and corporate sponsorship. While we accept the critical importance of state support for Arts and Culture, such support should not be extended on some open-ended basis without relevance to san acceptable cost/benefit framework. We know that many benefits are intangible, but even those have to be quantified and guided by clear-cut policy. The public purse can only be protected by a transparent process guided by coherent public policy. Without an intelligent and transparent policy framework, the government could become an easy prey to operators for whom state support is a substitute for innovative financing approaches. In such a situation, the State ends up blocking entrepreneurship, supporting the development of monopolies and denying the markets potential for encouraging greater innovation through competition. Although these issues have been with us for a long time, they are getting increasingly difficult to deal with due to State procrastination. The failure to deal with the challenge will lead, inevitably, to a hardening of assumptions and entrenched feelings of entitlement of support from the public purse. Minister of the Arts and Multiculturalism, Dr Lincoln Douglas has raised the issue of sustainability but he, above all, must surely recognise that his ministrys failure to develop a Culture Policy for guiding the disbursement of grants, is counter-productive to the goal. Having condemned the fund disbursement approach of PNM culture minister Joan Yuille-Williams, the Peoples Partnership Government has been committing the same crime of funding myriad entities on a basis that is not transparent to taxpayers and open to charges of bias, political manipulation and nepotism. We cannot continue like this. Every dollar from the public purse must be accounted for. It is time to present that policy, Mr Minister.

Friends, fellow journalists and artistes all said Warner was one of the most \\\"beautiful\\\" people they have ever encountered and he will be greatly missed. Warner collapsed while serving as the goal keeper for the Queen's Royal College Old Boys team during a reunion fete match with QRC, St Mary's College, St Benedicts College and others. He was taken to the St Clair Medical Centre nearby, but died while being treated. Warner was said to have had a heart problem Warner's sister, Loma Warner told the Express she was at the match and saw her brother collapse. She said one of the QRC Old Boys is a doctor and tried everything to revive her brother before he was rushed to the hospital. Warner said by the time she ran to the hospital her brother had passed away in spite of the efforts to save him. \\\"They really did everything they could to save him, but it was probably his time. We can at least take comfort in the fact that he died doing something he loved and for the school he loved so much. Like all those QRC Old Boys he thought that QRC was the best thing since sliced bread. Rolph was excited all week over that game,\\\" Warner said. Warner graduated in the class of 1970 from QRC and after trying his hands at various endeavours got into journalism working at the Bomb Newspaper where he immediately specialised in arts and entertainment. From the Bomb, Warner moved over to the Challenge and then the Mirror newspapers. An avid supporter of local culture, Warner developed very close relationships with many artistes, musicians, promoters and others in the arena, yet always maintained the highest level of professionalism. Fellow entertainment journalist, David Cuffy said he met Warner at the Mirror and from day one he was impressed by his work ethic. Cuffy said Warner was always willing to assist artistes beyond just writing an article about them and would often times work with them to get their music out to the public. \\\"I was surprised he went to play football because he was not well. I am very saddened by Rolph's death. I knew him at the Mirror when he was writing entertainment and we would get together, Rolph, Keith Sheppard, Gary Cardinez and myself to talk about the culture. Then he migrated to Toronto where he continued writing on Trinidad's culture.\\\" Asked for a comment Leroy Calliste (Black Stalin) said: \\\"Up to Saturday Rolph called me about midday. He had a friend on a radio station in Boston and we did an interview on the music in general and what the plans are for Carnival over the phone. Just last week I was at a bar in St James and a youth came up and ask me if I knew who he was. I said no and then he told me he is Rolph's son. When I told Rolph about that he was so happy that I met his son.\\\" \\\"He was a soldier for the art form and he fought a good fight. Only Friday night he took out some photos of me by a launching Peter Samuel had. I went to sing a song for Peter and Rolph was there with his camera as usual. He made his mark. We have lost yet another Icon.
