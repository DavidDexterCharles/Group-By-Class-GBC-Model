Commission chairperson, Leela Ramdeen, in a news release yesterday also asked local law enforcers to refrain from excessive force in carrying out their duties. The group said it also feels that short-term measures will not have lasting effects and has called on the Government to also work on long-term crime control. Ramdeen said the group continues to be \\\"deeply concerned\\\" about escalating crime in Trinidad and Tobago. Local Catholics have been asked to offer prayer during this time. \\\"The CCSJ calls on all Catholics, and indeed, the entire national community, to support the measure by offering up prayers in our families, our parishes/places of worship and our communities,\\\" Ramdeen stated. The Government has a role to play but cannot solve all the country's problems on its own, she said, and referred to a remark in 2003 by Archbishop Edward Gilbert, \\\"Everybody has to get involved.\\\" \\\"We appeal to members of the law enforcement agencies to use only appropriate force and to act always in the best interest of citizens,\\\" Ramdeen stated. \\\"The CCSJ is aware that short-term answers to deeper social problems will not work. We call on our Government to develop short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies to deal with crime and violence.\\\" She added that a holistic approach is needed that must address white-collar crime and \\\"dastardly\\\" act of bringing drugs and guns into the country. There must also be support for victims of crime, the prioritisation of rehabilitation programmes for convicts and ex-convicts (within a restorative justice framework) and a keen focus of poverty, employment, housing, healthcare, education and environmental degradation. Ramdeen said a police service that demonstrates integrity, professionalism, compassion and fairness is also needed.

Under the current law, there is a three-strikes rule (a person must have three such offences) before the no-bail provision kicks in. Concerned about the horrifying murders and the apparent spike in the murder toll, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar yesterday summoned heads of the Police Service and Army to a meeting at her Parliament office to discuss the crime situation and proposals aimed at addressing it. After an \\\"intense\\\" meeting, Persad-Bissessar announced that the team had agreed to \\\"increase the visibility\\\" of the joint patrols and road blocks \\\"as of today\\\". The country can expect more road blocks, a significant increase in joint police-army patrols (on foot and vehicular) as well as an increase in air patrols. \\\"I hope that with the increased visibility we can bring a sense of comfort to our citizenry that there are more personnel out there looking after their interests in terms of protective services,\\\" Persad-Bissessar stated. In addition, Government would bring \\\"quickly\\\" to the Parliament legislation for making the possession of firearms and the possession of drugs non-bailable offences. The legislation would also change the sentencing for such offences from discretionary to mandatory, she said. \\\"Such legislation should be relatively simple,\\\" she added. On Thursday night at a press conference at Piarco International Airport shortly after her return from Haiti, the Prime Minister said Government was moving toward the precepting of soldiers. She said there was a reluctance on the part of the former police commissioner (Dwayne Gibbs) to implement such an initiative, and this had slowed down the adoption of this idea. She said the Government had to find creative ways of dealing with the crime situation. Attorney General Anand Ramlogan told the Express he would be taking the note to Cabinet next week for the no-bail provision and for the precepting of soldiers \\\"with police training\\\". \\\"I would be treating with this as a matter of urgency,\\\" he said. Noting that there was a three-strikes provision, he said: \\\"That means that three (or more) lives could be lost before you reach the no-bail provision. You can take a life with a firearm. People are terrified and the situation calls for tough measures. We were treating with the softer (social) side,but you must balance it with tough laws.\\\" He said Justice Minister Christlyn Moore was working assiduously to put in place the infrastructure necessary for the implementation of the Electronic Monitoring Act, the DNA Act and the Act to abolish Preliminary Enquiries. Government's most recent initiatives follow the decapitation of ex-prisoner Learie Ceballo, whose head was left on a bar table in La Romaine; the hog-tying, beating and strangulation of 70-year-old grandmother Carmen Ramjattan;and the murder of Mwali Seales, brother of Sgt Michael Seales, secretary of the Police Service Social and Welfare Association. It also follows the statement by Police Service Commission chairman Ramesh Deosaran that the crime-fighting measures over the past years had failed. Among those present at the meeting with the Prime Minister were Housing Minister Dr Roodal Moonilal, National Security Minister Jack Warner, acting Commissioner of Police Stephen Williams, Major General Kenrick Maharaj and Brigadier Anthony Phillips-Spencer.

And once again we are witness to the familiar frenzied reactions. The Prime Minister summons the National Security Council (NSC) and reads the riot act. The Leader of the Opposition seizes the opportunity to boast that crime will bring down the Government and, for good measure, blames the Prime Minister and the Attorney General for the upsurge in crime. And once again civic groups and citizens in general are quoted as weeping, wailing and gnashing their teeth. The fact is however that we have been here many times before. This current spike in crime may give us a quantitatively higher trend but qualitatively, it is no more or less horrendous or horrific than what happened early last year when we were all appalled by the image of a severed head liming on a table outside a bar in La Romaine. On that occasion I wrote an article in this space entitled Of crime and politics. What I wrote then is as relevant and as pertinent today as it was when written and as it has been for many years now. So I make no apologies for reproducing today much of what I wrote just about one year ago. The issue of crime has once again catapulted itself to the top of the national agenda. It was always on the agenda of course but had been, for a while, superseded in terms of its immediacy by other issues. Now it has come roaring back on the wings of a spate of murders over the last two weeks headlined, if you will, by the absolute horror of the severed head left casually on a tabletop outside a bar in La Romaine, for all to gaze upon. And, as has happened before, there is a sudden flurry of activity from the Government and solemn statements from Government spokespersons and other stakeholders about new initiatives to be undertaken and new strategies to be pursued to fight the scourge Whatever the solutions and strategies being advocated in the wake of this most recent upsurge in crime, it is important that we remind ourselves that the problem of crime and the manifest inability to deal effectively with it did not just surface with this Government. We would recall, under the last PNM administration the launch of Operation Anaconda by then minister of national security Howard Chin Lee. All Anaconda did was to swallow its own creator. He was followed by the hapless Martin Joseph whose only strategy for solving crime seemed to be talking it to death. We remind ourselves of the failed initiatives of the last administration, even as we note the failed initiatives of this administration, because in so doing we might just come to the realisation that the problem of crime in our country is larger than any particular government, any minister of national security and any political party. The problem of crime is a national one and can only be addressed by national initiatives. But what does that statement mean At one level it means that crime is not simply about gangs and guns and drugs and murders. The roots of such phenomena, as frightening as they might be, are to be found in ill-conceived and irresponsible policies perpetrated for a long time now in the economy, in education, in housing and in social and community development. As long as we do not fix these fundamental, national issues we shall, with each generation, keep breeding new recruits into lives of crime. So the solution is national because it requires, in part, long-term national economic and social initiatives. It is, however, also national because it cannot rely only on governments or the police or the army. While these institutions are expected to give the lead in the fight against crime, that fight is also the fight of every law-abiding citizen in the country In this regard one major solution which has been advocated before and which I fully support is a National Service programme, operated under the aegis of the army, which would take our endangered youth from all over the country and place them in an environment in which discipline would be inculcated and skills that would enable them to support themselves taught. Those of us with such skills must be prepared to give freely of our time to help teach and train our young men and women. But in the final analysis, while such long-term and medium-term policies and strategies are vitally necessary the fact remains that we must also deal with the immediate problems of guns and gangs and murders. It is here most above all that the fight against crime must be a national one. Absolutely the first step in making it so is that the issue of crime must cease to be a matter of partisan political bickering and gamesmanship. Our politicians must cease trying to score points against the other party when it comes to crime. That gets us nowhere. Government and Opposition should agree that crime as a matter of gamesmanship is off the table. In this respect a National Crime Policy Board, inclusive of Government, Opposition and civil society members, should be established and be responsible for devising and reviewing all the initiatives in terms of the fight against guns and gangs and murders. Such a National Board is necessary because the fight against crime on the streets is going to demand difficult and unpalatable choices. More than four years ago I wrote the following in this space: To deal effectively with this crime situation, at least in its short-term perspectives, we shall have to make unholy alliances with some of the criminals, we shall have to forgive the vicious and heinous crimes of others of them, we shall have to pay and protect many of them, we shall have to grant amnesty to a whole lot of them, and yes, we shall end up killing a good many of them. That is what I wrote last year and I repeat it again this year because the issue of crime has not changed significantly over the course of the last year or, indeed, for many years now. There is however one change which we need to take note of. Both the acting Commissioner of Police and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Port of Spain, in statements given very early in the New Year, had much to say about the rising anger in the society. But the anger which they have observed is not confined to the underprivileged youth or to the criminal elements alone. Law-abiding citizens of every race and class and region are also becoming increasingly fed-up and increasingly angry. This should have us all very concerned. Time as I have said before, grows short.

Officers from the North Eastern Division Task Force, High Performance Team (HPT) and the Police Canine Unit raided the house at Eighth Avenue, Barataria, an area known for the sale of narcotics., around 4.30 a.m. Up to late yesterday, the suspects, whose ages range between 21 and 31, remained in custody. They were expected to be interviewed by homicide officers before being charged with possession of arms, ammunition and drugs. The exercise was spearheaded by Snr Supt Theophilus Cummings, ASP Kenrick Edwards and Sgt Roger Alexander.

One of the suspects, a 29-year-old man, may have ordered the hit against the family, police said. The entire Dourgah family were killed on May 9, at 1.45 a.m. when an explosion erupted from a car parked close to the entrance of the apartment where Ranchan 'Bellies' Dourgah, 54, lived with his wife, Taramatie Sirju-Dourgah, 56; grandchildren, Nivon Bobby David, 11, and 22-month-old Christianna Dourgah, and their son-in-law, Titus Joel Gabriel, 27.

We have been a resilient people, but the many years of murders have been taking its toll on our collective psyche. In 1994, the year that ttcrime.com began publishing murder statistics, the number of murders stood at 143. It fell all the way down to 93 murders in 1999 then began a steady rise, jumping to 229 in 2003, 386 in 2005, 550 in 2008. Murders dropped to 354 in 2011, but have been rising since, reaching 494 in 2017. Looking at the murder rate per million people, T&T is ranked ninth in the world. The USA is 43rd. I believe the real problem is not murder and guns; it is persistent underdevelopment in geographical areas. Criminal activity and murders are taking place in many parts of the country. Laventille has one of the highest crime rates in the country, with drugs, murders and gangs. This community, which produced many of our most brilliant artists and professionals, remains a sphere of persistent urban underdevelopment. The contrast between this community and its neighbours is the real challenge. Port of Spain is the financial and commercial capital. It is where all the money flows and businesses flourish. On the other side of the Dry River, we have persistent underdevelopment. But, \\u2018behind the bridge\\u2019 used to be the cultural capital of the nation. It is where the pan was born and tambu bambu was innovated. Calypso, soca and so many artforms emerged from these communities. Today, a high number of groups devoted to the arts still operate there, yet no infrastructure exists for the development of the arts. No arts academy, no place for the performing arts to do shows, no resources to assist in the organised development of raw talent. It is not Laventille that has failed: we have failed Laventille. Laventille has more failing schools than other communities. When you belong to a community that is failing and you go to a school where less than 30 per cent pass SEA, it is like being condemned to failure. It is not that children in Laventille, or any poor community for that matter, are less bright or have less talent. It is that poverty also means bad nutrition, less stimulation of the child in infancy and so a child at five is less ready for learning. To solve crime we need to fix education in all failing communities and create some of the best schools suited to the needs of the children offering a path to genuine development. The drug trade is a major actor in the high criminal activity in T&T. It has the power to corrupt and it seems as if no matter who comes into power, the underworld has the experience and capacity to corrupt. This is a major part of the challenge. Some of those employed to protect us, our people and our borders, our laws and our society, have been corrupted, where the corruption is either by direct bribe or threat to their families. The drug trade turns over millions of dollars of illegal money. Paying a couple millions in cash to someone is not a challenge. When we become conscious about crime, there is always a cry for the resumption of capital punishment. Somehow, despite the evidence to the contrary, we believe that the taking of a life by the State is going to solve this very complex challenge of underdevelopment. We seem to need blood spilt to feel satisfied we are solving the problem of crime, while the detection and conviction rates are still woefully low. Many good citizens, desperate for a solution, are saying things are so bad we need someone brave enough to \\u2018take out\\u2019 the criminal element and rid the country of the scourge. This thinking seems to be gaining momentum. This speaks to the desperation and the hopelessness we are experiencing collectively. This is a temptation that we will all regret, if not resisted. Once we begin to ignore the action of the State toward any citizen who may be denied due process of law, and denied a sentence proportionate to the crime, any of us could become victims of unconstrained state power. There are no easy solutions. My proposal is that we do several things at the same time. Those with expertise in matters of national security, which I do not have, need to put forward their proposals and their best ideas implemented. At a minimum, however, we need to ensure, as far as possible, that our police and prisons officers are diligent in doing their duties, and they act with integrity and with restraint appropriate to the dangers they face daily. Secondly, we need swifter dispensing of justice by the courts: in that regard, the recent initiatives of the higher judiciary are to be welcomed. Thirdly, we must support government efforts to \\u2018follow the money\\u2019 and to choke off the supply of funds to the drug trade and to the gangs. This means that each of us has a responsibility to report crime, whether in the streets or in our offices. Most importantly, we need a plan for systematic development of our at-risk communities and in particular the young people within those communities. \\u2014This article first appeared in Catholic News December 9, 2018. \\u2022 The Most Rev Charles J Gordon is Archbishop of port of Spain Some uplifting things occurred in the course of the Emancipation Day festivities at the Nati\\u2026 A possible sedition charge against radio and TV Jaagriti chief executive officer (CEO) and talk show host Sat Maharaj was but one of the issues arising out of the police execution of a search warrant at that media house on April 18, 2019. Trinidad is quickly becoming the murder capital of the world. There have been many calls for a more consistent use of capital punishment by many, and rightly so.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Emma Coronel Aispuro, center, wife of Joaquin \\\"El Chapo\\\" Guzman, arrives to federal court in New York, Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019. A jury is deliberating at the U.S. trial of the infamous Mexican drug lord. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Mexico's most notorious drug lord, Joaquin \\\"El Chapo\\\" Guzman, was convicted Tuesday of running an industrial-scale smuggling operation after a three-month trial packed with Hollywood-style tales of grisly killings, political payoffs, cocaine hidden in jalapeno cans, jewel-encrusted guns and a naked escape with his mistress through a tunnel. Guzman faced a drumbeat of drug-trafficking and conspiracy convictions that could put the 61-year-old escape artist behind bars for decades in a maximum-security U.S. prison selected to thwart another one of the breakouts that embarrassed his native country. New York jurors whose identities were kept secret reached a verdict after deliberating six days in the expansive case, sorting through what authorities called an \\\"avalanche\\\" of evidence gathered since the late 1980s that Guzman and his murderous Sinaloa drug cartel made billions in profits by smuggling tons of cocaine, heroin, meth and marijuana into the U.S. Evidence showed drugs poured into the U.S. through secret tunnels or hidden in tanker trucks, concealed in the undercarriage of passenger cars and packed in rail cars passing through legitimate points of entry \\u2014 suggesting that a border wall wouldn't be much of a worry. The prosecution's case against Guzman, a roughly 5\\u00bd-foot figure whose nickname translates to \\\"Shorty,\\\" included the testimony of several turncoats and other witnesses. Among them were Guzman's former Sinaloa lieutenants, a computer encryption expert and a Colombian cocaine supplier who underwent extreme plastic surgery to disguise his appearance. One Sinaloa insider described Mexican workers getting contact highs while packing cocaine into thousands of jalapeno cans \\u2014 shipments that totaled 25 to 30 tons of cocaine worth $500 million each year. Another testified how Guzman sometimes acted as his own sicario, or hitman, punishing a Sinaloan who dared to work for another cartel by kidnapping him, beating and shooting him and having his men bury the victim while he was still alive, gasping for air. The defense case lasted just half an hour. Guzman's lawyers did not deny his crimes as much as argue he was a fall guy for government witnesses who were more evil than he was. Defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman urged the jury in closing arguments not to believe government witnesses who \\\"lie, steal, cheat, deal drugs and kill people.\\\" Deliberations were complicated by the trial's vast scope. Jurors were tasked with making 53 decisions about whether prosecutors have proven different elements of the case. The trial cast a harsh glare on the corruption that allowed the cartel to flourish. Colombian trafficker Alex Cifuentes caused a stir by testifying that former Mexican President Enrique Pe\\u00f1a Nieto took a $100 million bribe from Guzman. Pe\\u00f1a Nieto denied it, but the allegation fit a theme: politicians, army commanders, police and prosecutors, all on the take. The tension at times was cut by some of the trial's sideshows, such as the sight of Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, showing up in matching burgundy velvet blazers in a gesture of solidarity. Another day, a Chapo-size actor who played the kingpin in the TV series \\\"Narcos: Mexico\\\" came to watch, telling reporters that seeing the defendant flash him a smile was \\\"surreal.\\\" While the trial was dominated by Guzman's persona as a near-mythical outlaw who carried a diamond-encrusted handgun and stayed one step ahead of the law, the jury never heard from Guzman himself, except when he told the judge he wouldn't testify. But his sing-songy voice filled the courtroom, thanks to recordings of intercepted phone calls. \\\"Amigo!\\\" he said to a cartel distributor in Chicago. \\\"Here at your service.\\\" One of the trial's most memorable tales came from girlfriend Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, who testified she was in bed in a safe house with an on-the-run Guzman in 2014 when Mexican marines started breaking down his door. She said Guzman led her to a trap door beneath a bathtub that opened up to a tunnel that allowed them to escape. Asked what he was wearing, she replied: \\\"He was naked. He took off running. He left us behind.\\\" The defendant had previously escaped from jail by hiding in a laundry bin in 2001. He then got an escort from crooked police officers into Mexico City before retreating to one of his many mountainside hideaways. In 2014, he pulled off another jail break, escaping through a mile-long lighted tunnel on a motorcycle on rails. Even when Guzman was recaptured in 2016 before his extradition to the United States, he was plotting another escape, prosecutor Andrea Goldbarg said in closing arguments. \\\"Why? Because he is guilty and he never wanted to be in a position where he would have to answer for his crimes,\\\" she told the jury. \\\"He wanted to avoid sitting right there.

The motive for most of these murders seems to be gang-related or drug-related, with guns being the weapon of choice. As matter of fact, gangsters are able to get guns that are more sophisticated than those used by the protective services. It is basic public knowledge how these weapons are entering this beloved twin-island republic and yet still no effective measure is being implemented to secure our borders. Why What are those in authority waiting for It seems that the only way Trinidad and Tobago 'smaritime borders would be effectively protected would be with the aid of the ruler of the seven seas \\u2014 Aquaman. The people who are committing these heinous crimes are not being arrested, charged and brought before the courts by the agency tasked with this responsibility. It can be argued that a single individual could have committed more than one murder. It is no secret that the main problem of our hard working Police Service is that its detection rate is too low, especially regarding murders. However, those in authority are not administering effective strategies, methods or adopting specialised training to help develop and strengthen the Police Service's detecting skills. It has become evident that the only way the police would get out of its predicament is with the assistance from the Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader, the World's Greatest Detective \\u2014 Batman. There is a saying that \\u201cjustice delayed is justice denied\\u201d, yet still in this twin-island republic the length of time it takes for a criminal trial to be completed can amount to from 15 to 20 years. Prisoners who are presumed innocent may sense that they are not being given a fair and equal chance in the justice system, which can in turn foster more criminality. At the opening of nearly every law term the Chief Justice always highlights the positives, the negatives and makes appeals and list things the Judiciary needs to make the delivery of justice faster. However the justice system is still moving at a snail pace. Therefore it seems that for the judiciary to effectively resolve disputes and to test and enforce laws in a fair and rational manner would only be with the assistance of an unsound hero \\u2014 Judge Dredd. Crime in Trinidad and Tobago is spiralling out of control. It has become the norm where every day a murder is committed or a body is found dumped somewhere. Yet still, those in authority are not implementing any serious solutions to help alleviate the escalating crime problem. Instead during this period, baseless rhetoric and the blame game seem be the order of the day. Overturning this crime situation seems insurmountable. In the fight against crime, it seems more optimistic right now to wait on super heroes than on those in authority.

The revamping of the station takes effect today and will see recent recruits along with Special Reserve Police taking up posts at the station. The officers who have been transferred were ordered back into uniform and will resume duties at Pinto Police Post, San Rafael Police Station and other stations in0 the Eastern Division. Five officers who were recently transferred to the St Joseph Police Station will continue duties there. The transfers took effect following Saturday's find of drugs, a cache of seven guns and a large quantity of ammunition in the ceiling of the St Joseph station. Following the find, Acting Commissioner of Police James Philbert mandated ASP John Martinez to investigate the matter. The find was made on Saturday after officers of the Criminal Investigative Unit (CIU) raided the station. The station was then placed on a temporary lock-down. Sources say the senior officer in whose office the find was made has been transferred to the Tunapuna Police Station while the Inspector has taken up duty at the Arima Police Station. Sources say that information passed on to CIU stated that the items were confiscated in raids and not lodged into evidence. The information about the items, a source said, was then passed on to a senior officer who heads a tactical unit in the Northern Division. The senior officer who has 12 years service and has been attached to the Eastern Division then alerted his seniors in the Port of Spain Division to what was taking place. Following the discovery two constables have been transferred to the tactical unit. However, several affected officers have voiced their displeasure over the transfers, deeming them unfair. \\\"Officers who recently came out on leave have also been transferred and this is not fair,\\\" one officer said. Noting there have been unscrupulous dealings within the station over a period of time involving police officers, the officer claimed senior officials were aware of this and have turned a blind eye to the matter. Sources say with the ongoing investigation they expect the homes of several police officers to be searched. Adding its voice to the issue, the Trinidad and Tobago Chamber of Industry and Commerce called on Philbert to \\\"act decisively to weed out all corrupt practices in the Police Service if he wants to build public confidence and trust in his officers.\\\" In a release issued yesterday, Chamber president Angella Persad said the confiscation of \\\"guns, ammunition and drugs found hidden in the ceiling of the St Joseph Police Station is cause for serious alarm and concern among members of the public.\\\" \\\"It is imperative that offending officers are brought to justice post haste and penalised to the full extent of the law with maximum accountability and transparency of the public,\\\" she said.

At the same time, jumping the gun can be ill-advised, especially if it encourages complacency in the ongoing battle to bring criminal activity down to manageable levels. The People's Partnership has been in office for less than four months, which is far too short a period to reveal any pattern in crime statistics. Its claims of success in turning around crime are thus premature. Even acting Police Commissioner Stephen Williams's eight-month comparisons, between selected indicators for January to August this year and the corresponding period last year, may not be statistically significant. Past data have shown similar promising declines which were mocked by the increased year-end totals. The Police Service's figures, for example, showed no murders in January 2008, but that year ended with 547 homicides, which was a 40 per cent increase over the 2007 total. The current decline in robberies and vehicle thefts may be similarly reversed if these crimes spike over the remaining months of 2010. Additionally, there is the question of whether police statistics reflect the true state of the country. The Police Service can only collate reported crimes, but the Central Statistical Office's data show that a significant percentage of crimes go unreported. One survey carried out by criminologist Prof Ramesh Deosaran also revealed that two out of every three crimes may never be recorded by the police. Only if such victims' surveys are done on an annual basis can the authorities estimate the real levels of crime. Moreover, the main reason given by victims for not reporting crimes is lack of confidence in the police. In this regard, it is especially encouraging that acting Commissioner Williams moved with such decisive speed to stop the rot with the Repeat Offenders Task Force, immediately sending 35 officers on leave, pending investigation into the allegations made against them. This is a much-needed improvement over the lack of action (beyond transferring officers) typically displayed when, to cite just one egregious incident, guns and drugs were found in the ceiling of the St Joseph Police Station. If such disciplinary action can be sustained and followed through, a resulting clean-out of police evildoers will do much to restore citizens' confidence and increase the morale of those good officers who are undermined by the heavy presence of rotten eggs among their colleagues. As has been the case with these apparent declines before, the challenge is to sustain the reduction, without any let-up in the pressure on what caused the initial successes. The police can be assured that, if they have indeed begun to win the fight against crime, they will have the support of law-abiding citizens, and their contributions to further successes.

The report also recommended National Service Scheme (involving vocational institutions, youth camps and correctional institutions). This is one of the recommendations of the report No Time to Quit Engaging Youth at Risk, which was prepared by Prof Selwyn Ryan, Dr Indira Rampersad, Dr Marjorie Thorpe and Dr Lennox Bernard, which was tabled in the House of Representatives yesterday at Tower D, International Waterfront Centre, Port of Spain. Among the recommendations for dealing with the drug crisis and crime in the report are: 1) the Ministry of National Security \\\"diligently\\\" pursue white-collar criminals and that laws should be instituted to deal with campaign financing, \\\"whereby there should be limits to financing; transparency in recording financing, thus holding political parties to greater accountability\\\". The report also recommended national and regional policies which facilitate in-depth financial investigations and asset seizures to seize profits from corruption rings, drug traffickers and organised crime groups. It recommends employment creation should be considered to compensate for job losses in Central Trinidad due to the closure of Caroni (1975) Ltd, recreational facilities and education and training to alleviate a growing alcohol abuse and domestic violence problem in Central Trinidad. The report also suggests the use of advanced technology to intercept air and sea drug traffickers, more integration and co-operation among stakeholder agencies (religious, non-governmental organisations, security agencies, etc) and more in-depth research to identify the at-risk communities and their causes and consequences. The report also suggest the institution of a parole system, Government increase in subventions to young offenders' institutions, establish an institution for young female offenders and family courts in all communities, In its general findings, the report found while African men are insecure economically, Indian men have an \\\"identity crisis\\\". Both groups are also at risk. It found while black women are doing less well than women of Indian and other ethnic minorities, they generally are doing better than black boys. It also found that the data across the Caribbean showed economic insecurities of many black males had given rise to certain kinds of hypermasculine behaviours, such as the use of violent and coarse language, having many women, with monogamy being seen as a sign of weakness. Looking at the emergence of criminal gangs, the report found the gangs were fuelled by drugs but most young boys joined the gangs for \\\"benign reasons\\\". \\\"Some...did so because they valued the reputations, respect and...believe they had acquired the power and esteem which they longed and hoped for, in order to gain access to women's bodies.... The prizes (of gang membership) were flashy clothes, souped-up cars, hot women, a reputation for meanness and, most important, ownership of one of the many brand-name guns that are popular in the ghetto,\\\" Ryan said. He added, however, some were persuaded to join gangs out of fear of the consequences for not doing so, and some were known to have been killed because they refused to join the gang or wanted to get out since the fear is that those who gave up membership might become \\\"snitchers\\\" to the police. \\\"Many also claim the gangs provided them with the homes and sodalities (brotherhood) which they did not get at home or in the mainstream community,\\\" Ryan said. Focusing on the East Port of Spain areas, a hotbed of crime, Ryan said the general approach of all political parties has been to \\\"throw money\\\" at the problem of poverty and dispossession. He also noted that as allocations to the Unemployment Relief Programme (URP) increased, so did the homicides.The recommendations included the endorsing of the plan to regenerate East Port of Spain. But Rampersad said the perception that young black males alone were at risk was an erroneous one. She noted the East Indian home was a natural environment for drinking. \\\"Indian children are exposed to alcohol from quite early as their elders often send them, sometimes from age five, for a \\\"pint or nip of puncheon\\\" in the village shops. Rampersad added that alcohol consumption among East Indian males also seemed to have stemmed from the \\\"young Indian men in Central Trinidad...facing a self-emasculating identity crisis\\\" of \\\"finding themselves in a diverse society traditionally dominated by the more assertive and aggressive Afro-Trinidadian, who typifies what has traditionally been promoted as males\\\". She said in recent times, this emasculation has been compounded by the now highly educated population of independent, Indo-Trinidadian women who threaten the stability of the traditional Indian home where women were predominantly housewives. Rampersad said the contention is this has resulted in higher rates of domestic violence and divorce as the men resort to \\\"rum\\\". \\\"The woman, and at times even the children, naturally become helpless victims of domestic abuse, which sometimes ends in suicide and homicide,\\\" she noted. She also said some social scientists believed there was a link between chutney lyrics and violence. She said the crisis among East Indians then was generally one of alcohol abuse and domestic violence. However, Ryan said the Indian family remained more resilient and risk-resistant than its Afro-Trinidadian counterpart and had so far been better able to address the issues that afflict the creole (black) family. \\\"The evidence, such as it is, points to the conclusion that the Indian family, extended and nuclear, is still viable and support their young members while the single parent is still prevalent in 'hot-spot' type communities....While they were at risk for several social pathologies, Indo-Trinidadian youths are not as seriously at risk as a group. \\\"What the figures show is that Indo-Trinidadians were less likely to live in 'hot-spot' neighbourhoods where handguns and drugs were easily available than Afro-Trinidadians and would be less likely to be affected negatively by these facts.\\\" Ryan said the data however confirmed that young black males are not all underachievers. \\\"Indeed, the majority do well as they have always done,\\\" he said. He noted that black males were part of a generation which is in crisis all over the world where women are outperforming men in every field. But he stressed: \\\"Poor blacks have to be enabled to catch up and compete. The road ahead will be long and winding, but it is one that the entire society has to take preemptively. Not to do so is to court unsustainable social conflict which may occur sooner rather than later,\\\" he said.

    "{\"SOURCE\": \"https://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/local/of-crime-and-politics/article_136da91a-ae45-5a41-a324-eeb8b2b0a919.html\", \"TITLE\": \" Of crime and politics \", \"DATE\": \"Feb 23, 2013 \", \"CONTENT\": \" The issue of crime has once again catapulted itself to the top of the national agenda. It was always on the agenda of course but had been, for a while, superseded in terms of its immediacy by other issues. Now it has come roaring back on the wings of a spate of murders over the last two weeks headlined, if you will, by the absolute horror of the severed head left casually on a tabletop outside a bar in La Romaine, for all to gaze upon. And, as has happened before, there is a sudden flurry of activity from the Government and solemn statements from Government spokespersons and other stakeholders about new initiatives to be undertaken and new strategies to be pursued to fight the scourge. So we are now to make firearms and drug possession non-bailable offences. The Police Service, according to the chairman of the Police Service Commission, needs a comprehensive overhaul. And the Flying Squad flies again, only this time cloaked in apparent invisibility. Whatever the solutions and strategies being advocated in the wake of this most recent upsurge in crime, it is important that we remind ourselves that the problem of crime and the manifest inability to deal effectively with it did not just surface with this Government. We would recall, under the last People's National Movement administration, the launch of Project Anaconda by then minister of national security Howard Chin Lee. All \\\"Anaconda\\\" did was to swallow its own creator. He was followed by the hapless Martin Joseph, whose only strategy for solving crime seemed to be talking it to death. We remind ourselves of the failed initiatives of the last administration, even as we note the failed initiatives of this administration, because in so doing we might just come to the realisation that the problem of crime in our country is larger than any particular government, any minister of national security and any political party. The problem of crime is a national one and can only be addressed by national initiatives. But what does that statement mean At one level, it means crime is not simply about gangs and guns and drugs and murders. The roots of such phenomena, as frightening as they might be, are to be found in ill-conceived and irresponsible policies perpetrated for a long time now in the economy, in education, in housing and in social and community development. As long as we do not fix these fundamental national issues, we shall, with each generation, keep breeding new recruits into lives of crime. So the solution is national because it requires, in part, long-term national economic and social initiatives. It is, however, also national because it cannot rely only on governments or the police or the army. While these institutions are expected to give the lead in the fight against crime, that fight is also the fight of every law-abiding citizen. Each of us also has the responsibility not only to live our lives in such a way as to set an example for correct conduct and the propagation of the values of respect for all, but we also must be prepared to give of our time, our energies and our resources in any effort to wean our youth away from crime to lives of dignity and self-respect. In this regard, one major solution which has been advocated before and which I fully support is a national service programme, operated under the aegis of the army, which would take our endangered youth from all over the country and place them in an environment in which discipline would be inculcated and skills taught that would enable them to support themselves. Those of us with such skills must be prepared to give freely of our time to help teach and train our young men and women. But in the final analysis, while such long-term and medium-term policies and strategies are vitally necessary, the fact remains that we must also deal with the immediate problems of guns and gangs and murders. It is here, above all, that the fight against crime must be a national one. Absolutely the first step in making it so is that the issue of crime must cease to be a matter of partisan political bickering and gamesmanship. Our politicians must cease trying to score points against the other party when it comes to crime. That gets us nowhere. The Government and Opposition should agree that crime as a matter of gamesmanship is off the table. In this respect, a National Crime Policy Board, inclusive of Government, Opposition and civil society members, should be established and be responsible for devising and reviewing all the initiatives in terms of the fight against guns and gangs and murders. Such a national board is necessary because the fight against crime on the streets is going to demand difficult and unpalatable choices. More than four years ago, I wrote the following in this column: \\\"To deal effectively with this crime situation, at least in its short-term perspectives, we shall have to make unholy alliances with some of the criminals, we shall have to forgive the vicious and heinous crimes of others among them, we shall have to pay and protect many of them, we shall have to grant amnesty to a whole lot of them, and yes, we shall end up killing a good many of them.\\\" Four years later I see no cogent reason to change a single word in that prescription. There is no other choice. But for it to happen we must take the toxic partisan politics out of the equation. No government, of whatever party, is going to make those difficult decisions on its own and open itself up to the vilification of its opponents. And without such difficult decisions, we will not solve our crime problem. It is as simple as that. And who knows, maybe, if we can raise the level of our politics in seeking to deal with crime, we may just learn how to raise the level of our politics generally.

Officers from the North Eastern Division Task Force, High Performance Team (HPT) and the Police Canine Unit raided the house at Eighth Avenue, Barataria, an area known for the sale of narcotics., around 4.30 a.m. Up to late yesterday, the suspects, whose ages range between 21 and 31, remained in custody. They were expected to be interviewed by homicide officers before being charged with possession of arms, ammunition and drugs. The exercise was spearheaded by Snr Supt Theophilus Cummings, ASP Kenrick Edwards and Sgt Roger Alexander. During the exercise, police found two 9mm pistols, one of which belongs to the T&T Police Service; 110 rounds of assorted ammunition; one kilogramme of compressed marijuana; a bullet proof vest; and a licence plate - registration number PCD 4983. One of the suspects, a 29-year-old man, may have ordered the hit against the family, police said. The entire Dourgah family were killed on May 9, at 1.45 a.m. when an explosion erupted from a car parked close to the entrance of the apartment where Ranchan 'Bellies' Dourgah, 54, lived with his wife, Taramatie Sirju-Dourgah, 56; grandchildren, Nivon Bobby David, 11, and 22-month-old Christianna Dourgah, and their son-in-law, Titus Joel Gabriel, 27. The family was trapped in their home after a fire was triggered by the loud explosion. A post mortem revealed the victims died from smoke inhalation and Crime Scene Investigators said the fire was deliberately set. Police said their investigation had pointed to a drug link, but the Dourgah's relatives have disputed this, insisting they were not involved with drugs or gangs.

Police statistics show that we have had cycles of increased violence causing public panic over several periods during the last administration. As recently as July 2015, there were 48 homicides recorded. Recent panic, fuelled by remarks of certain ministers in opposition, leads one to wonder whether over the past five years, no one in Government noticed that gangs were wreaking havoc on communities, taking the lives of innocent bystanders, robbing, murdering, extorting and trafficking in guns, drugs and ammunition. Then prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar in announcing a limited state of emergency, had acknowledged that the SOE was a response that was intended to halt \\\"the current spike in gang activity and crime in general \\u2026.\\\" ? ? IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

At Couva last Thursday, for example, I arrived at the People's Partnership (PP) in time to hear Rudy Moonilal (I believe) and Jack Warner refer to the \\\"8,000 people gathered here tonight\\\". If there were 3,000 persons, the PP could count itself lucky. On returning to my vehicle and listening on the radio, this time to the People's National Movement (PNM) in Chaguanas, I heard PNM leader Patrick Manning give what he said was a police report on the PP meeting: 1,800 people. And the PNM's numbers in Chaguanas No less than 6,000, Manning said. I immediately halved that and factored half-of-the-half as constituents from afar bussed into the heartland. Gross over-estimation of crowds at such meetings is nothing new. Crackpots like Baboolalsingh who campaigned in the 1970s would have had no one else but his wife attending his \\\"meetings\\\". Clearly, he could not inflate numbers. But what of the 40,000 the PP claimed to have attracted in a car park (and its periphery) that can barely hold 15,000, \\\"jam-packed\\\", as Trinis would say The PNM's Ralph Maraj runs out of \\\"zeros\\\" when he chairs meetings which fewer than 3,000 attend. In today's glitzy, flag-waving campaign, gross over-estimation of crowds can hurt both candidates and supporters come elections day. They would expect huge turnouts and massive victories, only to be disappointed when bogus numbers fail to materialise in votes. This is not to suggest the two main contenders won't rally significant support on polling day. Live telecast and radio broadcast of almost every meeting mean that more people are \\\"attending\\\" meetings from the comfort of their homes. Given the hype surrounding these uncalled-for elections, I shan't be surprised if voter-turnout on May 24 is more than 60 per cent. At this stage, I maintain that the race is a close onewhich is bad news for Mr Manning. Let's face it: Kamla and the PP have nothing to lose, since the PNM will hardly win any of the 15 constituencies the United National Congress (UNC) currently holds. This suggests that Patrick could be in trouble, whatever the results of the elections. But let us wait until the ballots are counted before calling this one. I promised readers to deal with some of the main issues that the parties should address, issues that impact on the entire population. Runaway crime remains at the top of the list. The PNM's approach is interesting. Mr Manning is convinced that rampant crime has one root causedrug trafficking and drug dealing. He thinks all gang-related murders are hinged on the battle for \\\"drug turf\\\". I think he is wrong. He pins almost all his crime-fighting hopes on keeping our porous borders secure. To this end, he boasts of an all-seeing airship, radar that covers 360-degrees around our islands, and the various FPBs and OPVs the Coast Guard is being equipped with. In my view, his analysis is seriously flawed. I agree that drug trafficking and the concomitant illegal arms trade must be seriously addressed. But I also argue that drug-runners from Venezuela and Colombia who use this country mainly as a transhipment point (drug abuse has declined in this country) can get around all the systems the PM is banking on. Maybe Manning should use his OAS clout to get some advice from Mexico's President Calderon. Drug-runners have turned parts of that country into a veritable war zone. When bandits in their hunt for quick cash commit robberies by the scores, if not hundreds, on a daily basis, where is the drug connection These are no-goods whose sole aim is to relieve law-abiding citizens of their property. If they must, they would kill in pursuit of their aims. Besides gold and cash, cellphones and laptop computers are prized loot. They sell these items easily to people without consciences, people who do not care if blood was spilt in the process, as long as they get \\\"ah bargain\\\". Whereas non-gang-related murders are fewer, the crimes described above are rampant. What is the connection between illegal drugs and robberies or burglaries These criminals are driven by a combination of poverty, greed, materialism and consumerism. They may also use drugs, but that's incidental to their evil designs. Kamla's crime-busting strategy begins with \\\"holding the police accountable for the effective delivery of their services (and) establishing clear and measurable benchmarks for crime reduction and containment.\\\" How does she propose to effect such changes in a service in which officers are insulated by archaic regulations She proposes, too, \\\"to set up a real time centralised system for tracking crime. This will include GPS technology in every police vehicle.\\\" With guns, drugs and other court exhibits disappearing from police custody with alarming frequency, what's to say GPS sets won't mysteriously disappear from police vehicles And GPS bracelets for offenders on probation Is she ready to face Ramesh Maharaj and Anand Ramlogan in court There are no quick-fix solutions to our crime problems. Or should I say there are, but they may be unpalatable to all but those who believe the end, quite literally, justifies the means. I say no more.

The 436-page report, titled \\\"No Time to Quit: Engaging Youth At Risk\\\", was laid in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister on March 22, 2013. And while there has been no public pronouncement from the Government on the status of the report, even as the crime rate escalates daily\\u2014with 32 murders so far for the year\\u2014Ryan said nobody from the Government has spoken with him or his team who authored the report. \\\"I have had no communication whatsoever from anyone in an official position on this matter since we submitted. So like you, I don't know what has happened since,\\\" Ryan told the Sunday Express last week. Earlier this month, interim leader of the Independent Liberal Party (ILP) Jack Warner placed a question on the Order Paper to Persad-Bissessar, asking her to indicate the quantity of money paid by the State to each mem- ber of the Ryan Committee and to also indicate which of the recommendations have been implemented, and which have not. The detailed report was laid in Parliament while Warner was still national security minister. Warner resigned from the Cabinet on April 20 last year. The question was due to be answered last Friday but because of insuf- ficient time, it was not, the Sunday Express learned. The Sunday Express was informed, however, the Government has been quietly implementing some of the measures. A well-placed source said: \\\"The report has been digested and pieced out to the various ministries to look at the recommendations and to implement them in their own areas, as well as to intensify our work in areas that we already started.\\\" The Sunday Express also learned ex-Caroni Ltd workers, who were victims of joblessness and economic depression following the closure of the sugar factory, are receiving some attention, consistent with the recommendations of the report. In its executive summary, the Ryan Committee noted, \\\"The propensity to crime resulted from certain conditions including broken and dysfunctional families, juvenile delinquency, peer rejection, failure or disruptive behaviour at school, gang membership and incarceration. This is matched by the availability of drugs, numerous opportunities for young men to gravitate to crime as an easy but dangerous way to earn a living, and a marked change in societal values over the last six decades since the promise of independence.\\\" It suggested the solutions require a commitment to short-term actions, coupled with sustained, long-term programmes. \\\"They (the solutions) speak to the need for integrated governance, community empowerment, a comprehensive youth-development policy and a social contract that espouses poverty eradication, adequate housing, an improved education system, family support, health and wellness, and en- riching leisure and creative activities.\\\" The report found young Afro-Trinidadian men in hotspot communities were more predisposed to being caught in the criminal world of illegal drugs, guns and violent crime if something were not done to curb the problem. As well, it spoke of the need for reform of the police and prison systems and the establishment of a National Service Scheme. As it relates to the drug crisis and crime, the committee recommended the Ministry of National Security should diligently pursue white-collar criminals from all sectors of the society, including law enforcement officials. It also recommended: \\\"Laws should be instituted to deal with campaign financing\\u2014and more resources be deployed for fighting corruption, mon- ey laundering and embezzlement, and checks and balances instituted to keep high-ranking officials, including politicians, in line.\\\" National Security Minister Gary Griffith would not comment on what recommendations have been implemented under his ministry, saying he would \\\"prefer if the Prime Minister responded to any questions about that\\\".

Although the detection rate for serious crimes is only one of a number of factors to indicate whether we are winning the war against crime, it can be used to assess our status in the fight and what are our chances of success. As it stands right now, the detection rate is abysmally low and despite all the gun talk from national security ministers past and present, the situation remains one of serious concern. The average detection rate for murder for the period January to June 2014 is 14 per cent. For the same period, the detection rates for wounding and shootings, general larceny and larceny of motor vehicles were 14 per cent, 8.4 per cent and six per cent respectively. The overall average detection rate for serious crimes was 20 per cent. These figures cannot be considered acceptable and even the most crafty spin doctor would find it impossible to convert this glaring failure into a modest success story. That having been said, the focus must be to overcome the challenges faced by all organisations involved in any aspect of law enforcement. Of course the Police Service would be the first and most important institution that must be analysed. And while there is yet another attempt being made to audit the service, there is sufficient information gathered over the decades that provides helpful data as to the measures that ought to be implemented to restore public trust and confidence. It is unfortunate that the inefficiencies in the Police Service have clouded the outstanding work of hundreds of dedicated officers who remained committed to their oaths and performed commendably. It is for that reason that all efforts should be made to give to those institutions charged with the responsibility to remove the rogue elements in the Police Service the powers and resources needed to fulfill their respective statutory mandates. But far too often in the discussion about law enforcement, it is forgotten that there are other entities responsible for detecting crime and bringing perpetrators to justice. These entities include but are not limited to Customs and Excise, the Defence Force, Prisons and Immigration. These institutions not only need to be properly resourced, but also must have robust internal and external mechanisms to root out any corrupt elements that may exist within. Yet another challenge in law enforcement is the great disconnect among the major players involved in gathering information and sharing intelligence. It is not doubted that there is technology that allows intelligence to be obtained from several institutions that have been given the requisite capacity to do so, but without clear channels and protocols in place to manage and disseminate such intelligence, there is no pro-active approach to prevent crimes. With all the money that has been committed over the years to purchase equipment to fight crime and all the scientific methods that can be used to prevent criminal activity and solve crimes, there is really no justifiable excuse for the lack of progress over the last decade. The decision to dismantle the Special Anti-Crime Unit (SAUTT) without another agency to perform the multiple roles played by SAUTT is still the subject of active debate. SAUTT ought never to have been flung outside the window without a thorough assessment of the benefits derived from its existence. I do not condone the operation of any entity that is perceived to act outside of the law or is hamstrung because it is not given the legal clothing necessary to be fully operational. But I ask, what was done with all the intelligence\\u2014as opposed to information\\u2014 gathered by SAUTT during the almost six years of its operation Surely during that time, its experts and officers collected important data about criminal activity, such as gangs and gang operations, drug lords and international drug suppliers. Where is this intelligence and can we be assured that it was not simply dumped or is in the wrong hands And what is the organisation that has replaced SAUTT and where is the training facility for civilians who want to learn investigative skills without going through the Police Service It is often forgotten that SAUTT was also a national training centre for crime scene investigation and related skills. SAUTT also performed ballistic testing and fingerprint analysis which eased the burden placed on the Forensic Science Centre which to date is inundated with exhibits, especially firearms, that form part of cases before the courts or matters being investigated.

The most infamous of all, and the historical origination of the phrase, fiddling while Rome burns, is the Roman Emperor Nero who allegedly played the violin while the city of Rome tragically burned.While this story has been around for over 2,000 years, historians have found several flaws with its details. Not the least among them is that the violin was not yet invented at that point in history. But, we may never know if Nero really fiddled while the city burned, since history is written by the victors.Notwithstanding its historical date of origin, the phrase is still apt in Trinidad and Tobago today. While the Government continues on its uninspired course of dealing with minor issues confronting the nationsuch as: who does the ganja allegedly found at the Prime Ministers residence belong to And why is Jack Warner being extradited, but Ish Galbaransingh and Steve Ferguson were notmajor problems continue unabated.Among the major issues facing us, crime is high on the list even though the police and the Government point to statistics that show a decrease in major crimes. However, if you are a victim of crime, the decrease in crime is not a statistic that gives you any comfort.Furthermore, road accidents and deaths continue, but we should not be unduly concerned because, they tell us, statistically road fatalities are down. The list of problems plaguing the nation seems endless: the use of illegal drugs; proliferation of illegal guns; the inability of the police to enforce the laws of the roadssuch as speeding, not stopping at stop signs and breaking practically every traffic lawis rampant throughout the nation. The attempts by the Government to combat crime and road fatalities include building new police stations, hiring more police officers and purchasing police vehicles. But is that enough What about training Police officers need to be trained to know enough about the laws of the country so that they can effectively enforce them. There is no point in having laws if they are flouted with impunity. Therefore, I am calling on the Government and the acting Police Commissioner to stop fiddling with insignificant happenstance.Depending on who wins the upcoming general election, the victors will give us their interpretation of what happened over the years to bring us to this sad point in the history of Trinidad and Tobago.If we elect the Peoples National Movement, it will waste precious resources on changing course while it tries to do things its way, as it sets out to show how irrelevant the Peoples Partnership Government was. That type of pointing-fingers governance will continue in perpetuity because that is the system of government we have.Have our leaders failed us, or are we asking them to perform miracles while we do very little, if anything, to turn this country into the state of nirvana we should be trying to attainUntil the populace realises that, we just cannot wake up from our stupor to vote every five years and then fall back into a slumber while we wait for the next election. We will continue this fall from grace that brought us to this state of misery that we now own.We have to rise up and demand change from our Government, or our Government will continue to take us down the path we have been on, from where there is no redemption. Politicians, stop fiddling, the country is burning!Rex ChookolingoMaraval IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

Ramadhar told the Express the proposal made last week by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar will deny the right to freedom of individuals charged and should therefore be accompanied by a means to swift justice, such as a drug and gun night court. Persad-Bissessar said last week that Government's concern about Trinidad and Tobago's high murder rate had led to a proposal to quickly bring to Parliament legislation that would make the possession of drugs and guns a non-bailable offence. The legislation would also change the sentencing for such offences from discretionary to mandatory, she said, stating at the time, \\\"Such legislation should be relatively simple.\\\" The proposal came out of an emergency meeting between the Prime Minister and heads of the protective services. Persad-Bissessar said the Government was moving towards the precepting of soldiers and there was a reluctance on the part of former police commissioner Dwayne Gibbs to implement such an initiative. Attorney General Anand Ramlogan later told the Express he would be taking the note to Cabinet this week for the no-bail provision and for the precepting of soldiers \\\"with police training\\\". Ramadhar said yesterday he intends to suggest a rounded approach to the proposal to his Cabinet colleagues. \\\"The proposal to deny bail to those who are found in possession of drugs and guns requires careful consideration,\\\" he said in a statement to the Express. \\\"As we consider this measure, it is imperative that we also deal with issues surrounding the administration of justice so as to ensure that if we deny people's right to freedom, that they are assured of swift adjudication of their matters. \\\"In that regard, we may need to look at the simultaneous implementation of drug and gun court, and night court, to look at these matters to ensure that people who are accused are not held for unreasonable, lengthy periods of time without trial. \\\"In an attempt to ensure that the desired outcome is met, I would suggest to my colleagues that if we considered this proposal, we consider it with a sunset clause, which will make it law for a defined period of time, such as one year, so that it does not become permanent.\\\" Ramadhar said the State must also deal with gang leaders and not just the \\\"soldiers\\\", if it is to achieve a sustainable reduction in crime. \\\"Therefore, it is my view that we should consider adding money laundering to the list of non-bailable offences and intensify our efforts to go after those who run the criminal activity in our society,\\\" he said. \\\"I will continue to advocate for the strengthening of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the Board of Inland Revenue to ensure that we have the necessary skills and resources to aggressively go after those who are the real perpetrators of mayhem in our society.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Sookhai was elected Chamber president in November 2013 and leads a 14-member board and about 200 registered members. He shared his vision, plans and concerns with the Business Express in an interview at his office at Sookhais Diesel Service, Biljah Road, Chaguanas last Thursday. Sookhai has a Bachelors degree in computer engineering and has been trained internationally in the repair of diesel fuel injection systems. On Thursday as this interview was being conducted, schoolteacher Dian Paladee was found murdered by her husband Sanjeev Rambarran who then killed himself. Paladee, 48, was the only daughter of Lall Paladee, founder of retailer Pennywise Cosmetics. The murder toll stood at 22 for the year then. Sookhai says the level of crime in the country is horrific, alarming and unacceptable. I think (Government) has to get its act together, they need to get a handle on crime, said Sookhai. He said not only has society been pushed into a fearful state but there are far reaching negative consequences for the economy. Local business will suffer and Trinidad and Tobago will lose international investor confidence. He noted National Security Minister Gary Griffiths recent comments that six out of every ten people murdered in 2013 were involved in serious criminal activities and if a person was not involved in criminal activities there was no need to fear crime. The general public is becoming more and more afraid to lead normal lives. There are a lot of innocent bystanders who get affected when this violence occurs, Sookhai responded. The Chaguanas Chamber is ready and willing to partner in the crime fight and is prepared tomeet with the Governments law enforcement authorities, the Chaguanas Municipal Corporation and the police to develop a crime plan for the borough, and for the country. He said there was a problem with the lack of manpower in the Police Service and facial recognition cameras should be implemented in key areas. This mechanism, he said, was already implemented at the Chaguanas Borough Corporation and if installed along Chaguanas Main Road, Price Plaza and other areas, it would be easier to monitor and build a database of faces and also assist in apprehending criminals. Sookhai pointed out in the United States, these high tech cameras are used and if a person breaks a traffic light or fails to pay road tolls, a ticket is electronically issued to them. Sookhai said Government should also look at reintroducing the use of more police dogs as this could be effective in clamping down the drug and gun trade. Lawlessness, he said, needs to be addressed at all levels, especially on the nations roads. He said one idea in the works was to create more traffic awareness from the Munroe Road flyover to the Chase Village flyover by installing road safety signs and amber lights. Businesses will have the opportunity to give back to the communities by supporting this initiative, he explained. Sookhai lamented that the social fabric of the country was eroded and children were now in danger as they were being abused with few avenues to be saved. He commended the Ministry of Gender, Child and Youth Affairs for its Childline hotline, but said much more was needed to educate children to come out from under the veil of tortured silence. Child abuse is very serious, it is like a virus in this country where a lot of children are being abused. I want to make it a Chamber initiative to partner with the Mayors office to create more awareness in Chaguanas and reach out to children through the schools, the religious institutions and in the communities, said Sookhai. Teachers, he said, spent the most time with children during the day and they too needed to be properly trained and educated on how to pick up the signs of an abused child and lend assistance. Turning to the long-standing idea of transforming Chaguanas into city status, Sookhai expressed disappointment in a recent response he received from Planning MinisterDr Bhoendradatt Tewarie. Tewarie responded to his question saying there was too much anarchy and people were lawless with regard to parking, Sookhai said. Sookhai said transformation starts from the bottom up and it involves changing the mentality of the people through education. We have to fix the way of thinking, it is not an impossible task, said Sookhai. My vision is to start the ball rolling to get improvements in these areas. Once we can do this we can ask the Government again what we can do to better Chaguanas to achieve city status, he said. Chaguanas is in need of proper infrastructure, in particular with respect to its drainage systems. He added that Town and Country Planning officials need to start being more stringent in approvals and in ensuring that building codes and regulations are followed. Sookhai said he welcomed the expansion in the borough but the rules must be followed or the traffic nightmare will increase. He said this is why there must be consultation with respect to the plan of $1.1 billion mega mall project with the planned upgrade of the Centre City Mall located in the heart of the TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

A TTPS media release stated that 2,158 firearms, and 37,000 rounds of assorted ammunition were seized since 2015. From statistics provided in the release, it stated that a total of $109,637,067 in cocaine and marijuana were seized in 2016, while in 2017 thus far $30,727,305 were seized. The release stated: \\u201cOver the comparative period of January to August 2016 and 2017, the TTPS has had notable success in the recovery of illegal arms and ammunition. Whilst it is difficult to measure the quantity of firearms entering the country, the efforts of the TTPS, across the nine policing divisions, with firearm recovery should be noted. Additionally, approximately 37,000 rounds of assorted ammunition have been seized since 2015. The TTPS further seized 691 and 765 firearms for 2015 and 2016 respectively. While 702 firearms have been seized for 2017 thus far. Of the nine divisions, the majority of seizures were made in the Northern, Western and Southern divisions. Of these 2,158 firearms seized for the period overall, the largest categories were that of pistols and revolvers\\u201d. The TTPS said that this was due to the efforts in drug supply reduction by several State agencies. \\u201cWhilst the threat of firearms is real and ever so evident, the effects of the narcotic scourge is equally as devastating and contribute to the loss and diminished quality of life locally The effort in drug supply reduction by local agencies such as Customs and Excise, Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard , security agencies at all ports of entry should not go unnoticed and for this the TTPS commends them for their efforts. These supply reduction efforts, which represent illegal narcotic seizures and eradications, are only one aspect; as the Organised Crime, Narcotics and Firearms Bureau (OCNFB) and other external stakeholders continue to engage in Demand Reduction exercises, such as lectures and displays. These demand reduction exercises are geared toward diminishing the appetite and interest in illegal narcotics, catering to persons of all ages\\u201d, the release stated. The TTPS said there was a number of first time offenders were being held with large quantities of narcotics. \\u201cTo add, these offenders are not limited to unemployed persons seeking financial gain but also professionals, who are otherwise employed in high paying jobs\\u201d, the release said. The Police Service encouraged the public to \\u201cjoin in the fight\\u201d to assist law enforcement agencies in their crackdown efforts. \\u201cThe TTPS and by extension the OCNFB has recognised the continued interest in possessing illegal firearms and narcotics by small groups in society; and as such issues a clarion call for the civic minded nationals to join in the fight.

Only that on this occasion I offer my thoughts for discussion in the public domain. I maintain that the dilemma we face is that we continue to engage in the battle against crime and lawlessness from a premise that is basically flawed. Treating with the alarming spate of crime and lawlessness must of necessity be underpinned with an admission that all individuals are born with the innate nature to be sinful. And sin is lawlessness. Put another way, we are not lawless because we break the law. We break the law, because we are lawless. In much the same way that a knife is not a knife because it cuts. It cuts, because it is a knife. We are not lawyers because we practice law. We practice law, because we are lawyers. And we are not doctors because we practice medicine. We practice medicine, because we are doctors. In other words, the potential of a product to perform an action, whether for good or for evil, is built into the product and is the enabling power or ability that triggers (no pun intended) that action. Within the context of this position which I postulate, it follows that the potential or ability to be lawless or to commit crime is inherently ingrained into our human nature in much the same way that the potential to be lawful and law abiding may be applied. What follows may sound harsh and extremely difficult to come to terms with. It may sound unreal, horrible and almost heretical. But it is a fact of life that we must live with. That fact is that we are not criminals because we commit crime. We commit crime, because we are criminals. All of us are born with the potential, the power, and the ability to engage in criminal activities in much the same way as we are empowered to engage in law abiding activities. No man or woman has escaped that potential. How one cultivates the mindset to manage and control the potential built into the criminal and lawless characteristics of our human nature becomes the overarching dilemma which has plagued civilisations for generations. Man was originally designed to function in such a way that our decisions and actions would have been dictated by the purity of the spirituality which dwells within us. We were designed to function from the inside out rather than from the outside in. In stark contrast, we have allowed the evils of our external environment to contaminate our spirituality, dictate our lives, our lifestyles and our behaviour with the result that we have almost systematically abandoned the original concept with respect to how we were designed to function. We were charged with the responsibility to exercise dominion over the environment but we have instead reversed the role and succumbed to allowing the environment to have dominion over us, lusting, as we do, over what it has to offer and becoming slaves of the evil place which we have shaped the world into being. That we have surrendered and innocently admit to being creatures of this lawless environment rather than take our rightful place as creators of the peaceful and harmonious environment which we all long for has now become our daunting challenge. It now haunts us. In the face of this, we desperately continue to waste billions of dollars, spend excessive time and exert unproductive energy waging war against the effects rather than against the cause. Our efforts are therefore woefully and painfully misdirected. The effects, upon which we misguidingly focus, project themselves in the crime and lawlessness displayed in varying degrees, at all ages and in all social and economic class structures. The cause, which, on the other hand, should really be our primary target, has its genesis in the love of money and sexuality backed by the abominable dimension of greed and standards of behaviour passionately and indiscriminately pursued to satisfy the lust of the flesh. The sad news is that even if we get rid of all the narcotics and all the guns, we would have achieved nothing substantial. There are lots more where they both come from. And, even if we rid them from the face of the earth altogether, they will be disingenuously and speedily replaced by weapons of destruction perhaps of more devastating dimensions. Such is the truth that confronts us. So the trafficking of drugs, narcotics and guns is not the real menace. The menace is an evil force exponentially more clever, more devious and more powerful than meets even our most brilliant intellectual minds. Our Parliamentarians have failed abominably to come to terms with the fact that laws do not by themselves transform or convert souls on their own strength. They must be accompanied with philosophies designed to bring about mindset change. How that better way is written, not in the statute books, but in our hearts, is the real challenge. It requires a deep understanding and appreciation of the conflict of our two natures: the nature of the flesh (forces of evil) battling for supremacy over the nature of the spirit (forces of good). It is the only battlefield within which this relentless war against crime and lawlessness can be meaningfully waged and eventually won. The demand is for a battle of a higher calling. Perhaps the 21st Century Policing, if and when explained to the citizenry, may provide some enlightenment on plans to engage in that battle of a higher calling. I wish them well.

During the two days preceding the Fifth Summit of the Americas, the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (Winad), in conjunction with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), hosted \\\"Women Talking with Women: Crime and Violence in the Caribbean\\\". Participants came up with a regional policy framework for getting women involved in decision-making about violence prevention and exchanged ideas on the role women could play in reducing violence in their households, communities and countries. Winad's Nadine Lewis Agard discussed how Trinidadian women experience gun violence, took us to task on our collective apathy and aired a long laundry list of things to do. Q: We hear about boys and their guns all the time. How did the question of women and the gun culture come up A: Winad was working on an intergenerational programme that addressed violence affecting women, and we realised that it wasn't just domestic violence that came up but also gun violence: what it's like living in communities that are stigmatised, how that affects access to goods, services and jobs and how it affects women and girls, not just as victims but as intimate partners, mothers and children. So, we really became interested in how this surge in gun violence affects women and girls, which is something we don't talk about. Last year, we got funding from UNICEF to go to communities and have conversations with women and girls about violence. We selected the hot spots throughout the country, not just in Morvant and Laventille but also in the West, Central, East and South. Did the women say anything we don't already know We knew we were going to hear a couple things like how much of a fall-out there is when someone dies or goes to jail and what that does to a family and community. What was surprising was the way the issue of domestic violence has really resurged. You have women across the board, female executives for example, living in fear in their own homes. Guns have changed the face of domestic violence. It's no longer a question of women being injured but of them being murdered, and they are scared. We also had conversations with girls who had been through the court system and had been involved in gangs and violent acts. We don't hear from them often. We don't. They opened up about the impact of violence on their lives. They spoke about a ranking system and what you had to do to get highly ranked. At first, it sounded foreign but when you think about it, women in my generation are involved in ranking. It's not violent, but you achieve status by being married to a man with a certain kind of job or car. It's the same with them: a lot of it hinges on their attachment to a man and what kind of man he is. Is he a drug lord How much money does he have How much turf does he control So these women are ranked based either on their connection to a man or their participation in organised, violent acts towards other women. How optimistic are you that women who benefit from men's criminal activity materially, keep their secrets, hide their guns or are fearful, can mobilise into a force that would reduce gun violence I don't think that the women will be transformed suddenly. It won't happen overnight, but it's good to start having the discussions and not see it as an \\\"us and them\\\" kind of thing. Many people will point to \\\"those\\\" women in the same way we talk about \\\"those\\\" men. We always act as if the situation germinated itself. We have to begin asking what we have done and how we have impacted on it. What are the policies of this country and the systems that contribute to violence We have systems that really do allow people to fall through the cracks. Our education system is not perfect. It's about analysing the curriculums and our children. The same programme can't work for everybody. So, how do we tweak our system Several things have gone wrong. There's corruption. The guns are not manufactured in Trinidad. They probably originated legally in the US and came through a stream to T&T, but who is bringing them in We know it's not the grassroots man who doesn't have the money. The country is a small country. We are supposed to be able to monitor our borders and capture people. But the downside of having a small country is that people know people...that kind of corruption is pervasive. The other thing is that there is a type of fallacy that it's all gang violence. When we don't know the nature of the crime, we label it gang violence, and alot of the population is very comfortable hearing that because it means it's not going to reach them: I am not in a gang, we are not in that lifestyle. That feeling permeates law enforcement, the political regime and the public. Collateral damage. Exactly. I've spoken to a support group for women from Laventille who have lost partners and sons to violence, and they complain that whether or not their loved ones had anything to do with drugs or gangs, their deaths were labelled that way. These women don't expect any arrests or convictions. They're resigned to injustice. There is almost a comfort in the rest of the country. This violence has not shaken us as yet because we do not see the boys, lying there in blood, as ours. Somehow, we have not connected that and it has worked against us. We talk about crime and gun violence in this country and see it in terms of poor, young, black youth. When we start to have a holistic look at crime, we begin to understand how crime on a higher level impacts this gun violence we have now. We need to track that and stop that trickle-down. We have to address crimes of the pen. We have to weed out corruption on all levels. How do we drum up the political will and call the authorities to account It is hard, but first we have to understand our responsibility as citizens. How can I call out the politicians and police if as a citizen, I want to fast-track everything, from a driver's licence to passport for my little life What are the next steps We have to put out some statements on what is happening, and how as a region we have not looked at crime and violence. We really have not admitted that this is an overwhelming problem or looked at how it's impacting women and communities...how we are losing opportunities, whether we are part of the violence or not. We have to come up with strategies to get women engaged in crime-stopping and peacemaking and policy-making. That's very much a man's league. We have to ask how we can get women involved in the policy-making to make sure there is a gender perspective and not just one man dead, one man goes to jail, build more jails. There are things we have never addressed. Up to now, we have not had healthy conversations as a nation about slavery, indentureship and the violence of that. We have never spoken collectively about these things, what it meant for us and how it impacted on us. It's reached a stage where we say we don't know how we got here, but ours has always been a violent culture. The way we were spoken to as children was violent. It is just a mishmash of pain and hurt and anger that we have never addressed. We have to start discussions. Let's start talking about our historical pain. That's a vast assignment. How exactly are the groups represented here going to proceed We're having regional sessions looking at United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, the gender perspective of peacemaking and having women more included in policy-making when we talk about security. I think it is important for us to look at regional programming because from what I'm hearing, we have very similar issues. It might be even better for us to do things collectively. But the community conversations are very important too. Every woman has to understand that there are things we can do as women to change not only our families and communities but policies.

Four killings were recorded in as many days, all by gunshot. The amendments to firearms legislation, introduced last Tuesday by National Security Minister John Sandy, are therefore directly on point. Life sentences for third-time gun offenders should at least send a message capable of some deterrent effect. A measure of how much legislation on the books has needed revisiting is the proposed provision to deny gun licences to people with domestic violence convictions. Presumably, such a clause has become necessary because individuals with such records have nevertheless managed legally to own a firearm. Other increased penalties for arms and ammunition possession, transfer, and use are also overdue. Especially so, the exemplary 20-year jail term for people in positions of trust such as police officers, soldiers, and others. Citizens have, indeed, become increasingly concerned about alleged, and confirmed, links between law enforcement officials and criminals. The most telling examples of this are recalled as the arrest of a bandit in 2006, who had in his possession a gun assigned to a still-anonymous police officer from the St James Police Station, and the 2009 discovery of guns and drugs stashed in the ceiling of the St Joseph Police Station. It remains a blot on the image of the police, and really a law-enforcement scandal, that no arrests have been made in either case. As always, however, the toughened laws will be only as effective as the efforts to catch and prosecute offenders. The crime statistics for the past decade do not make for optimistic reading. Between 1999 and 2009, the detection rate for serious crimes dropped from an already dismal 33 per cent to 23 per cent. The figures for the most serious crimes were even worse. The detection of murders dropped from 72 per cent to just 17 per cent, and for wounding from 61 per cent to 42 per cent. Convictions over the same period, meanwhile, dropped by 58 per cent. Detection in narcotics offences declined by 48 per cent, which meant either that such offences had decreased or that the police were catching fewer drug dealers. In light of the continued rhetorical agitation over the drug problem, however, the latter interpretation seems more likely. Legislation alone will thus make no dent on crime. The new laws can be applied only if the criminals are caught and effectively prosecuted. This requires detective work far better than the often hopeless norm, adherence by police officers to proper procedures, and efficient process in the courts. On these aspects of the new crime plan by far the most critical ones the public still awaits promising details.

This is according to Energy Minister Kevin Ramnarine, who said the National Security Council needed to have a coordinated approach to bring an end to the criminality. The Minister said the diesel tanks unearthed in Sea Lots, Port of Spain last week were part of a larger network along the Gulf of Paria coastline and Deputy Commissioner of Police Mervyn Richardson was in charge of investigating it. Ramnarine said he has suggested to National Petroleum (NP) that the disused tanks being stored at Sea Lots, and used to hide the illegal fuel, be destroyed. He also said a dye would be introduced into the fuel in order to track it. Asked if anyone linked to NP was being investigated, Ramnarine said, We are investigating. Two men were arrested but I am yet to find out (under) what law they will be charged. Ramnarine said the Ministry was compiling a list of raids over the past two years which would show the magnitude of the illegal trade. He said the Coast Guard impounded ten vessels during the 2011 State of Emergency which are being kept at Staubles Bay, Chaguaramas. I visited some of those vessels myself and they were retrofitted with several tanks way beyond what was required for the propulsion of the vessel. Ramnarine said through grassroots intelligence the Ministry had been told the diesel trade is actually as lucrative as the drug trade and less risky than the drug trade because the drug trade comes with more severe penalties. So from a risk/reward point of view, we are told there is a migration from the drug trade into the diesel trade, said the Minister. So it is at the core of the criminal underworld in Trinidad and Tobago. It is clearly being used to finance guns. All these guns in the country must be coming from somewhere and somebody must be paying for that. I feel if we tackle diesel in a very significant way, and we have been doing that in the last two years, and perhaps the time has come to turn the screws even harder, we will deal a significant blow to crime.

Sandy delivered a statement at the Parliament sitting yesterday at Tower D of the Waterfront, Port of Spain. Sandy noted that on August 21 a State of Emergency was declared, \\\"following a number of homicides in the wake of a drug bust, intelligence agencies advised on planned massed killings, in which several innocent citizens would have been killed, as had happened days earlier, and was referred to as the beginning of planned random killings. It was as a result of that intelligence report and accompanying information that the State of Emergency was recommended.\\\" The police, based on information at their disposal, arrested several people, a small percentage of whom were held and charged under the Anti-Gang legislation, Sandy said. \\\"Because that legislation was proclaimed mere days before the declaration of the State of Emergency, and because the said legislation could not be enforced retroactively, evidence in the possession of the police, prior to the proclamation of the State of Emergency, could not have been used to charge those arrested,\\\" Sandy said. He said while there were 8,144 arrests during the State of Emergency, \\\"a minor percentage of these were in fact, State of Emergency-related apprehensions\\\". \\\"The recognition is that the 107 days of comparative peace in our nation reflects a resounding success of the State of Emergency. That success manifested itself among other areas, in the realisation by most of our citizens, especially in crime-infested areas, that for the first time in a decade they could reside in their homes peacefully, without worrying about the possibility of falling victim to a stray bullet,\\\" said Sandy. He said the removal of almost $1.5 billion of narcotics from the system was another success as well as the 188 firearms and 13,000-plus rounds of assorted ammunition from the streets. \\\"During the period of the State of Emergency there were 49 murders. We have had instances in the past where more than 49 murders were committed in one month.The State of Emergency also saved the lives of some of our would-be killers, and they must understand that. Our intervention saved their lives and they are still with us today,\\\" said Sandy. With respect to the alleged plot to kill the Prime Minister and Government members, Sandy said Commissioner of Police Dwayne Gibbs had presented an official classified report. \\\"As a consequence, certain persons named in the report and other associates were arrested and detained by the police. One week later detention orders were served in respect of several detainees culminating with 16 men being so detained. Unfortunately, the intelligence gathered by law enforcement authorities could not be converted to admissible evidence and as such, in the interest of justice, the detainees were released. \\\"I wish to state as I did before, that having myself seen the initial report from the police and other subsequent reports, the threat was real and even those who claim scepticism, I am sure in their quiet moments know, and admit to themselves that the threat was real,\\\" said Sandy. Sandy said the 1990 attempted coup could have been averted if the political directorate had listened to law enforcement and acted. \\\"Had we not listened to our law enforcement officials, who continue to have my support, and allowed them to do their jobs, and these threats were carried, this Government would have been accused of not learning from history, and deemed irresponsible,\\\" he said.

The commissioner was addressing members of the media while police officers searched for guns, drugs, ammunition and suspects wanted in connection with murders, shootings, robberies, outstanding warrants and a string of other offences. He said, \\\"We had some good success tonight. We have arrested upwards of 70 people that we've held, and we have also recovered ammunition, some drugs and all done very safely, all done without anybody getting hurt.

Gibbs was briefed by ACP Raymond Craig, head of the Homicide Bureau of Investigations, and Harold Phillip, ACP Anti-Crime Operations, along with acting Supt Lennard Gay, acting ASP Sahadeo Singh and Insp Radcliffe Boxhill. He promised that police would not relent in their effort as they make every attempt to sustain such exercises.

So said Attorney General Anand Ramlogan as he piloted the Administration of Justice Bill in the Senate yesterday. The Attorney General said one of the identifiable factors in the spike in crime had been deportees. \\\"Deportees have contributed in no small measure to the gang-related violence. They have brought with them not only a different culture but an uplift in the criminal enterprise which they learnt from those countries from which they were deported,\\\" he said. He added that all deportees, whether they have been found guilty of a criminal offence or not, would be fingerprinted and would have to give a DNA sample. The Attorney General said sometimes the foreign countries have suspicions but not evidence about a person and they lead them in the direction to being deported. In terms of mandatory testing for law enforcement officers, Ramlogan noted this had generated some concerns but, he said, those involved in enforcing the law must also be subject to the law. \\\"Police officers, coastguardsmen, soldiers, everyone involved in the administration and implementation of the law must give a DNA sample and a fingerprint. He said private security officers would also have to give DNA. Quoting a news report about a police officer charged with human trafficking, Ramlogan said: \\\"We all know, the brothels and the drug blocks, if they sometimes do not have the protection of those who are there to enforce the law, they cannot flourish and prosper in the manner that they do. That is why allowing them to give their fingerprint evidence and submit a DNA sample will help in the fight against crime because if you are part of the problem, you cannot be part of the solution\\\". Citing the case of a young engineer shot to death in Palo Seco as he tried to prevent the kidnapping of his sister, Ramlogan said the ballistic evidence showed the bullet and the gun came from a police station in Arima. \\\"You know what the theory is Police renting out the gun to the gang that went to do the kidnapping. And that is hard, cold chilling facts from real examples. So we make no apologies as a Government for taking a very strong stance. If you want to be an enforcer of the law...give yuh fingerprint, submit your sample and let us get on with it,\\\" he said. He said steps had already been taken up upgrade the Forensic Science Centre, with increases in professional staff. Government was partnering with the UK and US to get technical assistance, he added. He said he had no shame in admitting that the society was playing catch up. He said the Parliament could not take a blind eye to what was taking place on the ground. He cited the case of the three teenagers who hired a taxi driver and threw him over a precipice. \\\"It is time to stop cursing the dark and light a candle,\\\" he said. He said the legislation properly used was bound to revolutionise the criminal justice system. IN THE SENATE AG Ramlogan said the bill might have a multiplier effect, allowing police officers to solve cold cases dating back to 20 years, which was why the bill required DNA samples to be kept for 20 years. The bill also imposes a fine of $100,000 and 20 years jail for anyone who attempts to bribe, intimidate, threaten or injure a judicial officer only because of his/her role in the justice system or any victim of a crime.

The post of National Security Minister not only remained one of the most scrutinised jobs to have in Trinidad and Tobago, but became one of the most difficult positions to hold down in 2013. The country saw three National Security ministers this year. The year 2013 started off with Jack Warner holding the reins of the National Security Ministry. On June 21, 2012, Warner became National Security Minister, replacing Brigadier John Sandy in a Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar. Exactly ten months lateron April 21, 2013Persad-Bissessar announced she had accepted Warners resignation from the position. Warners resignation came amid calls for him to step down as a Government minister following a damning report into his tenure as president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf). That same night, Emmanuel George was named Minister of National Security to replace Warner. George lasted just over four months on the job. On September 6, Gary Griffith was appointed National Security Minister in another Cabinet reshuffle by Persad-Bissessar. Griffith, a former captain in the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, had served as Persad-Bissessars national security adviser since she became prime minister in May 2010. But as the ministers changed, murders continued unabated over the years. In the five years preceding 2013, more than 2,250 lives were lost in Trinidad and Tobago, according to statistics from the Trinidad and Tobago Police Services (TTPS) website. Addressing a Caricom security meeting in Haiti in February, Persad-Bissessar said crime was costing Trinidad and Tobago more than $200 million a year in tourism revenue. In 2013, the Peoples Partnership Government sought to find a legal solution to dealing with the countrys crime scourge. On March 1, legislation to give members of the Defence Force the authority to function and perform the duties of police officers was tabled in Parliament. On March 15, the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2013 was passed with the Governments majority in the House of Representatives. During the debate in the Upper House on the bill, however, Independent senators raised concern about the legislation. The bill required a three-fifths majority, which meant the Government (which has 15 votes) needed to garner the support of at least four Independent senators. With the bill facing defeat, Leader of Government Business Ganga Singh moved to adjourn the debate. The bill was allowed to lapse at the end of the last parliamentary session. The year 2013 also saw claims that an illegal option had been sought to curb the countrys crime scourge: the revival of the Flying Squad. One of the most infamous police commissioners to have ever operated in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1980s was Randolph Burroughs, under whom the clandestine group called the Flying Squad is said to have had the criminal element in this country on the run. In the wake of increasing criminality in Trinidad and Tobago, there is no wonder people have called for the invoking of Burroughss spirit to curb the countrys crime problem. In 2013, claims were made that the covert squad had somehow been resurrected. Former Flying Squad member retired inspector Mervyn Cordner claimed a covert unit called the New Flying Squad Investigation Unit (NFSIU) was operational. Cordner claimed he was given approval by then National Security Minister Jack Warner to set up the unit. Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar told the Parliament there was no direct or applied approval ever given by the National Security Council or the Cabinet for the establishment of the clandestine squad. She referred the matter to acting Police Commissioner Stephen Williams for investigation. The Police Complaints Authority also launched an investigation into the NFSIU and the report is pending. In 2013, Williams said the TTPS was able to achieve phenomenal results in reducing violent crimes in Trinidad and Tobago. Williams said 2013 saw a 33 per cent reduction in violent crimes as compared to 2012. There was also a 21 per cent reduction in fatal accidents between 2013 and 2012, Williams said. This year also saw several successful busts, which were said to have caused a multi-million-dollar dent in the illegal diesel racket. Despite all the successes, however, murders remained a thorn in the side of local law enforcement, with last years total of 379 being surpassed. Following is a list of some of the crimes that occurred across the country in 2013: 1. OFFICER DOWN On February 19, Police Sergeant Hayden Manwaring, 43, was shot in the abdomen after his gun was wrestled away during a fight with a robbery suspect in San Fernando. Manwaring and other officers responded to a report that Moms Diner at Cipero Street, San Fernando, had been robbed. The officers spotted the get away vehicle, a Nissan AD wagon, at Padmore Street, located off the Gulf View Link Road. It was during the apprehension of one of the suspects that Manwarings gun was taken away and he and Constable Nicholas Phillip were shot. Phillip was shot in the arm. On February 20, Manwaring died at San Fernando General Hospital as a result of that injury. Four menKofi Cropper, 40, of Manahambre Road, Ste Madeleine; Kerron Nicholas Garcia, 19, of Aldana Street, Princes Town; Anthony Clement, 37, of East Dry River, Port of Spain; and Kelvin Wallace, 23, of Flamingo Crescent, Pleasantvilleare currently before the San Fernando Magistrates Court, charged with Manwarings murder. Manwaring received a Humming Bird Medal (Bronze) posthumously this year. 2. POLICE KILLING On September 1, Christopher Greaves, a father of two of Fifth Street, Beetham Gardens, was spending time with his son, Isaac, when he decided to go to a shop at the corner of Third Street. At the same time Greaves exited the shop, officers of the Inter-Agency Task Force were conducting a mobile patrol in the area. Greaves took three bullets from behind, one of which killed him, according to an autopsy report dated September 3, 2013, obtained by the Express. And according to a police report, also obtained by the Express, the bullets came from the guns of a police constable and a police corporal who were on mobile patrol on Main Street, Beetham Estate, on September 1. The corporal fired one round from his Galil. The police constable, however, who was driving the police vehicle as well, fired a total of 18 shots, one of which killed Greaves. Greavess death set off tensions in the Beetham community just east of Port of Spain and resulted in a clash between residents and police officers that lasted three days. During that time, police lobbed tear gas canisters and fired their weapons in the air to control enraged residents. Residents blocked the Priority Bus Route and the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway with burning debris, stalling traffic for hours. They hurled missiles at police and vehicles travelling along the highway. Two children who were in passing vehicles were injured and treated at hospital. 3. MALL SHOOTING On August 27, attorney Dr Wesley Debideen was shot dead while eating ice cream as he drove through the Grand Bazaar mall in Valsayn. The shooting took place around 3.45 p.m. According to police reports, while Debideen was driving out of Grand Bazaar, another car suddenly pulled in front of his. Debideen was forced to stop his car. A gunman exited the vehicle which was blocking Debideen and opened fire. Debideen died on the spot. The shooting sent shoppers and employees at the various stores scampering. The gunman returned to his vehicle and drove out of the compound. No one has been charged with this killing. 4. KNIFE ATTACK IN SCHOOL On May 27, 14-year-old Renaldo Dixon, a Third Form pupil of the Waterloo Secondary School in Carapichaima, was fatally stabbed in a knife attack during the schools recess break. Dixon was allegedly attacked by a Fifth Form pupil who allegedly abandoned his Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) history exam. An autopsy performed by pathologist Dr Valery Alexandrov found Dixon suffered a four-inch wound to the lower back, which punctured his left lung. Alexandrov said there were defensive wounds to Dixons arms, indicating he attempted to fight off his attacker. Dixon was pronounced dead at the Freeport Health Centre. A Fifth Form pupil of the Waterloo Secondary School is currently before the Couva Magistrates Court, charged with Dixons death. 5. FAMILY KILLED On July 18, cattle farmer Berricou Subhan, 46, and two of his children were stabbed to death at their home at Ackbar Trace, South Oropouche, by Silvan Alladin, who was shot and killed by police while he was in the act of stabbing a third child. Subhans daughter Sherifa, 14, and fiveyear- old son, Musa, were killed during the incident. Subhans wife, Rasheeda Alladin, 33, sustained multiple stab wounds to her neck. The couples nine-year-old daughter, Laylaa, was cut several times on her chest. The only person to escape injury was seven-year-old Saleen. Alladin was a 38-year-old drug addict with a criminal history. He was the cousin of Rasheeda Alladin, and was raised by Subhans mother. 6. HIGHWAY HEIST On November 27, a Sentinel Security Services van was robbed of millions in cash destined for Tobago for all of the islands major commercial banks. Veteran Sentinel Security guard Asst Estate Supt Bert Clarke, 59, was murdered in the robbery. The driver who survived the robbery was questioned by detectives. Investigators have observed the sophisticated nature and clinical planning of the heist. Speaking at Clarkes funeral, general manager of Sentinel Security Services, Edgar Hackett said Clarke sacrificed his life to save the driver of the security van. Hackett said according to the report he received on the incident, when there was an impact on the cash-in-transit vehicle, Clarke exited the van. Hackett said Clarke did so to see if everything was all right with the occupants of the other vehicle. Then Clarke saw four individuals with sophisticated weaponry running toward him. Clarke re-entered the security van. Over 50 rounds of ammunition were fired, Hackett said. While inside the vehicle one of the gunmen approached the driver and placed a gun to his head, Hackett said. Bert threw himself on the driver and in the process was shot in the head, Hackett said. No one has been charged. 7. KEYANA KILLED On November 28, six-year-old Keyana Cumberbatch was found stuffed inside a barrel inside her familys Building Four, Maloney Gardens, apartment. This gruesome discovery ended a four-day search for Cumberbatch. On November 25, Cumberbatchs mother, Simone Williams, reported her missing. Cumberbatch was a pupil of the nearby St Barbaras Shouter Baptist Primary School. Cumberbatchs stepfather, Dwayne Lewis, 28, is currently before the Arima Magistrates Court, charged with the murder of the girl. Lewis spent a few days at Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex in Mt Hope following his arrest, battling asthma. On December 16, Lewis appeared before Senior Magistrate Indrani Cedeno and has been ordered to be sent to the St Anns Hospital for a 14-day assessment. He is to reappear in court next Monday. 8. BAR SHOOTING On December 22, Lance Corporal Rawle Fletcher, a defender with the Defence Force Football Club, businessman Mitra Maharaj and teenaged student Anil Diram were all killed in a drive-by shooting outside a bar in Preysal, Couva. Fletcher, 34, was shot multiple times in the head, while his best friend, businessman Mitra Maharaj, was hit about the body. Diram, a 19-year-old National Energy Skills Centre (NESC) student, was shot in the chest. Police said Fletcher, of Polo Grounds Road, Preysal, was liming with Maharaj, of Orchard Gardens, Chaguanas, outside Sandy Annan Bar, near Inshan Ali Park in Preysal, when they were killed around 3.25 a.m. Diram, of Gran Couva, was walking to his friends car outside the bar when he was hit by a bullet. He was part of an all fours tournament taking place at the bar. Police said Fletcher and Maharaj were standing between two cars in the parking lot when a man walked up to them. He looked at Fletcher and smiled before returning to his vehicle. Investigators said the car moved forward and then reversed, before the occupants opened fire on the men. Patrons at the bar began running to safety, but Diram was caught in the gunfire. Police said a back seat passenger walked out of the car, stood over Fletcher and Maharaj and shot them multiple times.

The officers are among the 40 police officers transferred from the St Joseph station following Saturday's find of drugs, a cache of seven guns and a large quantity of ammunition in the ceiling of the St Joseph Police Station. Following the seizure, acting Commissioner of Police James Philbert ordered a full scale investigation be launched and mandated ASP John Martinez to carry out enquiries. The illegal items were found in an office used by several police officers. One of the affected officer, a police sergeant, proceeded on two weeks vacation leave yesterday. Other officers who were transferred have voiced their intention to do likewise or proceed on sick leave since they claim they are innocent of any wrongdoing. Since the find became public there have been statements by the Chamber of Commerce and other organisations calling on Philbert to launch a full scale investigation and remove the rogue elements from the Police Service. Philbert is expected to address the media today on the status of investigations into the matter. All items confiscated have been taken for forensic testing for fingerprints or if there are clues as to the person (s) responsible for the concealment of the items.

Several repentant gang members had surrendered, he said, and the Police Service would welcome more converts. Witnesses, he said, would be able to give evidence in secret, according to the legislation the police had suggested to Government. Philbert said only recently, three former gang members had \\\"made their guns available to the police and turned their back, saying they were done. They are finished with this life\\\". Philbert said last Sunday, he met some 20 former criminals in Port of Spain, men who had aligned themselves with a church. He said follow-up meetings were planned to help the men follow the path of the law-abiding. Philbert's media statement was meant to inform citizens of more measures to fight violence of historic proportions affecting the country. Yesterday's murder count was 441, not counting the missing and presumed killed, and unidentified murder victims in morgues across the country. Special Anti-Crime Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (SAUTT) stated last night: \\\"We are aware of the ongoing engagement between the TTPS and gang members, who have expressed the desire to leave their life of crime, as this has been discussed at head of security meetings.\\\" Two weeks ago, Minister in the Ministry of National Security Donna Cox said there were 81 gangs operating in the country, five fewer than the figure given by her senior, Martin Joseph, in January. Joseph's figures suggested there were potentially 1,720 gang members, up significantly from the 500 in the 66 gangs he spoke about three years ago. Many of the murders this year have been linked to drug, guns and turf wars, and revenge killings between gangs. Said Philbert yesterday: \\\"In the past months, several members of gangs have surrendered to the police, asking for help to take them out of a life of crime.\\\" Philbert said the recent murders and sex attacks on tourists in Tobago and Antigua were inspired by economic activity \\\"which brings financial gains to them\\\".

Maguire who led a large scale research project in Trinidad and Tobago from 2004 to 2010 focusing on gangs, violence and the capacity of the nation's government to address these issues was at the time speaking via video message at the recent Dana Saroop Seetahal Symposium: Re-engineering the Criminal Justice System at the UWI, St Augustine, when he made the statement. \\\"During our time in Trinidad and Tobago my team and I carried out a number of different studies on crime, violence and policing, one of the things that we found is that there was a significant lack of protective mechanisms to offset the risk factors that kids face in Trinidad and Tobago,\\\" he said. Maguire said a framework that focuses on three things: prevention, intervention and suppression needs to be used in addressing the problem in this country. \\\"Prevention efforts are those that seek to keep kids out of gangs or away from crime in the first place, intervention efforts are those that focus on kids that are already in gangs trying to get them either to leave the gang or to reduce the severity of the behaviour. \\\"Suppression efforts involve the use of the criminal justice system including police, courts, prosecution, incarceration and so forth to try to reduce gang related offenders,\\\" he said. Linking the framework to the issue of addressing gang violence Maguire asked, \\\"In the area of prevention does the nation have in place appropriate mechanisms to protect kids from the various factors that they are facing and to help make them more resilient in the face of these risks so that they don't join gangs or commit crime in the first place With regard to intervention: does the nation have appropriate mechanisms to help pull kids away from gangs or to help them reduce the severity of their behaviour while they are in gangs, so that they are not committing acts of violence And with regards to suppression: does the nation have in place all the appropriate agreements and partnerships necessary to ensure that the crime lab is working effectively with the police that the police are working effectively with prosecutors Also that we can ensure that we can identify, arrest, prosecute and imprison the nation's most serious repeat offenders who are responsible for committing multiple acts of violence\\\" During his presentation Maguire also noted that the 2004-2010 research also found that drugs was not the main cause of most homicides in this country but guns were the real problem behind the violence. \\\"One of the things I hear regularly is the view that people kill each other in Trinidad and Tobago because of drugs.

Thats two killings, every three days, for 20 years. To stop them, the PM and AG now offer the Miscellaneous (Defence and Police Complaints) Bill, 2013. They wish to follow Jamaica, Guyana, and Antigua and Barbuda, but provide no comparative data. That is not surprising. This amendment has its purpose, but experience shows that reducing crime is not one. On that night in mid-August 1993, we were horrified by Mikes murder in circumstances which are now normal. Our Commissioner of Prisons at the time, when Mike was attacked for his car while dropping bread off to a charity, he killed one; the other still waits on death row. Around Mikes murder, it was coincidental that convicted killers Michael Bullock and Irvine Phillip were scheduled to hang. At Mikes funeral procession, signs read Hang Them High. They were never. Since then, illegal firearms were used in most killings, and many involved young men, like Mikes killers. Numerous resources have been devoted to studying these senseless killings, the proliferation of illegal firearms, and the extensive work needed to reduce both of them. Still, in Jamaica, Guyana, and Antigua and Barbuda, like Trinidad and Tobago, crime and the public perception of insecurity continues to increase, not decline. In 1994, Jamaica authorised its PM to use the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) for the purpose of maintaining and securing public safety and public order. 16-years later, the potency of desperate politicians and military might went on display, as joint police-JDF operations were used to capture and extradite reputed drug lord Christopher Dudus Coke. In a piece titled, The massacre in Jamaica, The New Yorker noted that in pursuit of Dudus, no fewer than 74 people were killed. After the 1994 amendment to its Defence Act, Jamaicas murder rate actually more than doubled, from 24 per 100,000 to over 59 per 100,000 in 2007. 16-years after the amendment, homicides finally declined in 2010 and 2011, on the basis of improved police operations. Antigua and Barbuda hit its highest number of murders one year after the 2007 legislative amendment. An Antigua Observer report in January 2013 pointed to widespread perception that criminal activity was on the rise in 2012. And, in February 2013, just as our debate on this amendment was heating up, Antigua and Barbudas PM Baldwin Spencer said in the wake of another murder, we have over the past few years been invaded by events of crime and violence that are alien to this part of the world. Over the past few months, we have seen a shocking and callous wave of crime and violence involving the use of illegal firearms. PM Spencer suggested as a solution that all the necessary legal processes needed to give effect to the death penalty, which is still part of the Laws of Antigua and Barbuda, will be utilised. Like Trinidad and Tobago after the Hercules and other murders, the death penalty is always a factor, but never a feature. In Guyana, the Guyana Defence Force (GDF) has a controversial history, with serious allegations of crime and election fraud. But, a policing role for the GDF is not something the current Commodore of the GDF Gary Best supports. Like former Partnership Minister of National Security John Sandy, Commodore Best believes that soldiers do not have a policing function, but a supporting role that, requires them only to provide a safe environment in which the police are to carry out their functions. A current UK travel advisory on Guyana warns that crime levels are high and police capacity is low. There are regular armed and violent robberies against businesses and individuals. There is a risk of passers-by being caught up in such incidentsthe Police tend to respond with firearms if shot at or threatened. There were 512 robberies under arms during the period January to October 2012 (a 15 per cent increase from 2011). And in the same period 114 murders took place (in a country with a population of just over 750,000). Experience from Jamaica, Guyana, and Antigua and Barbuda does not suggest a correlation between this amendment and crime reduction. The Partnerships next justification is as unsustainable. Theres value in the argument that the law on joint defence force-police operations needs to be unambiguous, but sunset legislation does not provide a permanent solution for what the Government sees as an ongoing concern. Having made the case for clearer powers and immunities, theres no reason why the legislative changes should die in 2015. If the Partnership honestly believes that this amendment is needed in 2013, then it can be sure that the amendment will still be needed in 2015. The Partnership has shown that joint operations have been used since the 1970s when crime was much lower, so why would they not be required after 2015 The PM says, We believe that giving soldiers the powers, privileges, immunities as are given by law to members of the police service and others can potentially have a positive impact on the reduction of crime. Does she also believe that in 2015, by some magic, the military will no longer require these powers, privileges, immunities There is no doubt that the Partnership Government is at its wits end in the fight against crime. It made the biggest dent in the murder rate during the State of Emergency, but its use of emergency powers failed miserably against perceived gang members. Jamaica, Guyana, and Antigua and Barbuda are no better off than this country, and while the current amendment may be a nice to have, it is no need to have. The public requires something more and soon. Twenty years since two youths felled our beloved Mike Hercules, senselessness still characterises most killings. To counter the trend, we could do without senselessness from our politicians.

Welcoming the opportunity for discussion created by Minister of Works and Transport Jack Warner's suggestion to bring back hanging to deter crime, the CCSJ in a release said that it has found no conclusive proof that the death penalty is a deterrent that reduces crime rates. In a media statement issued earlier this week, the CCSJ said that hanging will not improve the low level of crime detection, arrests and convictions, and it will not address the long delays in having cases dealt with expeditiously by the courts. As such the CCSJ recommended that the government improve the administration of justice and the ability of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service to fight crime. Instead of baying for blood the CCSJ suggested that the government develop a holistic approach to address the root causes of crime and violence, such as, social exclusion which includes poverty; the breakdown of family life; the proliferation of illegal drugs and guns; and the prevalence of gang culture in Trinidad and Tobago. Other root causes listed were illiteracy and an inadequate education system; unemployment and underemployment; high crime environs; poor health; inadequate housing; and lack of basic amenities. The CCSJ also recommended that the government improve the archaic prison system and embrace models of restorative justice that address crime in terms of the harm done to victims and communities and not simply as a violation of the law. Calling for no stone to be left unturned in addressing white collar crime and corruption, the CCSJ asked, \\\"How many 'big boys,' those who are bringing in the drugs and guns, do we see in our prisons\\\" The CCSJ said it recognises that those who are found guilty of murder must be held accountable for their crimes. The commission quoted the late Pope John Paul II as saying in 1995 that the Catholic Church views capital punishment as undermining the sacredness of life and only serves to inflame the culture of violence that is already prevalent in society.

Unfortunately, I have to disagree with our minister. This culture of entitlement where people are of the opinion that they are entitled to money they never worked for or a job they aren't qualified for is the worst thing that could ever happen to our nation state. The core national values of industry, innovation and entrepreneurship that birthed great nations like America, South Korea, Japan and Germany are defenestrated and replaced by a culture of indolence, drinking, partying, poor work ethics, and a general attitude to one's fellow man that is short-fused, \\u201cbrutish and nasty\\u201d. There are thousands of young people in this country with university degrees, who will never land a job, not because there aren't any, but because they don't have a 'link'. This vicious cycle inadvertently produces a sub-culture of crime where the young men and women turn to drugs, guns and violence in order to \\u201ceat ah food\\u201d since they have no inside connections Against the background of all of the above, I now submit that unless we start paying more attention to \\u201cdetoxifying\\u201d our culture, concentrating more on inculcating useful values, ethics, and principles of integrity in the media and the arts, our schools, our homes, and churches, no reform of our laws, no empowering of the police with more up-to-date equipment and resources, and no increase of allocations to the Ministry of National Security will help stem the tsunami of white-collar and vicious crimes that is now drowning our nation.

Speaking on the Bail (Amendment) Bill, 2013 at the Senate sitting, Griffith appealed to senators to note the oath they took when entering office\\u2014to bear true faith and allegiance to Trinidad and Tobago and lend their support to the bill. He said the argument was put forward about the perception of a person's constitutional rights being infringed through this legislation. However, he said if someone is arrested tomorrow for being in possession of $640 million in cocaine, the current law gives that person a constitutional right to bail. \\\"What we are setting ourselves up for is a blood bath,\\\" said Griffith, adding that when such a person is allowed bail and returns to freedom, there is continued damage to the youth of the country and for the gun and drug trade to continue. He said without the bill, the criminal goes free on bail and can also launch an attack on the very police officers or \\\"put a hit\\\" on individuals who assisted in his arrest. The bill, said Griffith, will aid in dismantling gangs in this country. He noted that last year, 247 murders out of 405 were related to gun and drug activities. Griffith said legislation will ensure there is that protection for people wanting to pull away from a life of crime. He said the Anti-Gang Act does not have any provisions with respect to the denial of bail and therefore the Bail Amendment Bill was needed in the crime fight, as preventing someone from leaving a gang, recruiting gang members and possession of an illegal firearm would be non-bailable offences. The Bail Bill, he added, will boost citizens' confidence and encourage them to provide information to the police. Griffith said there has been a decline in the detection rate over the years and this was because of the lack of human intelligence and the need for proper crime scene investigations. The bill, he said, will give the people of this country an opportunity to exhale and have confidence in law enforcement. He said further that people who are victims of rape and sexual offences will also have the will to come forward and ensure the perpetrator is jailed. As it stands now, he said, a person who rapes someone can be granted bail and then go back into the communities and confront their victims. Griffith added that a person can be held with a M16 weapon, which can kill more than 30 people at one time, and be allowed to \\\"get out of jail\\\" with bail. The minister urged senators to stop thinking about the rights of the criminals and start thinking about the 1.3 million law-abiding citizens in this country who need the protection offered under the Bail Amendment Bill.

Moreover, there is also worry about T&T being a viable transit point for drugs, arms and ammunition. Although this is cause for alarm, the CoP is seeking to trivalise the dilemma by drawing attention to T&T's location making us a natural transit point. Trends however suggest other factors that sugar-coat T&T in the eyes of the underworld. The breathalyser test and the outlawing of cellphone use, without a hands-free device while driving, were necessary and welcome elements in minimising traffic offences and associated fatalities. As with many other aspects, these initiatives began \\\"hot and sweaty\\\" and have since waned to the point of near non-existence. Every day I see people driving around with one hand pressing a cellphone to an ear, in some cases within mere feet of police officers. Anyone can tell you that for Carnival 2012, it was business as usual in that drunk people were getting behind steering wheels in droves after fetes. These folks were not bothered as they knew that the breathalyser would be \\\"on vacation\\\" for the season. Indeed, law enforcement in this country is a one-day or seasonal affair. The murder rate, cited as the biggest problem in T&T and an insuperable challenge for more than one government, continues to spiral out of control. Meanwhile, the Government and Opposition play \\\"footsie\\\" with the \\\"hanging bill\\\", conveying to criminals at home and abroad that T&T is not serious about solving/reducing crime. Some argue that the real issue for our leaders is about staying in power or taking power from those who govern. So caring for the people goes as far as securing votes when that time comes. In highlighting T&T's allure to drug traffickers and terrorists, the report described our shoreline defence as porousa logical conclusion when we envision the number of guns in criminal hands. Clearly, the periodic purchasing of surveillance equipment, a couple of speed boats and helicopters is not cutting it. So more must be done to block the waves of crime that currently bash our shores, pervade the land and oppress our people. More must be done in the area of law enforcement, from traffic violations to murder, from petty theft to CEOs in white-collar crime. More must be done to build public trust and confidence in law enforcers, which will procure more information and improve crime resolution rates. Sooner than later T&T must show that it can competently manage its affairs, lest we become engulfed by the evils that lurk beyond our shores.

Mexico won 4-2. \\u0097Photo: AFP Crooked politicians and organised criminals can be stopped if the law hits them where it hurts the most\\u2014in their pockets. Attorney David West, an expert in the field of extradition and money-laundering laws, believes a single piece of legislation can make a significant dent in the pockets of drug and gun dealers and can also put the brakes on politicians, who often seek to hide their ill-gotten gains in the names of relatives and friends. West is urging the Government, if it is serious about fighting crime, to introduce a piece of legislation called the \\\"Civil Assets Forfeiture\\\", which is a form of confiscation of assets by the State. Speaking with the Sunday Express at his office, at El Dorado Chambers, St Vincent Street, Port of Spain last week, West explained that the Proceeds of Crime Act is limited and should be amended by a simple majority to allow for the seizure of illegal assets even if a \\\"suspect\\\" has not been convicted of a criminal offence. \\\"We have in Trinidad and Tobago the Proceeds of Crime Act, which allows for the confiscation or seizure of assets by the State, once a person has a conviction. But with this new law, once you have cause to suspect that somebody has assets or property illegally got, you can seize it, through a disclosure order which you can apply for through the courts,\\\" he said. \\\"This applies not only to gang lords, but politicians, or whoever you may suspect of having questionable properties or assets. The beauty about this is that it is a civil proceeding, so the State brings proceedings against the property rather than against the individual,\\\" West explained. He said Caribbean neighbours Jamaica, St Vincent, Dominica, Antigua/Barbuda, as well as international partners Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America already have such legislation in place. Barbados' Cabinet is currently looking at taking such legislation to the Parliament, said West. In May 2013, Dominica amended its laws to allow authorities the power to use civil forfeiture of assets, which was applauded by US Ambassador to that island, Larry Palmer, for being the first country in the Eastern Caribbean to pass civil asset laws. \\\"It does not need a constitutional majority because it is against property and not against persons,\\\" West explained, adding that \\\"the Financial Action Task Force, (FATF) in its 40 recommendations, passed on February 12, 2012, recommended that countries consider adopting measures that allow such proceeds or instrumentalities to be confiscated without requiring a criminal conviction\\\". According to West, \\\"This law is necessary because what it does is to ensure that the ill-gotten money is not used to facilitate gang violence and white colour crime in Trinidad. What happens is that the criminals buy weapons, vehicles, etc, so what this law does, it allows the police or DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions) to see that some individuals have assets that are not conforming with their financial abilities or financial profiles and, based on that, you obtain an order from the courts to confiscate the assets.\\\" West conceded that the legal system was challenged with lengthy delays and what obtains currently is the police must wait until a person is convicted (which could take years) before being able to confiscate any assets. \\\"So this is a quick, efficient and effective method to seize somebody's assets to take them out of the system and attack their proceeds of crime. If Government is serious about fighting crime, this is the best method in the short term for them to arrest the crime situation. I have personally spoken with the Minister of National Security Gary Griffith about this and he is in favour of this type of legislation being brought before Parliament. This is an excellent method of taking away the assets from gangs.\\\" West said there is no doubt that organised crime was thriving in this country. \\\"The movement of drugs and quantity of drugs being located in T&T is not by any one person but organised group of persons controlling a drug system. That's why we have (US) Drug Enforcement Agents (DEA) in Trinidad, they are not here because they want a holiday but because they are trying to prevent that activity reaching the US.\\\" West concurred: \\\"Any government that does not implement or bring to Parliament this bit of legislation is not serious about fighting crime in Trinidad.\\\" He added that the movement of money out of the country and the questionable purchasing of properties would be covered under this legislation. \\\"It will be a complete tightening...and as I explained it is under the civil system, so it would be a quicker method to dealing with crime. Without it we would be swimming against the tide. With this piece of legislation, it is a different ball game. Not only that, but this is also self-sustaining, in that the assets seized can be used in the very same fight against crime. Vehicles, money, property\\u2014all of that can be used to fight crime.\\\" West, former interim head of the Financial Intelligence Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (FIUTT) and ex-head of the Central Authority for Extradition and Mutual Assistance in the Office of the Attorney General, believes this legislation will make it difficult for corrupt persons or criminals to hide.

Volney, who spoke with the Express via telephone yesterday, said he believed that the measure is not reasonably justifiable and was just a reaction to crime that came out of desperation. Speaking at the post-Cabinet media briefing on Thursday Ramlogan announced that a number of laws are to be amended to deal with the crime scourge. Among them are the Bail Act; the Act to provide for the Death Penalty and the Jury Act. He said those who have been arrested, charged and convicted of gun crimes, gang crimes and violent crimes within the last ten years and are charged again would be denied bail. They can be held for 120 days without bail. Regarding the Bail Act the AG said the three strikes and two strikes rule with respect to the denial of bail had not proven to be as effective as one would have liked. He said by the time police get from one conviction to another, so that the denial of bail can be triggered, it is often too late as many innocent citizens may become the victim of crimes by these persons. Currently a person convicted on three previous occasions for certain offences such as using an imitation firearm in the pursuit of an offence, arson, receiving stolen goods, larceny of the motor vehicle and perverting or defeating the cause of justice, is denied bail for a fourth offence. Persons who are convicted of other offences, such as manslaughter, robbery, possession and use of a firearm without licence, trafficking in dangerous drugs, incest, kidnapping, kidnapping for ransom, are denied bail after two strikes. The bail bill would require a 3/5 majority. Ramlogan said he would be sending to the Opposition a draft bill as part of the package of proposals Government had put on the table as it seeks consensus in the legislative agenda to address crime. Volney said if he was still in Parliament he would not support the bill and called on the opposition not to either. He said given the perception of corruption in the police service the bill if it became law could be used as oppress citizens adding that early and decisive trials would be better.

Speaking with the Sunday Express last Tuesday, Ministry of National Security officials said talks are taking place with stakeholders and thus far, there has been a positive response toward the reintroduction of the unit. Statistics obtained from the Crime and Problem Analysis unit (CAPA) indicate that the Organised Crime Narcotics and Firearms Bureau (OCNFB) have seized in excess of $200 million in narcotics from January 2010-September 30, 2016. The illegal drugs seized include marijuana, cocaine and heroin. Officers of the T&T Police Service (Task Force, Criminal Investigation Department etc) collectively hauled 264 kg cocaine and 1,755 kg marijuana for the year thus far, according to CAPA. Spokesperson for the T&T Coast Guard Lt Sherron Manswell told the Sunday Express on Friday that for the year so far, 204 interceptions have taken place, resulting in more than $59 million in marijuana being seized. Last year, Manswell said, there were 195 interceptions resulting in over $18 million in marijuana being seized. Cocaine was also confiscated, weighing 100 kilogammes. Sources say once the PSMB is functional, it is expected that a dent in the flow of drugs through T&T's borders will be made. Areas such as Los Iros, Las Cuevas and even through the Oropouche and Caroni swamps have been identified as routes for drug shipments, sources say. Drugs enter the country most times undetected and \\u201cour borders are left naked to these criminal elements\\u201d, they added. Sources say that the unit will fall under the OCNFB and will also see the National Security Ministry commissioning vessels for officers to conduct costal patrols. Speaking with the Sunday Express on Friday, acting Commissioner of Police Harold Phillip confirmed talks about re-establishing the unit \\u201care in the initial stage and it is part of this Government's policy to secure the borders. We have spoken about it, and as I mentioned before, we are still at the initial stage.\\u201d South-Western Division highest drug find In 2013, the Southern Division accounted for the highest narcotics seizures. Its tally was 115, with Northern Division second at 99. In 2014, Southern again accounted for the highest seizures with 73, and Northern with 72 seizures. In 2015 and 2016, Northern and Eastern held the highest seizure rates respectfully. In 2013, there were 475 seizures in T&T, in 2014 there was a drop resulting in 439, 2015-453 and for 2016 (January-September) 247. Central saw an increase in drug seizures in 2015, whereit accounted for 51, This was an increase from 2013 and 2014 respectively, at 29 and 43. Several of these seizures were made at the private residences of citizens, during road block exercises or tips left by members of the public, which led to officers to abandoned structures. Marine Branch launch failed The original Police Marine Branch was disbanded in June 1989, under the then-National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR). Assets of the branch were consolidated with the Coast Guard as an efficiency measure. Under then-acting commissioner of police James Philbert in 2009, two interceptor vessels were handed over to the police for use by officers of what was supposed to be the revamped Police Marine Branch. The vessels were painted in the T&T Police Service blue and white symbol and also had the TTPS logo. Sources say officers of the Coast Guard were given the responsibility of training the police officers but this was never done and the two interceptors were given to the Coast Guard. Bring back the Marine Branch Unit Criminologist Prof Ramesh Deosaran said any decision to have the unit brought back was a step in the right direction. Speaking with the Sunday Express on Friday, Deosaran said: \\u201cThe Marine Branch of the Police Service should not have been terminated in the first place. \\u201cWe had the appropriate manpower and though we needed more vessels, that could have been easily remedied. But with the closure of the unit, it left a big space for too large a time and in that gap a lot of ugly things happened in the Gulf of Paria and from South America, moreso, that body on the western coast of T&T. \\u201cSecondly, the Marine Branch as welcome as it is, cannot be left alone without proper aerial support. It must be accompanied by a helicopter version of surveillance, because the boats cannot move quickly, given some of the speed boats available with the illegal shipment of drugs and human trafficking and illegal shipment of guns.\\u201d Deosaran said an \\u201call-round system and the radar system should also be introduced aggressively now. \\u201cYou don't do these things by the step by step strategy anymore, it has to be an all-rounded systematic intervention, because things are getting from bad to worse in respect to the illegal shipment of guns, arms, drugs and human trafficking. \\u201cCoastal surveillance is critical for a long time and I think they should bring it back.\\u201d Monos Island Bust: Investigation incomplete On August 25, 2005, law enforcement agencies made the country's biggest drug haul, netting $700 million in cocaine. Venezuelans Darwin Gonzales, Alonzo Valera, Cesar Perrera and Freddie Garcia, along with Trinidadians Shaheed Ali and Victor Sylvester were charged with various offences including possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, arms and ammunition. In May, 2008, the accused were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. They have since appealed the ruling and are awaiting a date for hearing. Then-High Court judge Alice Yorke Soo-Hon during her sentencing in May 2008 of the men had questioned why the main house at Passy Bay, Monos Island (where the drugs were seized), was not searched. The cocaine, weighing 1,749 kilogrammes, along with seven firearms-two rifles, three pistols, one revolver, one sub-machine gun and 247 rounds of assorted ammunition\\u2014were found in the caretaker's cabin, adjacent to the main house. Yorke Soo-Hon had said she was puzzled as to why the owners of the house \\u201cnever appeared to be interviewed\\u201d by the police and \\u201cwhy the ownership of the drugs was never ascertained\\u201d. Apart from those questions, Yorke Soo-Hon noted: \\u201cInvestigations fell short and it was astonishing to note that the main house at Passy Bay was not searched...\\u201d She also expressed shock at the \\u201clittle or no surveillance\\u201d of the country's coastline. Speaking with the Sunday Express on Thursday afternoon, a former detective who probed the Monos Island bust said officers never bothered to \\u201cfollow up\\u201d or further probe the matter, \\u201csince there was nothing else to go on\\u201d. \\u201cThose caught were not saying anything and we reached a dead end,\\u201d the former officer said.

Officers from the Cunupia CID and Charge Room, acting on information and surveillance activity, raided the apartment at Matna Road, Endeavour, Chaguanas shortly around 5 p.m. when they found the illegal items. The exercise, which was coordinated by ACP Terry Young, head of the Central, South and South-Western Divisions, was supervised by Snr Supt Deodath Dulalchan, head of the Central Division and led by Supt Johnny Abraham. Police said they also found two bank note counters, electronic devices used to accurately check large quantities of cash, and an electronic scale, believed to be used in weighing the illegal drugs. The drugs, believed to be from St Vincent, commonly called \\\"Vincy press\\\", were found wrapped in plastic inside a large blue cooler inside the apartment. It has an estimated street value of more than $60,000, police said. In the same room, police found 700 rounds of 9mm ammunition in 14 crates also wrapped in plastic. Each of the crates contained 50 rounds of ammunition, police said. A computer, which is believed to have valuable drug, gun and ammunition sales transactions stored on its hard drive, was also seized by Cunupia police. Police believe the suspect may have handled hundreds of thousands of dollars and is also involved in the sales of guns and other contraband. He is also wanted on money laundering charges. Among the officers who raided the apartment and recovered the items were Sgt Dhanie, WPC Gomez and PCs Phillip, Ramsaran, Boxhill and Jaikaran of the Cunupia Police Station. The man, police said, had been occupying the premises since October 2010, paying a monthly rent of $4,000. The suspect, police said, usually paid the rent on time but is not listed as the tenant to whom the apartment was leased. The owner of the apartment was interviewed by police. Officers said they have recognised that drug and gun runners have adopted a strategy of renting expensive apartments in upscale communities which are used as storage facilities for illegal contraband. The apartment where the items were found, police said, was outfitted with expensive furniture and electronics and electrical appliances. WPC Gomez is continuing investigations into the incident. ACP Young, Snr Supt Dulalchan and Supt Abraham commended the officers for their diligent work in recovering the items. Young and Dulalchan only recently took up duties in their respective positions. \\\"We have already rolled out our anti-crime plan for Carnival and criminals or persons who wish to come to the Central Division to commit offences or use as an escape route, are being warned that they will be caught and made to feel the full brunt of the law,\\\" Supt Abraham told the Express following the seizure of the items.

An ordinary looking man with kind, intelligent eyes, he is an attentive father, quiet and calm, with an engaging smile. He runs his 'business' like a pro, organising shipments and distribution as well as any UWI management graduate. His home is clean and neat, the walls adorned with paintings and pictures from the Bible. He is a man who could be a councillor or MP for his area, given the concern he has for the people of his community. But that's not how life works - the ones who get into office, and become instruments of the 'system', quickly get used to the perks and the power, leaving the drug dealers to take care of the communities. Everybody wants to live nice. For some there are legitimate ways and means of doing so; others commit white-collar crimes and get away with it; while the bandits, gangsters, thugs, call them what you want, see the system as unjust and corrupt, and decide to play the game - their way. Crime is happening all over the world, in every country, on different levels. But the violence and brutality we are experiencing in Trinidad and Tobago right now is unprecedented in our short history as an independent state. We all know the different factors at play: guns and drugs coming from South America, open borders, billions of dollars flowing through the economy, corrupt officials and an ineffective police force. Add to this an uneducated, angry legion of men, both young and old, with no hope but plenty of ambition and the desire to be somebody, by any means necessary. In this crisis of hopelessness, finding one who would speak frankly and fearlessly about this way of life is a difficult task. The number one rule of the ghetto is to keep one's mouth shut. As they say in Jamaica, and as many have learnt the hard way in T&T, 'informer fi dead'. But those who live on the wrong side of the law in this country have another reason to keep quiet: they say the police are involved in the crime. This is Dean's claim. He agreed to speak to me only on condition of complete anonymity; if he could be identified in any way, he could certainly kiss his life, and even that of his family, goodbye. Dean was cagey, he chose his words with care. He related incidents that implicated police officers in the running of drug blocks and the importing of guns...deadly information. We present some of this information. Q: How long have you had your business About 10, 15 years. Q: Why did you choose to be what upstanding members of the society would call a criminal I doh want to do this, yuh know. But I living third and fourth lives because of what de police do me. So I reach a point now where I doh care and I just living. Q: How much (drugs) do you sell in, say, a week [Shakes his head] I cyah tell yuh dat. Dah's my personal business.

Q: What would you do if weed was legalised I could do business, like run a store or something, some kind of business. If they legalise it, I stop right away. It ent go sell like how it selling now. Everybody go have it. Q: So why you don't do that now, start up a business, go legal [Shakes his head] Even to find a good location hard. And I need de money. I does help plenty people who ent have, make sure everybody eat. Q: You carry a gun [Pauses for a moment] De Bible say, if a man carry a gun, he have intention to kill. [Shakes his head] I not into that. Q: What is causing all the murder and gang warfare De police is de ones who does start ting. Is dem who does create de riot. I does deal wid everybody gang leaders, pushers, murderers. De police is de problem. I see a police vehicle coming to drop off the goods on a block. The block does deal weed, coke and guns. I watch that for weeks and months. And I say that ent right. I take myself and went to the police complainants [sic] building in town to tell them what going on. I meet the big man, he name __ ( name given), I never forget it. Next thing you know, about 28 police show up at my house with big guns and ransack the place. They cracking gun in my children face and cussing. But they ain't find nutten. Dey take me to kill me. I telling yuh. Dey carry me in de bush and beat me real bad.

De people living in fear. We cyah go to dem. But I go have to take things in my own hands. Is only God protecting me right now. Q: So all this talk by the Police Commissioner about cracking down on crime is a pappy show Things real dread this time around. Police putting gun in man hand and sending them to do thing. Is dem control de gangs and dem. Yuh ent hear [acting Commissioner of Police James ] Philbert say he go talk to de gang leaders I hear him say that on TV a night. So dey know who is to be killed. Right now is a whole seta small gangs and these fellas need protection so de police does protect them. Listen, is de old heads who corrupt. Dem old police who running tings for years. They have dem in every station. You have young ones who might want to come out clean and do things different but is pressure for them.

Q: What about the guns - who bringing them in Is de police who does take boat and go down to de border and cut dey flick wid de Guardia.

And dah's how yuh does hear man get hold, and dey report big bust and ting. Q: Is there a solution to crime If de police did know how to deal wid people, crime woulda done.

Seems as though we haven't learned from the SoE (state of emergency) that these steps alone bring no lasting benefit. We then have the customary use of \\\"statistics\\\", meant to illustrate the progress being made, progress that we, of course, remain totally unconvinced of. And just in case that doesn't work, we have ideas such as \\\"criminals killing criminals\\\" and the need to \\\"bleed to heal\\\" being touted. Judging by the amount of blood that has been shed over the past decade, we should be living in paradise by now. As if that isn't enough, you have cut prices of flour and rice to grab our attention. In the midst of all, the causal factors behind a lot of our criminal activity remain largely unaddressed. The primary underlying cause is international organised crime, especially drug, weapons and human trafficking and their accompanying offences, such as money laundering, corruption of legal and law enforcement bodies and destruction of communities. What action has been taken to deepen co-operation with international agencies It seems we can't even have adequate co-operation between our local agencies. What is being done to secure our porous borders Has any tangible action been taken in relation to money laundering The key to reducing crime is taking the money out of it. Another way to reduce money in the hands of the underworld is to legalise certain activities and put proper controls in place. Why not take a serious look at legalising certain drugs, updating our immigration policies to encourage the people we need to come and keep the ones we don't want out, and, of course, revamping our legal and penal systems to place a greater focus on restorative justice. Running a close second to international organised crime is corruption, a most insidious activity that seems to become more entrenched with each successive administration. Corruption and wastage take away resources and focus that should be used to develop the country's infrastructure, to educate our people and to build our international profile. Recently, we have seen senior administration personnel partying hard with persons accused of serious financial crimes. Would they consort freely with persons accused of robbery, rape and murder The fact that this has occurred in the shadow of the Section 34 debacle is a slap in the face of the populace. This would probably be listed as yet another \\\"misstep\\\", but what is the number of missteps that equates to incompetence. The lack of real economic development across too many areas in this rich country is another significant causal factor of crime. And no, being the second or third-richest country in the Caribbean isn't outstanding economic development. With our natural resources, geographical position and human resources, it's almost a shame. That's like Usain Bolt coming second in an under-15 race. Various governments haven't even put in place anti-crime measures such as computerisation of the Licensing Office, providing police with needed tools and technology, streamlining the Police Service, empowering communities and ensuring an efficient and well-funded judiciary. Lots of gun talk, chest-thumping and little to no real progress on the anti-crime front. We deserve and must demand better.

Filmed by Channel Four journalist Seyi Rhodes and director Will West during the 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew period of the still-ongoing State of Emergency, much of yesterday's episode features 'hotspots' in Port of Spain like Laventille and environs of East Port of Spain. In it, Rhodes and West, who obtained a curfew pass for the period, followed local police on visits through Laventille, which they called a \\\"notoriously violent area\\\". They painted a picture of a country under siege with an 'anything goes' atmosphere, as they describe parallels of feting sprees by some and killing sprees by others. According to Channel Four, half a million tourists flock to Trinidad every year for Carnival but the country also deals with a mostly gang-related murder every hours. Channel Four also reported that more than 4,000 people have been held during the SoE, where the army and police can enter and search a property without a warrant. The episode mentioned Calvary Hill as being the scene of scores of murders, where gang culture and drug dealing have spiralled out of control in the last decade. The team also interviewed a Calvary Hill resident identified only as 'Susan', a mother who saw two of her sons arrested on gang-related charges and who said she did not believe the SoE will bring an end to violence. Nelson Street in downtown Port of Spain was also highlighted, where Rhodes reported that \\\"the drug dealing that has blighted this area is still going on, in spite of the police presence\\\". Trinidad is then called \\\"a smugglers paradise\\\", an island of inlets and coves whose proximity to Venezuela has made it a major transshipment point for drugs heading to North America and Europe from South America. Guns brought in by drug smugglers to protect their shipments also make it onto the streets, once the drugs are gone, Channel Four reported. Rhodes also reported, \\\"According to UN estimates, in 2004 smugglers paid nearly 80 million a year in bribes to Trinidadian officials.\\\" The team spoke with National Security Adviser Gary Griffith, whom they called one of the \\\"architects\\\" of the SoE and one of its most outspoken supporters. Yet, Rhodes reported that Griffith agreed with him that the State of Emergency is \\\"completely ineffective\\\" in dealing with top-level crime. Asked why the government is focused on the SoE and neighbourhood crackdowns, rather than corruption, Griffith said: \\\"Every single country in the world will have corrupt politicians, corrupt police officers and persons in the judiciary. We needed that to stop law-abiding citizens from being killed.\\\" Unreported World, as Rhodes tells it, has found that the SoE has not led to any fundamental changes and he concluded that \\\"until the government tackles official corruption and the drug transshipment industry, drugs and guns will leak onto Trinidad's streets and the murders will continue\\\".

Then I went to the Piccadilly EC School in East Dry River. Our favourite game as schoolchildren in Carapichaima was \\\"Police and Thief\\\". In Piccadilly, it was \\\"Rescue\\\". Looking at those days from the perspective of the present, I can clearly see how nave we were in Carapichaima to make, and believe there was, a distinction between the two occupations. In the old western movies which were the mainstay of the Carapichaima cinema (now a church), the \\\"Sheriff\\\" was different from the \\\"Head Crook\\\". Even when we switched sides, there was no blurring of identities. In fact, we all wanted to be \\\"Police\\\" and catch thieves. I suppose that is why \\\"Police and Thief\\\" was not played in Port of Spain. People in Piccadilly were well aware that there were no boundaries between police and thieves. In those days the requirements for recruitment into the police \\\"force\\\" were a school-leaving certificate and a \\\"godfather\\\". The brighter kids had already left school and were either at high school or working. Those who could not make it in the academic or occupational worlds were \\\"on the block\\\" for a long period. Some of them got involved in petty crime and, if not caught (and sometimes even if they were), ended up as policemen. This was a \\\"rescue\\\" of sorts. However, those who made it never lost touch with their other friends and if you ever go to a Magistrate's Court anywhere in Trinidad, it is clear that the police of all ranks are closer to, and care more for, the criminals than for the rest of us law-abiding citizens. My lessons came later in Siparia where the police shot a man in the Savannah who we knew was unarmed and who later mysteriously turned up with a \\\"revolver\\\" which was really a toy gun. But how were the poor police supposed to know that A Corporal, who lived a few houses down the street from us, used to take things from my father's small, struggling shop without paying. He later became a Deacon of the Anglican Church and an Assistant Commissioner of Police. This is why I am never surprised when the police commit or are accused of committing crimes, both major and petty. Last week two policemen were suspended for alleged involvement in the escape from the Point Fortin police station of two dangerous criminals accused of murder (something that has happened before in other stations); a policeman who questioned a magistrate's judgment was supposed to have ended up in a Golden Grove cell overnight but instead was taken to the hospital by his colleagues. Despite a State of Emergency, the trade in women from Colombia is still proceeding as the lagniappe cargo to drugs and guns. Two policemen are accused of demanding and taking money from a Police Inspector's relative to hush up a driving incident. The list is legion. The good news is that there is now a Police Complaints Authority headed by Gillian Lucky. The bad news is that persons who have previously complained or borne witness against policemen end up dead, missing or absent in court. Given that the Government says it will bring back Corporal Punishment, the best news would be if they also impose Constable, Sergeant, Inspector, Superintendent and even Commissioner punishment.

Speaking at the PNM's public meeting in Point Fortin, Joseph explained that the reason there are currently high levels of crime was because of this country's location. He said Trinidad and Tobago is a major transshipment point between the drug-producing countries of South America and the drug- consuming countries of Europe and North America. He said the Government had invested a huge amount of taxpayers' dollars to acquire a 360 degree radar system and a fleet of vessels for the Coast Guard, so as to ensure those in the drug trade could be caught and found in our waters. As a result, this country now has the most number of marine assets ever seen in its history and still to come are three offshore patrol vessels. \\\"This Government is ensuring that we expand the Coast Guard's manpower to make sure the naval assets we require will ensure measures are put in place to reduce the inflow of drugs and guns coming into this country,\\\" Joseph said. \\\"And we can give you the assurance that once that is done, you can see a dramatic reduction in the level of crime and violence that continues to plague this country even now as we speak ... you have the assurance, it is not just ole talk, you have seen it manifested itself in terms of assets being acquired to make sure that we are going to address this problem,\\\" Joseph continued. Joseph added that to improve law enforcement, it was the PNM Government who brought legislation to give the Police Service Commission and Commissioner of Police more authority over the police. He said the police training academy has also been upgraded and the curriculum has been upgraded by expert help. He said Government also increased the number of police vehicles, adding that between 2002 and now, some 956 vehicles were purchased to bring the fleet up to 1425. \\\"We recognise and admit that crime is the number one issue. Those opposed to us want to make it the only issue, over the next two weeks they going to bombard you ... they go say Manning must go because of crime. Tell them they must go because your Government is putting measures in place to deal with crime,\\\" Joseph said. \\\"The war against illegal drugs and guns will continue in our next term ... your PNM government will not waiver, will not flinch from these responsibilities.\\\" He urged the people to find some quiet time and reflect on what the PNM government has done for this country before they go to vote on May 24.

Cyon Emmanuel Paul was fatally shot while he and his relatives were going to purchase food for his sister and himself. The agony and pain of Cyon's mother, Safiya Williams, can be felt in the image of her crying on the street where her son was murdered. What is even more heart-wrenching is the reality that Cyon's murder did not spark outrage and did not shake this country as it should. Whether it was said before or not, the reality is had Cyon been the son of a wealthy businessman, the son of a member of Government, the son of a foreigner, the son from a family of status, there would be calls for heads to roll, for no stone to be left unturned until his killer is brought to justice. Cyon is the son of a woman whose pain was splashed across the newspaper front page as she wept on the road, the spot where her son lost his life. \\u201cThey have to stop this drug war, stop it now. Too many innocent people getting killed. Put down your guns. Drugs life don't pay.\\u201d Safiya Williams was reported as saying. Her son's life was snuffed out, just short of his tenth birthday. Murder is murder regardless of the circumstances. Whether Cyon's death was a tragedy from gun, gang or drug warfare, at the end of the day, a young child is dead. Cyon was robbed of his life. When school reopens one week from today, his seat at the La Romaine Roman Catholic School will be empty. As a doctor I have delivered thousands of babies. The joy of holding a newborn, hearing his cry and taking his or her first breath of life is something that cannot be described. That baby is born with a purpose, with endless possibilities, vessels of hope. As a mother, I know a love that has no bounds, I've nurtured my children and watched them grow. Every day, every year is priceless and filled with so many amazing moments. The first step, the first words, the first day at school, the sweet curiosity, all beautiful memories to cherish for a lifetime. Imagine all that ending, with a single bullet. Have we as a nation become immune to the bloodshed Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley asserted that he is in charge of the National Security Council and law enforcement is being provided with all the resources it needs to fight the criminal elements. Why, then, are they losing the war on crime National Security Minister Edmund Dillon was reported saying that just a handful of criminals, ten per cent, were responsible for wreaking havoc on our nation and he called on police to make their lives miserable and not allow them to live in comfort. Sadly, it is the people in this country who are now paralysed with fear and living in discomfort. Where is safe today if a child can be killed by a stray bullet while going to purchase food So afraid are we that patients are now scheduling planned deliveries to avoid being on the streets at night. A few weeks ago, police presence was very noticeable on the highways when the speed guns came into the country. There was a grand show on how many speeding motorists were caught, and drivers were actually observing the speed laws. It was good while it lasted. Now, it seems the cops, like a kid with a new toy, have grown tired of the devices as their absence is noticeable and all caution by drivers is thrown to the wind. It sends the message that all the great plans and initiatives that are implemented in the crime fight are possibly not followed through long term. Gun-toting criminals are walking around unafraid because even if they are caught, our criminal justice system is like a monopoly game where you can get out of jail fast. The system is rotten and failing on different levels. Detection is poor, conviction and prosecution is poor and prevention is basically in the hands of citizens to protect themselves and their families by living under lock and key. But the criminals are even terrorising people in their homes. Nowhere is safe. As the new school term reopens I hope to see an increased police presence on the streets, many of our children commute and rely on public transport and they should be able to return to their homes safely without encountering the same tragedy as Cyon. There is no simple solution to fighting crime but when red blood flows freely, it is common sense there would be more blue lights around.

In a release, the CCIC, headed by Chamber president Richie Sookhai, commended the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on unearthing cocaine valued at US$100 million (TT$644m) in cans bearing the SM Jaleel Co Ltd labels of Trinidad Orange and Grapefruit juices and seized in Norfolk, Virginia in the United States. The CCIC stated that while praise is justly due for the work of foreign security entities, this issue emphasises the lack of or improper enforcement of this country's own security apparatus. \\\"The fact that millions of dollars of cocaine can leave this country packaged as canned juice is evident that something is wrong. This drug bust is embarrassing for Trinidad and Tobago and is a further blow to international investor confidence which is slipping daily as the big fish or fishes remain free,\\\" said Sookhai. \\\"The CCIC is alarmed that such a large quantity of illegal drugs can easily be moved from our borders without a trace and the question arises as to how long this has been happening undetected and whether the problem is of crisis proportions as it relates to human trafficking, especially of women and children,\\\" he added. Soohai stated that the Chamber was deeply concerned about the level of crime that continues to grip this country and the worrying trend of a low detection rate. \\\"National Security ministers, both past and present, have publicly stated that this country is a transhipment hub where drugs and guns enter our communities and into the hands of our youth fuelling gang warfare. It is time for action,\\\" stated the release. The CCIC issued a call for the People's Partnership Government and the relevant authorities to ensure that our borders are guarded, both land and sea. It noted that billions of taxpayers' money was spent on the crime fight over the past decade and questioned what was there to show for it. According to Sookhai, technology must be instrumental in the war against crime and high-tech scanners and radar machines such as those used in the US must be implemented. \\\"A simple measure such as the use of sniffer dogs at our airports and ports can go a long way in detecting the movement of illegal substances,\\\" stated the release. The CCIC said a holistic approach was needed where various bodies work together to combat the crime scourge. \\\"Where are the regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies e.g. Customs, banks and the Financial Intelligence Agency (FIU) These are institutions that were supposed to be sharing information and yet no one was able to identify any suspicious transaction,\\\" it stated. The CCIC advised that citizens play their role in the crime fight and make reports to the police. \\\"The CCIC also calls on the people of the nation to be thy neighbour's keeper and while the Chamber urges everyone to guard themselves, remember your civic duty and report any illegal activities.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Cort made the statement while delivering the feature address at Wednesday's project launch, entitled \\\"Strengthening Caricom Co-operation to Reduce Gun Crime\\\", at the Hilton Trinidad in St Ann's. Among those in attendance were National Security Minister Brigadier John Sandy, executive director of the Caricom Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (Impacs), Lynne Anne Williams, Commissioner of Police Dwayne Gibbs and representatives of the Canadian High Commission. \\\"On the heels of this launch, it is also anticipated that the region will see the initiation of the Regional Integrated Ballistic Information Network (RIBIN). RIBIN will be used to identify the \\\"fingerprint\\\" of the ammunition used in a crime and to record the details of the firearm used. This will further complement one of the objectives of the project to effectively document information pertaining to small arms and light weapons,\\\" Cort said. Cort said the region has not been silent amidst calls to reduce the demand for and the supply of illegal drugs, but \\\"with the assistance of the European Union and through Caricom Impacs, the Caricom Regional Demand Reduction and Caricom Capacity Building Programme for Law Enforcement, member states have benefitted from both training and upgrades\\\". Adding the Caribbean community has an influx of organised crime and gang-related activities, Cort said these activities are spawned through drug-trafficking, \\\"which are accompanied by high levels of homicide, in which illegal guns feature more than 70 per cent of the time\\\". Counsellor for the High Commission of Canada to T&T, Laurent Morel-a-l'Huissier, who also spoke, said approximately $12 million is being spent on the three-year project. \\\"This project, which is being undertaken through a partnership involving Caricom Impacs, Project Ploughshares, the Institute of International Relations at the University of the West Indies (UWI) and Caribbean civil society organisations, was conceptualised from a mutual commitment to control the illicit proliferation and misuse of small arms in the Caribbean. Guns are frequently traded between countries in exchange for drugs, food and appliances,\\\" Morel-a-l'Huissier said. \\\"It is not unreasonable to expect the possibility and high probability, for one gun to be used to commit crime in one member state then show up at one or more crime scenes in other member states.\\\" Morel-a-l'Huissier said the project will be implemented through a partnership between Canadian-based NGOs and Caricom.

Clearly it's about protecting its turf (gun and drug running) so that its system can murder more black people in Laventille, Beetham, Sea Lots etc. As long as there is military presence in Laventille no one can ship guns and drugs into Laventille. The presence of soldiers have cut off easy gun and drug smuggling into the top local market Laventille. So every rogue police, lawyer, judge, businessperson, politician is fuming mad and want soldiers out of the area so they can revive their ill dealings. Captain Gary Griffith usurped command of a handful of soldiers loyal to him and they are carrying out the unfolding crime plan we're now witnessing. Murderers are in hiding since martial law was instituted on Laventille. Since soldiers rolled into Laventille under orders from Gary Griffith, unknown to Major General Kenrick Maharaj, murderers have been distracted from murdering. No murderers have been arrested thus far. Thirty persons known to the police were killed by the police. If they were murderers we'll never know. When there was a murder every day, people complained. A functioning solution has stopped the murders and now they are complaining about the solution. Since Mr Griffith's soldiers rolled in, have there been any killings No. That's a good thing Guess if it makes the People's Partnership Government look effective it's bad. Since the soldiers took up patrols in Laventille you can't name any person who was killed there. The soldiers are solving a problem. They deserve credit not ridicule. Whether the Opposition would like to admit it or choose to deny what is happening for political expedience the proof is in the lack of dead bodies. At this time people ought to be thankful a week has passed and not one person was murdered there. But no, the Opposition supporters are mad that the Partnership Government executed another successful initiative. One that is keeping citizens from untimely death. You can't please politico-centric Trinis. When bodies were piling up in Laventille they berated the authorities about the murders. Now that the authorities have stopped the murders, they are berating the Government about stopping the arm of authority that stopped the murders. I understand the politico-centrics are against the use of soldiers to bring the prevailing calm in Laventille for political reasons but they are entitled to their opinion. In the meantime residents here are entitled to freedom from chaos and bloodshed. If the politio-centrics can't come to terms with that, too bad.

FIRE POWER: Gangsters brandish new high-tech guns in the Laventille area in late June. GANGSTERS are brandishing far superior high-tech weapons than the police and other law enforcement agencies in this country. Photographs obtained by TV6s news investigative team from well-placed intelligence sources show three young men posing with these weapons. Two of the men are holding two of the guns in their hands, while the next man with a thick gold chain is holding one in his hand. In another photograph the man with the gold chain is sitting on a rock and has two guns on his lap and two in his hands. All the guns in the picture appear spanking new. These photographs were taken in late June this year in the Laventille area and have raised major concerns in law enforcement circles as they grapple with the homicide rate that has escalated in this area in the last two months. Sources at the police Crime and Problem Analysis Branch said at least 85 per cent of the homicides for the year are gun-related. The reason for this mounting concern is the firepower that these gangsters are packing. The guns in the pictures are no ordinary guns. They are in fact AR-15 guns. This semi-automatic weapon in the hands of proven criminals can do serious damage. Allison Hamilton, assistant secretary of the Trinidad Rifle Association, who has expertise about these weapons shared his insight. What I know is that they are used by the US army and a lot of other armies around the world so they are serious weapons of war. For weapons like that to be in the hands of people on the street is a frightening situation. The AR-15s firing capacity lives up to its menacing appearance. This semi-automatic weapon fires one round per pull of the trigger before reloading itself. So while it cannot unleash a hail of bullets like a fully automatic weapon, it can fire as quickly as the gunman can pull the trigger. This was in fact the exact weapon used by alleged shooter James Holmes in the Colorado theatre shooting at the premiere of the Dark Knight on July 20 last year in which 12 people were killed and more than 70 injured. We have tangible evidence to suggest the gangsters in the hills of Laventille are using these weapons to zone in on targets in the East Port of Spain area, the source said. Residents along Nelson and Duncan Streets also claim that while they are out in the yard among the buildings they are shot at, and even showed bullet hole impressions left in the walls. Children are playing here sometimes and they start to shoot at us, said one woman who didnt want to be named. Several gun experts online describe this weapon as rugged, reliable, portable and accurate. Intelligence police sources say gangsters here use two different types of ammunition with the AR-15, with either one having deadly consequences. The .556 have something like a .22 projectile and .762 have something like a 9mm projectile, the effective distance of the .762 is a lot further than the .556 but both are equally damaging to its target,explained Hamilton. The fragmentation of these ammunition can do greater damage to humans internally, travelling at a higher velocity, Hamilton pointed out. We showed the photographs of the high powered rifles to acting Police Commissioner Stephen Williams who appeared taken aback by the weapons. Those weapons hitting the streets of Trinidad and Tobago also provide this kind of shocking impact to me having to lead an organisation where my officers are out there and have to be confronted with that kind of fire power by criminal elements, he said. A testimony to the Commissioners words came in May this year following the John John protests. Intelligence sources revealed to TV6 News that gangsters warned police not to venture up the tracks and other areas since they would be sniped by shooters. To date, according to Williams, the police have recovered 232 firearms and though he views this as a high number, in his books it is still not enough. In fact, in police gun seizures for the year they never once came upon a weapon like the AR-15,Williams indicated. Intelligence sources are convinced these specific weapons are not only coming from South America but also directly from the USA, since these kind of weapons can be easily broken down and concealed for shipment. The mere fact that the police arent able to find these guns is worrisome and terrifying said the top cop. The critical thing when we look at weapons like those is about getting them off the streets because weapons like those could hurt this country big time, the flow of blood which can be generated through the use of anyone of those weapons could be massive and disastrous, said Williams as he shifted uneasily in his chair. But the question really is how these guns are getting into the country and whats the deal on the streets Williams said they are planning to tighten up security at the sea ports and airports as they attempt to clamp down on contraband entering the country. But one crime boss along the East West corridor speaking to us on the condition that he concealed his identity, did not sugar coat his underworld dealings with guns,drugs and other nefarious activities. We have AR-15s, AKs, nines we dealing with. We dont sell our gun, that is to protect we self and we turf.

Terminate the officers that are not performing their duties and upholding the laws of the land, the ones involved in criminal activities, and reward the ones that do their job effectively, which they were sworn to do. I agree that the officers also needs help to perform well. Give incentives that would encourage young people to become officers. However, assist the officers now with computers in the stations, that would link all the stations with pertinent information needed to capture criminals. Increase the amount of vehicles that patrols the streets, with updated radio systems, have more highway patrol to crack down on speeding which will decrease the amount of fatal accidents that occur daily. Cracking down on drunk driving which leads to many fatalities. Increase neighborhood patrol, detering criminals from home invasions, burglary, assaults and especially drug dealing. Too many guns are gettng into this country, and no one seems to want to crack down on this.

Inset: Crime Scene experts view the victim's car. \\u0097Photos: ANISTO ALVES THE WEST End Police Station in Diego Martin, the scene of yesterday's horrific murder and also one of the five model police stations in the country, was voted by residents as making the area safer, National Security Minister Martin Joseph says. Speaking at yesterday's Senate sitting, Joseph disclosed that a survey was conducted by consultant Roger D Parkes to examine the reaction of the people to the five model stations located in West End, Morvant, Arouca, Chaguanas and San Fernando. Joseph said model police stations were introduced to change the way in which police do business. These stations, he noted, are more equipped with resources and also officers. He said some 3000 persons were surveyed between January 3 and March 16 this year, and it was found that residents felt safer with the increased police presence and model stations. \\\"You are seeing a change ... not as rapid as we would like to see, but the seeds have been planted and you are going to be seeing an improvement in some of the areas,\\\" Joseph said. Joseph also took the opportunity to defend the $80 million Mastrofski initiative to transform the police service. He pointed out that large sums of money are expended to run the police service and some $1.3 billion was spent last year. \\\"The investment in bringing someone to help identify what is necessary to transform the police service is an investment well spent,\\\" he said. He also spoke of the Government's heavy investment in Coast Guard vessels, giving the assurance that with a full functioning naval fleet, the drugs and guns flowing into this country would be stemmed. Joseph added that although the murder rate had surpassed the rates in 2007 and 2008, the level of detection had increased slightly. He noted that in 2008, the detection rate from January 1 to June 23 was 18.8 per cent and for this year there was a slight increase to 21.7 per cent. Acknowledging the endless calls for his resignation, Joseph said the transformation of the police service and the effect of all the initiatives of the Government would take time to reap results. Admitting that the process was taking longer than expected, he said Government will continue to build the capacity of law enforcement not just for now but for the future. \\\"We are going to continue to provide the resources and ensure all law enforcement agencies are provided with the resources necessary so that this war against crime can in fact be won,\\\" he said.

It therefore cannot be solved by any one ministry. There has to be a united effort of the various ministries of the government throughout the Public Service. The Education Ministry, for example, must get together to make a national onslaught on the runaway crime situation. Discipline must return to the schools and all public institutions, the Public Service as a whole must become less corruptible and be more service oriented. The Police Service must rid itself of the rogue elements with strong punitive measures against errant police officers. Teachers must instill a sense of fairplay and discipline in the schools, backed up by the ministry and the Teaching Service Commission. The Ministry of Transport must institute strong measures to curb the reckless driving and the breaking of the traffic laws all over the country. In the homes, parents must take an active part in the welfare and upbringing of their children and set an example of good behaviour among their charges. Truant officers should be appointed to ensure every child of school age attends school. The drug trade must be curtailed by not only increasing the penalties for possession and using but all fishing ports must be manned by army and police officers to ensure drugs are not brought in or taken out of the country. The possession of illegal firearms must be punishable by life imprisonment and confiscation of all properties. At the same time, citizens with properties to protect should all be given guns for their own protection and the law of justifiable homicide adopted.

He referred to the incident in September 2011 when a shipping container of chicken parts \\\"seasoned with marijuana\\\" was discovered at the Point Lisas port. He noted the Government and National Security Ministry had announced 23 initiatives to tackle crime including an advisory council...aerial surveillance, strengthening of the Police Service, dedicated highway patrol unit, regulation of private security industry and maritime security. \\\"Almost none of those things has been done. But we keep on passing laws,\\\" he said. He continued: \\\"I think from the last administration to this one, we should realise by now that passing laws targets crime at the retail end. The little boy with the gun and the rock of cocaine are not the importers.\\\" He said the country needed to get serious about protecting our borders but this administration has \\\"failed miserably\\\" cancelling the Offshore Patrol Vessels and using the associated helicopters for personal use. He noted the previous People's National Movement administration gave this Government a national security apparatus \\\"on a silver platter\\\" and \\\"you did nothing with it\\\". Deyalsingh was contributing to the Senate debate on Tuesday night on the Miscellaneous Provisions (Defence and Police Complaints) Bill at Tower D, International Waterfront Centre, Port of Spain. Deyalsingh pointed out that police officers with all their training and years of experience at times misapply the judge's rules (guidelines about police and questioning and the acceptability of the resulting statements and confessions as evidence in court) leading to cases collapsing. He predicted that when soldiers, who lack that institutional learning, are detaining and arresting people more cases could be thrown out. He also questioned whether a soldier would appreciate the suspect's constitutional rights and would they be trained in police procedure and in these rights also. He said the legislation would create a \\\"bifurcation\\\" as there would be a duality of recording of informationthe soldier and the police officerand there would be ambiguity and blurred lines of responsibility as the soldiers would not know which superior officer to obey.

In the course of that column I referred yet again to the impunity with which murder and other crimes are committed and had a bit of a sardonic smile that it has taken so many so long to see that the impunity factor was at the heart of our crisis. The column also reflected yet again on the lack of political will and on law enforcement failure to disrupt the drug trade, which have bred and maintained the impunity factor. This is what I wrote in May 2003: \\u201cWe must pressure the Government, whoever they are, to take back control of the resources of the State from cronies and pardners, armed or unarmed. That is a political job. It is not the job of the police. Their job is to attack first, and with urgency and integrity, the drug trade that underlies the gang murders\\u201d. That column published 13 years ago continued: \\u201cIf any Government does not act independently of the criminal element in the society, whether they are grassroots bandits or the 'devils in disguise' in our Westwood Parks, the regulation of society in the interest of the common good will eventually become impossible. The laws of the land will have legal validity but will cease to be effective.\\u201d It must be clearly understood that law enforcement failure is not a failure of the police alone. It includes the Coastguard, the Customs and the Inland Revenue, the latter being able to strike by assessments of conspicuous consumption. The Judiciary also has a responsibility to increase the speed of the delivery of criminal justice beyond \\u201cworking like molasses running uphill\\u201d. The molasses comparison comes from a recent editorial in the Barbados Nation newspaper. Earlier this month Barbados was thrown into a state of shock when a drug trade operative was gunned down at the entrance to a restaurant, and within the compound of the busiest area in Warrens, the Massy complex. The security camera video of the shooting was released. In the words of the editorial: \\u201cThere was no need for a single Barbadian to speculate or gossip about what occurred. In living colour, the world saw the killers and the victim, the multiple flashes from the muzzles of the guns, and the deliberateness of the murderers as they carried out their execution. Commenting on another shooting, the editorial pointed out the obvious wider danger: \\u201cTaken with the reports of the apparent use of AK-47 assault rifles during the gunplay at Wotton, we do not believe that under the circumstances, many people will apply much weight to the oft-offered suggestions that ordinary Barbadians need not worry since these shootings and resultant deaths really relate to members of the underworld settling scores.\\u201d Readers will recall reference a few weeks ago to reports of a former Attorney General and Chief Justice of Barbados, Sir David Simmons, having spoken on Barbados radio about the dangers of politicians \\u201clying in bed with the underworld\\u201d. As indicated then, Sir David was reported as saying that \\u201cthroughout the Caribbean, especially Trinidad and Jamaica, there was evidence which showed political parties embraced gang leaders and drug lords\\u201d including politicians involving those criminals in State-funded projects Forgive me therefore if I regard all current talk about co-operation on legislation as largely irrelevant. Tinkering with bail, the jury system and the laws of evidence are plasters for a big, in your face, running sore, which can be curtailed only by an all out bi-partisan attack on the drug trade and on corruption facilitated by the out of control state enterprise and statutory authority system and sawatee Chairpersons. The State enterprise/statutory authority system also masks incompetence and undermines accountability. For example, a Minister of Sport refers the media for answers to the SPORTT Company. It is massively ironic that there is now controversy about occupation of lands in the Chaguaramas peninsula. Why did Dr Eric Williams march to get the US base out of there only for new occupiers to be let in there in circumstances in which Ministerial accountability and underlying policy for the use of valuable State lands and public access to parkland are so far very opaque Since 2002 I have maintained in these columns that the state enterprise/statutory authority system leaves plenty of wriggle room for Ministers and no means of knowing whether the Boardroom has acted in response to clandestine Ministerial nods and winks. The Barbados gun-down took place just before the opening of the Barbados law term. Ours opened two days ago. One comment on the Nation's editorial took the form of a quote from Ecclesiastes: \\u201cBecause the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.\\u201d And so say all of us. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

Governments, national security ministers and police commissioners have changed over the years with no significant effect on crime, especially murders. Arising out of a spike in murders over the last three weeks, the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader finally met and agreed on certain initiatives to address the problem. In addition, the PM installed Gary Griffith as the new National Security Minister, that being the highlight of the ministerial reshuffle. These events play out like a recurring decimal \\u2013 desperate reactions to appease the public when murders skyrocket. The leaders/politicians of this land are educated and must know the requirements to effectively address the crime dilemma. So why are only feeble attempts made to contain crime rates and restore law and order Are our leaders serious about fighting crime or more interested in nepotism, cronyism, serving themselves and \\\"mudslinging\\\" their opponents Note that the PM's most recent appeal to the Opposition to work together was rejected by Dr Rowley \\u2013 another indication that the love for power trumps addressing the needs of the people. We can be sure that his prior pronouncement on working with the Government to control crime was a mere farce. The authorities know that guns, ammunition and drugs literally flood certain coastal areas. So a few marine vessels and helicopters were purchased some time ago to show the public that something is being done to eradicate, if not, curtail this illegal influx via our shores. With T&T's coastline length being 362 km or 225 miles and with the continuation of murders via shootings the public is aware that not nearly enough is being done to arrest the thriving illegal importation of guns and ammunition. The death penalty is cited as a deterrent for murder, yet the Government and Opposition continue to play \\\"footsie\\\" with the issue, as the label \\\"Death Row\\\" is a joke. Prisoners sent there generally have their death sentences commuted to life imprisonment. This lack of enforcement indicates to criminals and would-be murderers that the law is not to be feared \\u2013 it's a joke. Apart from the lack of law enforcement, high crime rates are aided by insufficient law enforcers. But although a significant number of citizens apply to the Police Service, only a fraction appear to meet the required standards. So when crime spikes the army is called out to assist. It is obvious that a more permanent solution must be employed. Has serious consideration been given to making the job of a police officer more attractive, or at least attractive enough to woo more suitable applicants In the area of crime prevention, the Government's basketball tournament among specific communities was a good incentive that needs to be maintained and even broadened. More tournaments will create more sporting goals and less time for idleness and crime. Part of our problem is the lack of support for ideas/plans that work. If the authorities are serious about fighting crime, prisoners not consigned to Death Row must be afforded more rehabilitative incentives to curb recidivism. A serious approach to fighting crime must also include a speedy process for court matters and related sentencing, disbursements, etc. This plan must also ensure fairness to all people regardless of social status, race, skin colour, sexual orientation and political persuasion. We, the average citizens, must play our critical role too, as many of us flaunt the law at every opportunity. Driving with a cellphone at our ears and running red traffic lights are examples. Still, there is a perception that many folks would provide more information on crime to the police when a certain level of trust is restored. It appears that more co-operation from the public is dependent, to some extent, on the rooting out of rogue law enforcers from the system.

In his contribution to debate on the national budget, the recently appointed Minister said that the lock-down will not entail the use of three Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) but one long range patrol vessel which was all that was required to secure the countrys economic zone from 12 to 200 miles. In addition, Griffith said that eight fast patrol vessels will be acquired to protect Trinidad and Tobagos waters from the border to two miles. He said the second tier involved the use of naval vessels which will complement the operations of the fast patrol interceptor vessels. Griffith stressed that a lock-down can only be effective if there is proper communication through an operations centre where all arms of law enforcement can work together. He said the national security operations centre will be implemented to provide that operational link between the police, army, coast-guard, air guard and other arms of law enforcement. Griffith said that the police and other authorities must be given the tools that they require to successfully combat crime and while there are some rogue elements the hard-working officials must be respected for their efforts. The Minister also disclosed that within the last year over 250 firearms were seized including 68 revolvers, 115 pistols, 19 shot guns, 3 sub machine guns, 9 rifles, 37 home made guns and 6 trap guns.

According to police reports, around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, officers of the Task Force noticed two men acting suspiciously as they off-loaded boxes from a vessel docked at the Caricom Open Wharf. The vessel is said to have arrived from St Vincent. The officers allowed the men to unpack their cargo. As the men tried to exit the port in a car, however, they were stopped near the Tobago ferry terminal. The vehicle was searched and some 24 kilogrammes of marijuana were found stuffed inside 18 banana boxes with false bottoms. The driver of the vehicle and its lone passenger are currently being held at the Central Police Station. The duo, aged 35 and 38, are expected to appear before a Port of Spain magistrate today. The seizure was made by Cpl Joseph and PCs Sookoo, Ashby and Sinanan, of the Port Police Task Force. The seizure by the Port Police Task Force comes one day after a $107 million marijuana eradication exercise in Biche. Speaking to the Express by telephone yesterday, National Security Minister Gary Griffith applauded the efforts of all this countrys law enforcement officials in the fight against crime and ridding the streets of guns and drugs. Griffith said the collaborative efforts of this countrys law enforcement officials have resulted in several key drug and gun busts. He said last month one of the highest levels of gun seizures was reported. On December 20 last year, Customs and Border Protection officers seized 732 pounds of cocaine, valued at US$100 million, concealed in cans bearing the labels of Trinidad Orange and Grapefruit juices at the Port of Norfolk in Virginia, USA. Griffith said local law enforcement was able to help in the seizure of 800 kilogrammes of cocaine seized off Azores by the Spanish Guardia on the sailing yacht Bucannero. The value of this seizure was three times that of the DEA bust and valued at US$300 million. He said local law enforcement was also integral in the seizure in 310 kilogrammes of cocaine by French Customs on the sailing yacht Blue Eye in Martinique. The value of that bust was US$100 million. He said the country can expect more busts to come, as citizens have started to show confidence in local law enforcement to treat with their tips. We have many more hits that will take place soon, and this has to do with what I call HUMIT, human intelligence. It is assisting us in trying to get the information we need and it is assisting the law-enforcement agencies greatly towards successful operations, Griffith said.

Photo: STEPHEN DOOBAY Pocketed by bullets, the front wall of the home of Joel LePlatte who was killed in front of his house on Mon Coco Road, Maraval last Thursday night along with two friends. Photo: STEPHEN DOOBAY On the night of the machine gun murders of three men in Maraval last Thursday, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley was contacted in Houston, Texas and informed of the bloodshed in his capacity as head of the National Security Council. This was disclosed last Thursday by Attorney General Faris Al Rawi during a press briefing at the Ministry of National Security, Abercromby Street, Port of Spain. Al-Rawi was supported by Minister of National Security Edmund Dillon, and acting Commissioner of Police, Stephen Williams. Al-Rawi said: \\u201cI was in communication with the Prime Minister while he was aboard, up to about 1 a.m as the members of the National Security Council tracked closely the ongoing situation with respect to crime in Trinidad and Tobago . Last night the country witnessed in Le Platte Village, innocent bystanders caught in what appears to be machine gun fire, where the allegation is that a well known criminal was targeted and executed. And so indiscriminate was the action, that it didn't matter to anyone who was carrying out the crime that innocent by standers would be caught. As a government we warned in the past in parliament that it only takes one person with a machine gun to change the murder statistic in a horrible way overnight. and this is where we are,\\u201d Al-Rawi said. The killings claimed the lives of Kaundi Critchlow, 24, Collins Letren, 25, and Joel Le Platte, 35, Link with drug busts The Attorney General said that from his information, there was an increase in gang activities in the country due to the amount of drugs being seized in recent months. \\u201cThere is an obvious correlation between the amount of interdiction done re drugs and the effect that it is going to have with those who are deprived of the profit of the trade. Someone in T&T lost $837 million worth of product when 4.3 tonnes of cocaine was interdicted. Someone in T&T lost money when marijuana was interdicted in the Caribbean Sea, so the correlation is obvious,\\u201d Al-Rawi said. Dillon and Williams expressed similar sentiments, saying that the incidents have put special focus on the need for the Police Service and the Government to put in a collaborative effort to deal with the explosion of violence which has been reported over the past month, especially in the Central Division, the Northern Division, and the Western Division. Dillon said the State will be working on all fronts to ensure that an operational and legislative approach was taken to tackle crime and gang related activities in these districts. The Minister also lamented that the lack of Opposition support for the Anti Gang and Bail Act, which was defeated in July 2016, had hindered the police's ability to seek out gang members and gang-related activity, so the Police Service no longer had power to make arrests without warrants, conduct searches of persons believed to be affiliated with gangs, and hold these persons for 120 days. Williams supported Dillon's comments, noting that without the backing of appropriate legislation, the hands of the police service were tied. \\u201cI hear the discussion about the police service enforcing the gang law in the public domain but there seems to be an important part of that discussion missing- that there are no gang laws in Trinidad and Tobago to date. This part of the discussion seems to be lost. As it is right now, T&T is one of the few countries in the region without legislation in addressing a dedicated problem which everybody in this country is aware of,\\u201d Williams said. However, despite the \\u201chandicap\\u201d, Williams assured that the Police Service would be taking a \\u201chard\\u201d approach against criminality in this country, and will do everything within their power to ensure the prosecution of persons caught committing illegal activities. THE SHOOTINGS According to police reports, on Thursday night, Critchlow, Letren, and Le Pllatte, were all liming along the roadway with a group of people, including cousins Dominique Le Platte and Dayna Le Platte. At about 7.30 p.m., a black motor vehicle pulled outside the group and a man was seen pointing what appeared to be a firearm in the direction of the group. There was a brief exchange of words, following which several loud explosions were then heard, in rapid succession. The vehicle and its armed assailants then sped off. When the dust settled, five persons were said to have received gunshot injuries, while three others were said to have received superficial injuries. The police and emergency health services were notified and a team of officers from the Western Division and the Homicide Bureau responded. Letren and Critchlow died on the scene. Joel Le Platte had suffered gunshot injuries to his head, left wrist and right thigh. As a result, he was rushed to the Port of Spain General Hospital where he was treated. However, doctors were unable to operate on the 35-year-old man as the hospital did not have a functioning CT Scanner to locate the bullet. As a result the wounded man was transferred to the Eric Williams Medical Sciences complex where he was examined. There, instructions were given to return Le Platte to the General Hospital. The 35-year-old man died minutes after returning to the Port of Spain Hospital, police said. Cousins Dominique Le Platte, and Dayna Le Platte, received no life threatening gunshot injuries.

In its report dated December 31, 2009, the Small Arms Survey of Switzerland explored the rise of criminal gangs and gangster-styled killings in Trinidad and Tobago and concluded the country's gun problems were not going to go away. The 53-page report is entitled ''No Other LifeGangs, Guns and Governance in Trinidad and Tobago.\\\" It opens with the tale of known gangster and sometimes political golden boy Sean \\\"Bill\\\" Francis who was gunned down last year, his body riddled with 50 bullets. This section of the report, says the author, Dorn Townsend, is meant to \\\"set the scene\\\". Townsend paints a grim picture of a wealthy but corrupt, segregated and generally \\\"out-of-its-league\\\" island nation that appears to be falling before even reaching grace. Stating in the paper's executive summary that gun-related homicides have increased 1,000-fold in the last decade, Townsend goes on in the next chapter to recall at the start of the 21st century, T&T was pegged to be the jewel of the Caribbean, a haven of relative stability. \\\"That is no longer the case,\\\" he said. The report is based on information garnered from various local sources, including the media, police, university professors and non-governmental organisations. \\\"This scene is not so much a 'war zone' as a 'Wild West', and it is no exaggeration to say that poor urban areas of Trinidad, in particular, have become magnets for lawlessness as rival gangs vie for control of territory where drugs are sold,\\\" the report said. Townsend said the explosion of this type of crime occurred during a period of unparalleled economic development and that up to the 2008/2009 economic downturn, T&T enjoyed one of the steadiest economic growth rates in the world. \\\"Overwhelmingly,\\\" Townsend stated, \\\"the violence is occurring among the country's poor, urban, African rather that its Indian or Caucasian residents. Primarily, city blacks are the victims.\\\" The report refers to or focuses, in several instances, on places known locally as hot spots, such as Laventille and Gonzales, and mentions efforts by legitimate community and church leaders to bring peace to these areas. Yet, Townsend stated: \\\"T&T's society though small in size is significantly complex, such that as a variety of forces stand arrayed against efforts at improvement.\\\" Exploring the alleged and known relationships between political leaders and gang leaders, Townsend stated: \\\"Also arrayed, or covertly arrayed, against such pressures for stability are the leaders of political parties who cultivate goodwill with gangs.\\\" And concluded: \\\"The above progressive and retrogressive forces are only suggestive of what is unfolding with regard to gangs and guns in T&T. Other markers of the problems may be brought to the fore. In turn, concerned stakeholders may develop a viable strategy for peace while controlling elements of the violent status quo. \\\"In any event, the national's problems of guns is not going to go away. Steps by the government to bolster law enforcement and curb smuggling are hobbled by a worsening of civic attitudes, ie citizens are downright cynical about the ability of the State to reverse the mayhem caused by guns and gangs.\\\" The Small Arms Survey is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International and Developmental Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. It was established in 1999 and is supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairsn while being sustained by contributions from the governments of Belgium, Canada, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK. The project's objective is, among others, to serve as the principal source of public information on all aspects of small arms and armed violence, as a resource centre for governments, policy-makers, researchers and activists, to monitor national and international initiatives (governmental and non) on small arms.

The report also said the majority of drugs smuggled through T&T borders ended up, not in the US, but in other territories, including Europe, due to \\\"direct international flights to Europe as well as the ease of flow within the Caribbean and to Western Africa.\\\" The report also said illegal drugs were being smuggled out on yachts, air and sea cargo, or by couriers, and through the use of drug swallowers, which was on the rise. One of the illegal drugs being smuggled through T&T borders was heroin, and local authorities fear that this narcotic could add to the nation's drug problem and fuel even more gangland violence. Police believe heroin has already been the cause of the murder of one major drug dealer, Merlin 'Kojo' Allamby, who was shot dead last July. Last year, just over 27 kilogrammes of heroin were seized by lawmen, the largest amount ever seized locally. Local street value for heroin averages at $600,000 a kilogramme compared with $400,000 for a kilogramme of cocaine. In September last year, National Security Minister Martin Joseph suggested that heroin could soon become the nation's next drug epidemic. \\\"We're starting to see an increase in the transhipment of heroin coming through this country because I understand heroin fetches a much better price than cocaine,\\\" Joseph had said in Parliament. \\\"When cocaine first started transhipping through this country, you know what was the reaction of law enforcement Trinidadians and Tobagonians don't use cocaine, so what is the big thing Failing to realise that changes occur,\\\" Joseph said then. \\\"Back then cocaine didn't used to be accompanied by guns. People weren't using it so as a result there wasn't any rivalry. And then other things started to develop. They started to come with the guns, stayed, they started to use cocaine as payment and then it started to stay in the society and create problems. \\\"I have said to law enforcement, we must not make the same mistake that we made with cocaine. And I understand that heroin is a drug, the consequences of which is even worse than cocaine, so that we have to be very vigilant,\\\" Joseph said. While there have been no heroin busts for the year, officers attached to the Organised Crime, Narcotics and Firearms Bureau say that smugglers are \\\"always creative in the way they evade law enforcement.\\\" Heroin smuggling first began showing up in Trinidad and Tobago in 2000 with the seizure of a little over half a kilogramme in a police raid. Narcotics officers said they saw an increase in heroin smuggling in 2003. Between 2003 and beginning of 2005, police, mainly the Organised Crime, Narcotics and Firearms Bureau, seized a reported 39.275 kilogrammes of heroinworth about $23.6 million. The United States State Department, in its 2006 drug report, said that a total of 15.58 kilogrammes of heroin were seized in Trinidad in 2005.

The CIC football team in action. No one can disagree with the series of initiatives that form the substance of the collaboration between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the issue of crime in East Port of Spain. While many of the proposed measures are hardly new, having been bandied about for years, the cooperation between the rival parties does indeed bring a new element into the equation. On the basis that two heads are a lot better than one, the public will hope to be spared the missteps that have tended to accompany the Peoples Partnership Governments implementation of strategies. The approach outlined by both leaders suggests a multifaceted strategy designed to streamline the management systems of the police service, enhance its material and human resources and tighten the criminal justice system. While on paper, it all sounds very useful, raising our hopes at this stage would be premature. If we sound a little jaded, it is because none of these strategies is new. It has long been clear that we do not have an effective system for developing and selecting the best candidate for Commissioner. We also already know that there are no shortcuts to a fully resourceful Police Service with enough people and equipment. Even so, providing more and better-equipped cars are more of the same, as is the plan to train and involve Special Reserve Police officers. If they didnt know it before, the disaster of the Defence Amendment Bill should have taught the Government that it would have been better off working to fill the large number of vacancies in the Police Service instead of trying to change the law to allow the precepting of soldiers. The idea of tightening the law to better protect witnesses and to review the anti-gang legislation and the Bail Act speak more to improving weak legislation than to developing new strategy. While all of these initiatives are important, the question is whether they will be enough to bring crime under control and to turn the situation around. The dimensions of the problem of crime are so broad and deep, that no one approach will inspire confidence. This is where one would have expected the Ryan Committees plan on crime to guide the way. Unfortunately, given its very limited insight into the problem, the plan has provided little guidance to the Governments effort. The proposed plan for the redevelopment of East Port of Spain is another useful component in a more sustainable effort against crime. However, in the context of daily murders, a medium-term plan does not offer the immediate relief that we all seek. From whatever angle the problem is contemplated, a top priority now must be to get guns out of the hands of those caught up in the crime wave and, even more importantly, to disrupt the supply of guns and drugs at the source.

Well, hotter than usual in this T&T, where crime business is regularly left abruptly unfinished, and mysteries lie strewn around like long-time children's unopened wonder bags. One bag whose contents stirred wonder two weeks ago was found in the trunk of a Gold Honda Civic parked in a Sea Lots police holding area. Other police, acting on \\\"tip-off\\\", swooped down on the area, opened the car trunk, and discovered 55 kilogrammes of ganja. \\\"The officers said they believed officers of the Stolen Vehicles Unit were part of the ploy to smuggle the drugs undetected,\\\" the Guardian reported. Jealous rivalries, the report implied, pitted police against police. But so far from identifying potential to be exploited, this story line, it seemed, only stilled a sense of wonder. Which is to say, T&T can expect to hear little or nothing more about ownership of and responsibility for 55 kilogrammes of ganja stashed in a car allegedly under guard by some police. The officers blessed with the tip-off were not inspired to stake out the joint, and await the furtive arrival of claimants to the ganja wonder bag. Civilian second-guessers might have seen in Sea Lots the promise of a \\\"sting\\\" operation to bust drug traffickers and their presumably police collaborators. But the story began and ended there and then, as prematurely as that related story of an unnamed officer defaming identifiable officers in the Stolen Vehicle Unit. And T&T preserved unexpended its sense of wonder for the next jolting episode in the progression of bizarre flashes and incomprehensible out-turns. Ganja seized in the Sea Lots non-bust could be expected to figure in one of the police-beloved photo ops showing officers posed smugly around tables on which drugs and guns, captured like booty, are neatly arrayed. Evidently, nobody, at any level of command in the Police Service, sees this practice of dumb show-and-tell as counter-productively mindless. So it continues, representing unconvincing efforts to portray police as high-achieving performers. The rest of us conclude the cheesy media exposure must be what the beat officers want and need, and we are often loath to begrudge them. Nor are the police really defenceless. \\\"Every time something goes wrong, you call police officers,\\\" said acting Inspector Anand Ramesar, head of the Police Association. \\\"And they continue to be burnt-out.\\\" Ag Insp Ramesar said at a time, earlier this month, when so much seemed to be going wrong, when so often fearful need arose to call the police. But so far from signalling anything like rising to the occasion of greatest law enforcement need, their association chief instead lowered expectations of their \\\"burnt-out\\\" incapacities. By the time the $644 million cocaine cache had been uncovered in Norfolk, bearing a T&T stamp of origin, we here had got the disheartening message that our local police were doing the best they could. If no prospect appeared of raising their game to the challenge level of 1.8 murders a day, the import and export of cargoes of canned cocaine were indisputably beyond their reach. For a long moment, no one appeared manning the captain's bridge of the law enforcement ship. Against Police Service Commission attempts to excoriate him publicly, Acting Commissioner Stephen Williams boasted only of his \\\"thick skin\\\". The law enforcement function was thus prepared for takeover by National Security Minister Gary Griffith. This coincided with the arrival of DEA agents, in the gathering momentum of investigative business left unfinished with the Norfolk bust of T&T-origin cocaine. Mr Griffith began to sound like a man fully armed and empowered to track the drug trafficking beast to its lair, wherever that might be. \\\"Regardless of who it is, or how high it goes,\\\" he said, flexing political muscle never before showed, \\\"I will do all I can to ensure that the persons are brought to justice.\\\" If T&T had needed a sheriff, this suddenly sounded like him. If the sheriff needed a posse, DEA agents, swarming all over, appeared to make up the man-hunting combination of men on horseback. Shortly, Mr Griffith was signalling that the allies\\u2014the T&T Minister and the US DEA agents\\u2014needed no others. In words both fearless and warlike, he said: \\\"We want to ensure that no other ministers in the Cabinet know what we are doing...because we don't want them to tip off someone who might be a friend of these people and then they disappear.\\\" Overnight, the former Army captain had been promoted to Cabinet field marshal, reporting only to the Prime Minister. It had come to that: Kamla Persad-Bissessar was urgently drawing from options in reserve. As T&T, and the rest of the government watched from the gallery, Gary Griffith, with his Yankee supporting cast, had been summoned to save the day. At last, guided once-overs of the T&T crime scene were expected to yield results in a haul of high-end wrongdoers. The big fish, everyone prayed, would meet their match in Big Fisherman Griffith.

Since the 1990 insurrection, there has been an increase in crime and knee-jerk responses from successive governments, according to the Sir David Simmons report on the 1990 attempted coup. It was presented to President Anthony Carmona Thursday and Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar laid it in Parliament following day. In chapter 12 of its report, the Commission made some 31 recommendations aimed at strengthening the national security arms of the country. The following are the recommendations made in the report on the 1990 attempted coup: (1) Re-evaluation of National Security and Intelligence Agencies We respectfully recommend that the entire national security architecture should be revisited. We are mindful that there have been several studies and reports prior to this Commission of Enquiry which, if properly approached and analysed, together with the empirical evidence available from the agencies mentioned above, can produce an appropriate security architecture for Trinidad and Tobago. We are also satisfied that there is no need to import expertise from abroad. There exists in Trinidad and Tobago, a sufficient number of persons, whose knowledge, experience, expertise and sense of patriotism, imbue them with the appropriate credentials to develop a security framework for their country that is relevant to meet the challenges of crime and security effectively. (2) Legislation for National Security Council and Secretariat The National Security Council and Secretariat should be put on a legislative basis to ensure their more effective functioning and to lend authority to their decisions. (3) National Security Operations Centre No National Security Operations Centre existed in 1990. We are of opinion that such a centre, as a focal point for all arms of the security and Intelligence community, would greatly enhance the capability of the State to respond to emergencies. It would provide the ultimate communications platform among the various security agencies and be the agency to issue National Security Alerts when necessary. (4) Rationalisation of SIA, SSA and SAUTT There needs to be rationalisation of entities such as SIA, SSA and SAUTT. One agency should be created from these three. Duplication of effort was evident when these three agencies were in operation. Moreover, the relationship of such agencies to the Police Service needs to be carefully thought out to ensure that there is no duplication of function and effort and that lines of authority and command are clear. The objective should be to establish a symbiotic and collaborative relationship among the agencies. The Commission accepts and supports the view that specific units/entities should be established to target specific types of criminal activity, e.g. drugs and arms trafficking. The Commission also accepts that Intelligence gathering is indispensable to success in the war against crime. Thus, such anticrime structures that are finally developed should have Intelligence-gathering capabilities. But all Intelligence-gathering should be coordinated and shared through the aegis of the Secretariat of the NSC. (5) National Intelligence Superstructure The Commission received strong recommendation that it is necessary to rationalise the disparate agencies which provide Intelligence and consolidate them into one composite authority in the nature of a national security superstructure. This body should have its own staff and a compensation package designed to attract the brightest and best analysts and operatives. The appointment of the Head of this organisation should be made by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister after written consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. This superstructural organisation should, as far as practicable, be comprised of civilians, duly polygraphed and specially trained. Recruitment of personnel from the Military and/or Police should be avoided. Analysts should be assigned to target particular objects of attention, e.g. arms trafficking, drug trafficking and gangs but be cross-trained in the event of unavailability of personnel. The Commission is of the view, however, that the operations and modalities of such an over-arching structure should be carefully thought out to avoid undue bureaucracy, infiltration, corruption and cross-contamination. (6) Heads of Security Meetings The issues of tasking and coordinating within the security structures require attention. The NSC will often only be able to give approval to or guidelines for action or response. Who carries out a particular task and who co-ordinates action or response may become problematic. We recommend that Meetings of Heads of Security should be institutionalised, perhaps convened every two weeks. These Meetings would require the attendance of the Heads of the Protective Services, Customs, Immigration and Prisons. They should be chaired by the Minister of National Security. It is important to involve the Prisons. Indeed, consideration should be given to making the Prisons an Intelligence Cell. Prisoners plan criminal activity from within the confines of a Prison and often disclose information about previous criminal activities during their incarceration. Subcommittees of the Heads of Security can be formulated and tasked to deal with specific issues and then pass information to the requisite executing unit or report back as the situation requires. We are of the view that proper tasking and coordinating are critical to the success of operations. The objective of Heads of Security Meetings is the involvement of every key Intelligence actor on the national stage with key analysts in order to have, at all times, a comprehensive picture of the national situation. (7) Legislation Appropriate legislation should be enacted to govern the operations of any of the entities established to function as security or Intelligence agencies. (8) Direct Action Task Force In respect of operational matters, we recommend the creation of a Direct Action Task Force (DATF) as a first response or first strike unit under the command of the Commissioner of Police. The DATFs role would involve direct intervention in areas or situations of potential or actual criminal activity. (9) Crisis Management Centre and Information Management Centre One of the deficiencies in the security arrangements in 1990 was the absence of a central body to manage the crisis occasioned by the attempted coup. There was also no Central Emergency Plan. The case for a Crisis Management Centre is overwhelming. It is axiomatic that such a Centre should exist. Allied to such a Centre should be an Information Management Centre to coordinate and disseminate information to the media and the public. Were it not for 610 Radio in 1990, the public would have been at an even greater disadvantage than they were in 1990. And the media arrangements at the Holiday Inn hotel left much to be desired. There seemed to have been a reluctance on the part of the local media to make use of the Holiday Inn facility. On the other hand, the foreign media did not appear to have any inhibitions. (10) The Police Service and Law Enforcement Policing crime in Trinidad and Tobago today seems comparable to walking up an escalator going downwards. It seems as though the Police Service is unable to respond to the challenge of contemporary crime effectively. Violent crime seems to be an everyday occurrence. Drugs and guns are at the centre of much of Trinidad and Tobagos crime problem. Crime and the fear of crime have reduced the quality of life for most of the population. Crime is one societal phenomenon about which every individual seems to have his/her own explanation and solution. But there is no single explanation of crime. International criminological evidence still holds to the view that criminality is best explained on the basis of multi-factor theories. If the starting point is that a variety of factors may predispose to crime, then surely the response to crime must be multifaceted. Many of us have our own ideas of what will work to reduce crime. However, the international evidence shows that only a limited number of strategies have proven successful in the fight against crime. (11) Specific Targeted Law Enforcement Strategies So far as law enforcement is concerned, the following have been shown by the Lawrence Sherman Report, Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesnt, Whats Promising, and other studies to actually work in reducing offending: Strengthening the resources of law enforcement agencies; Diversifying Police strategies, for example, by establishing neighbourhood watches; increasing the mobility of the Police; and adopting strategies of community policing and problem-oriented policing. Assisting the public in situational crime prevention through public education; Modernising the administration of justice and the penal system; Continuing research, evaluation and analysis to inform anticrime strategies. The Commission therefore recommends that the resources of the Police Service be strengthened in the following areas, mentioned at (a) to (d) below: (a) Technological Resources The pace of moving from a paper-based system to an electronically-based system should be accelerated. A contemporary state-of-the-art telecommunications system should be installed and contemporary fingerprint, biometric and Intelligence technologies should be acquired. (b) Human Resource Development The Commission is aware that policing is no longer seen as an attractive profession to many of todays youth. But the quality of recruits has to be improved by enhancement of the terms and conditions of Police Officers. Commensurately, however, the entry level for enlistment in the Service is too low; three O-Level passes or their equivalent: If terms and conditions are enhanced, it is probable that enlistment in the Service will be more attractive to a better-educated recruit. Provision should be made to permit the recruitment of an appropriately qualified officer directly at the level of Assistant Superintendent upon condition that the officer undergoes relevant overseas training. (c) Training and Curriculum Change The top management of the Police Service should be exposed to regular training opportunities abroad to bolster professionalism. A state-of-theart Training Institute for Police Officers should be built in Central Trinidad. The curriculum at the Police Training College should be redesigned to lay greater emphasis on training for policing with a heavier concentration on teaching relevant law. The military aspect of police training should be de-emphasised; for example, foot drill and rifle drill. We were told that 60 per cent of a police recruits training is foot drill and military stuff. This should be counterbalanced by more training in the use of side arms and the weapons specific to particular aspects of police work. (d) Mechanical Resources The mobility of the Police Service is a critical factor in proactive and reactive policing. The Government must ensure that the visibility of the police is always high. This requires the provision and availability of vehicles to serve and reassure the public as well as to protect them. (12) Diversification of Police Strategies Community policing has replaced the former nomenclature Resident Beat Officer. Essentially, community policing promotes interaction with communities and seeks to find solutions for problems as defined by the communities. Problem-oriented policing is practised by many police forces in England and the US. The Commission was heartened to learn that the Police Service is actively pursuing these two types of contemporary policing which have been shown to work. No resources should be spared to ensure that these types of policing are seriously and constantly pursued. (13) Encouraging Situational Crime Prevention Criminal activity can be prevented by manipulating the physical environment in order to reduce opportunities to commit crime. This is an approach to crime control that is termed Situational Crime Prevention. One way of achieving this result is by providing the public with information or education about crime prevention methods so that they can work effectively with others in the community. Another method involves the offering of incentives to businesses to encourage the implementation of physical measures designed to curb crime. Properly organised situational crime prevention has been shown to be a most cost-effective method of reducing crime. (14) Continuing Research, Evaluation and Analysis to Inform Anti-Crime Strategies The Police Service should ensure that a Unit of Crime Policy and Analysis, staffed with criminologists and statisticians, develops and uses high quality information, advice and evaluation to assist the Ministry of National Security and criminal justice agencies in preventing and reducing crime. However, because the prevention and reduction of crime are complicated and involve a certain amount of cross-fertilisation, the Crime and Policy Analysis Unit will be obliged to work in conjunction with other Ministries of Government. (15) Deployment of Police Officers The Commission is not in a position to recommend an increase in the personnel of the Police Service. Indeed, too often the cry of the uninformed is Get More Police. The Commission cautions that the first exercise that should be undertaken in considering the optimum strength of the Police Service is to analyse the total security personnel available in Trinidad and Tobago and, thereafter, analyse whether the deployment of such personnel is efficacious or whether better results could not be achieved by different deployment. In any event, the Commission recommends that deployment of Police Officers be constantly kept under review. (16) Anti-Corruption Unit It was represented to the Commission that corruption within the Police Service compromises its effectiveness and contributes to a loss of confidence in the Police Service among the public. The Police Service must put in place strategies and systems to counter corruption. The Commission recommends the establishment of a Unit specifically selected to monitor and investigate corruption within the security agencies generally. THE DEFENCE FORCE (17) Removal from Camp Ogden All witnesses agreed that the Defence Force Headquarters at Camp Ogden are not congruent with the needs of a contemporary Defence Force. We were told that it has long been recognised and accepted that a new location should be found for the Defence Force. Accordingly, we see no value in enumerating the reasons why the Defence Force should be moved from Camp Ogden. Those reasons were advanced to the Commission persuasively and we therefore recommend that the Government take the necessary action to ensure that there is no inordinate delay in causing the Defence Force Headquarters to be relocated. 1990 exposed some of the limitations of Camp Ogden but, 23 years later, Camp Ogden is exactly where it was 23 years before. (18) Legislation Relating to the Military It was represented to the Commission that the legislation relating to the Military is archaic or deficient in many respects. For example, subsidiary legislation to be made under the Defence Act has, in fact, not been made. Thus, the Defence Force is required to use British Manuals of Military Law (Parts I, II and III) to assist in solving problems arising under the Defence Act. There are no Regulations specific to the Army, the Air Wing or the Coast Guard and resort is had to the relevant British Army, Air Force and Navy Regulations. This is wholly inconsistent with an independent Trinidad and Tobago. Where the Defence Act requires the creation of Rules of Procedure, Boards of Enquiry Rules and Detention Rules, none exists. Use is therefore made of the Queens Regulations. The Army Act, 1955 is out of date. No legislative basis exists for enlisting Reservists to lend assistance in times of emergency. When the Defence Force was originally established, the spread and fear of communism were given as the raison dtre for that Force. The threat of communism disappeared in the early 1990s. Todays threats to the security of State are drugs, illegal firearms and international organised crime. The Commission therefore recommends that, having regard to the changed nature of contemporary crime and security issues, there should be an analysis and evaluation of the role and function of the Defence Force to determine whether its role and function should not involve deeper collaboration with the civil power. No comprehensive legislation exists to provide for joint operations between the Military and the Police. It is vital that the circumstances under which, and the manner in which, the Military is empowered to act in aid of the civil power be clearly defined and legislated. (19) Working Party to Modernise Legislation There are a number of retired senior officers and Commanders of the Defence Force who wish to offer their country the benefit of their expertise and experience. Accordingly, the Commission recommends that a Working Party comprising persons such as those mentioned, and assisted by a draftsperson from the Chief Parliamentary Counsels Chambers, be appointed to prepare drafts of amendments to primary legislation and drafts of necessary subsidiary legislation.

Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar yesterday announced a number of crime-fighting measures, following close to three hours of talks with Opposition Leader Dr Keith Rowley and his team. The meeting at the Diplomatic Centre, St Ann's started at around 3.30 p.m. and ended just before 6 p.m. Persad-Bissessar led the Government team of Attorney General Anand Ramlogan, Justice Minister Christlyn Moore, National Diversity Minister Clifton DeCoteau and Legal Affairs Minister Prakash Ramadhar while Rowley was accompanied by Opposition senators Fitzgerald Hinds and Terrence Deyalsingh, and Port of Spain South MP Marlene Mc Donald. The Prime Minister, in a news conference following the meeting, said talks with the Opposition was no \\\"gimmick\\\" and both sides were committed to working together on all fronts to ensure a collaborative and successful approach in the crime fight. \\\"I am committed to working with the Oppostion...to fight what I see as a war, and this war is on crime and criminals,\\\" said Persad-Bissessar. Among the initiatives discussed between the Government and Opposition was the strengthening of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) and the need to devise a new system for the appointment of a commissioner of police. As it stands now, the Police Service Commission (PSC) appoints the CoP based on a system that was introduced under the former People's National Movement (PNM) administration. Teams from the Government and the Opposition will meet again next week to continue discussions on areas raised at yesterday's meeting (See box at right). While the Prime Minister spoke of measures her Government and the Opposition will work on, she announced immediate measures that will be implemented in the crime fight. This includes the establishment of a rapid-response unit. Persad-Bissessar said Government has given Acting CoP Stephen Williams approval to form a rapid-response unit (RRU) and to purchase 300 new vehicles for the Police Service. This unit, she said, will consist of response teams and will be equipped with advanced technological devices to improve police response times to crimes that are in progress. In addition, Persad-Bissessar said officers will be on patrol throughout the length and breadth of the country. She said the teams initially will be focused on the most crime-prone areas, and it was expected the unit will be fully operational before the end of the year. The Prime Minister said special reserve police (SRPs) will undergo specialised training. She said training has already started last June, and the first batch of officers is expected to graduate next month. While there will be more manpower on the roads, there will also be more eyes on the nation as Persad-Bissessar said the CCTV (closed-circuit television) programme will be expanded from November. She said as at this month, 873 cameras were installed in areas, including Beetham Estate, Laventille and Tobago. Proposals are being sent out for central, southern and western areas. There is a note, she said, currently before Cabinet for the Amendment to the Customs Act and VAT Act to remove duties and taxes on the purchase of CCTV cameras. Another crime-fighting initiative is the creation of the Citizen Security Programme (CSP), which is sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank and falls under the portfolio of the Ministry of National Security. Persad-Bissessar said the CSP, which utilises community action as its primary strategy, has been operating in 22 specifically identified communities since 2008. She said Cabinet approval has now been given to extend this programme into communities in East Port of Spain. Persad-Bissessar said social intervention will also be taken, and Cabinet was currently considering a proposal from the Ministry of Gender, Youth and Child Development to increase access to psychosocial counselling and support services for vulnerable children and adolescents in remote and depressed areas. She said plans are also in train to strengthen the capacity of the National Family Services Division of the ministry to better provide and respond to the needs of children and families in all communities. Persad-Bissessar added also that under consideration by Cabinet is the \\\"Gatekeepers\\\" project, which seeks to take a community-based preventative and rehabilitative approach to address the problem of criminality among young males.

The political and economic problems currently being faced by Caribbean countries are extremely worrying. Even in Barbados, which is generally seen as a model nation. The only exception is Trinidad and Tobago, which is not as fiscally challenged as the others. The CLICO problem is, however, strangling the Trinidad economy and the truth is that nobody seems to know for sure what Trinidad's true economic position really is. The information seems to be a closely guarded secret. The political Opposition is alleging that it is just a matter of time before the Government becomes bankrupt because the Government was on a borrowing spree. In the meantime, there are problems in the energy sector. The price of oil is high, but production levels have dropped drastically. What is earned from our sales of LNG is trending upward, but competition with shale-based gas produced in the US is increasing. Notwithstanding the serious nature of the region's economic problems, those posed by narco traffickers and gangs of young black males entrenched in the \\\"garrisons\\\" of Kingston, Laventille, and other so-called hot spots, are doing great damage to the well-being of the region. The Caribbean in general and Jamaica and Trinidad in particular have come to be known as the murder capitals of the world. Rates of gun-, gang- and drug-related crime are embarrassingly high. Both Jamaica and Trinidad recently declared States of Emergency. St Lucia almost did, but was concerned about the likely negative impact of doing so on its tourist-based economy. Jamaica declared a State of Emergency in May 2010 to deal with the threat to its integrity as a sovereign state. As many as 73 people were killed during the confrontation between the police and criminal elements based in Tivoli Gardens. Six of those killed were members of the security services. In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was also imposed in August 2011. No lives were lost, but considerable damage was done to the economy, especially in the service sector. Several small and medium-sized firms were negatively affected. In both cases, many young black males were arrested and charged by the police authorities. There is, at present, much debate in both countries as to whether the State of Emergency has made any sustainable impact on the crime statistics. The security establishment in Jamaica believes the State of Emergency has destabilised the gangs and rates of homicide have dropped significantly. The police and the politicians have claimed the gangs are on the run and the sacrifices made were worthwhile. The homicide rate has dropped by 30 to 40 per cent and is continuing to trend downward. The Commissioner of Police recently declared \\\"victory\\\". As he boasted, \\\"You will observe the dramatic change in the crime and security environment when certain criminal actors meet their demise or are removed from the streets... Matthews Lane is a changed place without Donald Zeeks Phipps; the entire downtown Kingston is changing for the better after decades following the removal of actors such as Puggu of South Side, Christopher 'Dudus' Coke, his brother, Leighton (Livity) Coke of Kingston West, Rooxie of Rose Town, Machine Man of South St Andrew, Donovan 'Bulbie' Bennet and Tesha Miller of Spanish Town, Orane Baldie of Newlands , Eldon Calvert and Doggie, Montego Bay, Joel Andem and lately 'Dog Paw', and several others.\\\" Gang leaders with colourful names are being targeted with all deliberate force. Lawyers and specialists are also being recruited to assist the police in building cases against the \\\"dirty dozens\\\". The resources of the police and intelligence community are also being strategically enhanced. As the Commissioner declared, \\\"Let us not let up the pressure on the criminals and allow them to creep back into our communities.\\\" Most Jamaicans seem to believe Jamaica has turned a corner and the State of Emergency was the \\\"tipping point\\\". One view holds that the gangsters have come to respect the firepower which was on display during the State of Emergency. They also believe the gangsters have come to believe that if President \\\"Dudus\\\" could be vanquished, their own chances of survival were less than good. The Jamaican Constabulary Force (JCF) also seems to be taking corruption within its ranks very seriously. Sixty-four people were arrested by the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) of the JCF between January and September 2011 for breaches of the Corruption Prevention Act. Forty were policemen. Sixty-two policemen were also not permitted to re-enlist, while another seven were dismissed. The ACB Commissioner, who incidentally is an Irishman, boasted that \\\"the efforts of the constabulary to cleanse the force were not falling on deaf ears\\\". We note that Jamaica now hires policemen on contract. Their performance is reviewed at the end of five years. If they are proven to be unsuitable after probation, they may be fired without reference to the Police Service Commission. Trinidad and Tobago is also stepping up its \\\"War\\\" against the criminal elements. It introduced a draconian anti-gang law which however proved to be ineffective because of flaws in the legislation and forensic missteps of the police. Most of the young men who were arrested and charged had to be released, and are suing the State for wrongful arrest. Interestingly, the DPP, the official responsible for deciding whether the State would prosecute those charged, felt the need to advise the police that before making arrests, they should ensure certain steps were taken to ensure likely conviction. The police were advised that they should closely study gang dynamics and group criminal behaviour, develop gang databases, employ informants, effect cooperation rather than competition among law-enforcement agencies and ensure there is preparation by law-enforcement agencies before cases are brought before magistrates. The DPP complained that the police were overzealous in the actions they took, with the result that of the 463 people who were arrested for various offences, some 236 people had to be set free because there was a lack of evidence or no evidence against them. The homicide rate, however, dropped by 66 per cent. The Police Service has pledged to improve its crime-fighting capability and, like the JDF, has expressed its determination to ensure there is no return to the levels of crime that led it to declare a State of Emergency. As a police spokesperson promised, \\\"We will never go back to the lawlessness experienced in the pre-State of Emergency period. Various gangs have been dismantled and police have gained a great deal of intelligence on gang activity.\\\" Unlike Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago has fiscal resources and the Prime Minister has pledged to create 20,000 jobs costing some TT$300 million to help alleviate joblessness. The programme is titled Reclaiming our Youth; Embracing our Future. Ironically, it is the Opposition People's National Movement which has come out against the programme, which is being dismissed as a \\\"quick fix\\\" and a \\\"handout\\\". Time will tell whether the programme would have any positive and sustained impact on the at-risk communities, or whether it would lead to discord and new turf wars. However the initiative turns out, it is clearly an attempt to maintain the crime reduction momentum generated by the State of Emergency and the curfew, as Jamaica is also trying to do. Much is at stake politically. Parties in both countries have staked their fortunes on the sustained outcome of this epic war. The former prime minister, Patrick Manning, who is vainly hoping to be returned to power, has argued that the State of Emergency has had no visible impact on crime. In his view, the Government has played its last card and has no option but to call fresh general elections. The new Jamaican Prime Minister also seems to be benefitting from the upswing.

At right is Mark Deyal, third from right is Yannick Ottley and at left is Adrian Barath. \\u0097Photo: ROGER SEEPERSAD The dragnet that on Sunday descended upon crime-troubled blocks in east Port of Spain conveyed a reassuring message of willingness to take bold initiatives. The motivation to take the fight to the criminal enemy signals a welcome fight-back capacity in an area where murderers, drug and arms traffickers and, now, home invaders, have appeared to hold the upper hand. A force of 300 police and soldiers locked down parts of Duncan, George and Nelson Streets. The exercise facilitated house-to-house searches for guns, ammunition, drugs and related suspects. By the end of the exercise, 90 alleged wrongdoers had been arrested. That the yield of guns and drugs turned out, however, less impressive may reflect the quality of intelligence that guided this search-and-seizure manoeuvre. After last week's multiple murders, the law enforcement forces had to do something. Speaking for that something, Asst Commissioner Glen Hackett described his mission: \\\"We are here to bring a level of confidence to the law-abiding citizens that the police is willing to act on their behalf, where they are perceived to in jeopardy with respect to lawlessness.\\\" The \\\"level of confidence\\\" is necessarily undermined, however, by ACP Hackett's disappointing admission that his forces lacked capacity to go the full distance. For an exercise as important politically and otherwise as this one, the police, though drawing upon the Defence Force, still lacked adequate \\\"resources\\\". Herein lies the wake-up-call reminder about what is realistically possible in T&T crime interdiction and suppression. Despite the growing expenditures on law enforcement, \\\"resources\\\"\\u2014human, but also material and technological\\u2014fall painfully short of what is needed. Such \\\"resources\\\" must indeed be assessed in terms both of quantity and quality. Little or nothing shows for the investment, both by the now-defunct SAUTT, and by successor units, in deriving actionable intelligence about gangs. Not having been busted while SAUTT, with its costly and eye-catching resources, was in operation, the gangs have survived to threaten life and depress livability in east Port of Spain and elsewhere. The People's Partnership administration, with opposition backing, had passed legislation to facilitate the crackdown on gangs. As given effect during the 2011 state of emergency, however, such legislation turned out far from equal to the task of effectively attacking gangsterism. The Director of Public Prosecutions proved at the time to be the weak link in any chain of credible gang suppression. Another large round-up has now taken place of criminal suspects in east Port of Spain. The DPP had better be onside this time around. Otherwise, the best efforts of ACP Hackett will have availed nothing more than to confirm that the police, though alive and well, remain as helplessly ineffective as before.

In the latest instance, the Judiciary takes very serious issue with the National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister, Mr Gary Griffith, who was an interviewee in a half-hour long television programme titled Guns, Drugs and Secrets, dealing with the State of Emergency in Trinidad and Tobago, and embedded on the Worldwide Web by Channel Four on Demand for viewing by the international community. Channel Four is described as a public service broadcaster which commands a five per cent share of the British television audience. Accordingly there would have been viewing by millions of persons when the programme was aired by the station. The programme also formed the basis of a story carried in yesterday's edition of the Sunday Express in which Mr Griffith is quoted directly. In the programme, the reporter, Mr Seyi Rhodes, questions Mr Griffith as follows: \\\"It's probably no surprise to you to hear that every person I speak to in Trinidad, when I ask them where the drugs and the guns come from, they tell me that the ports, the customs authorities, the coast guard and the police are a 100 per cent involved in the trafficking of drugs and guns. Why are you not focussing on that\\\" to which Mr Griffith replies: \\\"Every country in the world will have corrupt police officers, will have corrupt persons in the Judiciary, will have corrupt politicians. That is not an avenue to call a State of Emergency. We needed a State of Emergency to stop law abiding citizens of this country from being killed.\\\" Mr Rhodes poses an indirect question further to Mr Griffith: \\\"The State of Emergency is going to be completely ineffective in dealing with that top level crime, but that top level crime is fundamental because once they are in place, and once they stay in place, they can always feed down and there will always be desperate people at the bottom willing to take their money.\\\" One can only assume that the \\\"top level crime\\\" to which Mr Rhodes is alluding embraces those described in Mr Griffith's own words involving \\\"corrupt police officers, corrupt persons in the Judiciary and corrupt politicians.\\\" Mr Griffith nods visibly in agreement to Mr Rhodes' reference to the \\\"top level crime, \\\"even interrupting the interviewer repeatedly with the word \\\"correct,\\\" adding: \\\"And it is not...and it is not a State of Emergency before, during, and after, that is going to stop that. That has to do with the criminal justice system, how did you acquire the assets. So that is legislation.\\\" Mr Rhodes in a follow-up question, asks: \\\"So exactly, do you not think that this sort of thing should have been brought in before you go through a State of Emergency\\\"And Mr Griffith replies: \\\"That is legislation. In your country it took years for that to be implemented. You can't wait years to implement legislation to stop innocent person from being killed on the streets.\\\" Any reasonable person can conclude from Mr Griffith's comments, albeit generalisations, that he believes the Judiciary to be among the establishments, including \\\"the port, the police, and the coast guard\\\" that are corrupt, and tied in with the importation of guns and drugs into Trinidad and Tobago, the subject of the television programme in the context of the need to declare a State of Emergency to deal with the situation. Interestingly, it is not the reporter, but Mr Griffith who, in the interview, introduces the concept of \\\"corrupt persons in the Judiciary\\\" in the same breath with which he speaks of corrupt politicians and police officers to re-inforce his agreement with the State of Emergency. The Judiciary is forced to question, therefore, whether, as National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister, Mr Griffith is in possession of any evidence on persons in the Judiciary which enables him to so confidently and poignantly link them with the importation of drugs and guns in the country in the current scenario of a State of Emergency in Trinidad and Tobago. If not, then the Judiciary also challenges Mr Griffith to justify his statement to the national community relative to any \\\"person in the Judiciary\\\" being implicated in the gun and drug importation business in the history of the Judiciary of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Since the declaration of the State of Emergency, the Judiciary of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, through the Magistracy, has been handling cases as expeditiously as they have been brought to Court, and, in accordance with the law, has been steadfast in the determination of the matters, either on the basis of evidence or lack thereof, in relation to the persons charged. In keeping with the requirements of the Emergency provisions, the Honourable the Chief Justice, quite promptly, set up a Tribunal to review the cases of persons detained under the emergency regulations. It should be noted that since the declaration of the State of Emergency, not a single application has been made to that Tribunal. The Judiciary wishes to state that it will remain rigorous in its role as the guardian of the rights of citizens, whether under a State of Emergency or not, but it also issues the strongest warning to public officials that it will not tolerate their contempt. The Judiciary will also do all in its power to avert the erosion of its independence by any unfounded or reckless statements and/or suggestions such as those made by Mr Griffith in the television programme and which was given further currency in the Express yesterday. The Judiciary continues to assure the citizens of its independence, and that it does not take lightly, nor will it do anything to scuttle, the trust and confidence which they repose in us.

At a time when numerous complaints and allegations were being made against his officers, Philbert vowed that no one would escape the full brunt of the law, including his officers who ran afoul of the law. Heads of other security agencies also echoed Philbert's sentiments and, though the list is quite long, the Express has managed to compile its top seven matters involving law enforcement officers who are before the courts charged with a series of offences, ranging from rape, robbery, possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and murder. Also included in the count are officers who were cleared of any wrong-doing. Murder Acting Inspector Neil Warner-Paul stood before Magistrate Debra Quintyne in the Arima Magistrates' Court charged with the August 31 murder of Brian Pierre at La Chance Lane, Malabar, Arima. Warner-Paul, who is the secretary of the Police Social and Welfare Association, allegedly shot Pierre following an altercation. His matter has been adjourned on several occasions and is expected to start early next year. Rape Three police officers and a soldier attached to the T&T Defence Force each appeared in court on separate occasions charged with rape and other sexual offences. Constable Stephen Jerome, who has 15 years' service, is alleged to have raped a 35-year-old United States citizen at the Arouca Police Station on May 4. Jerome, 36, of Paradise East, Dinsley Village, Tacarigua, was placed on $75,000 bail by Magistrate Margaret Alert. He also consented to a DNA test. On June 16, Vishan Ragoo appeared before a Couva magistrate charged with raping a teenager, two counts of grievous sexual assault and one count of common assault. Ragoo, 28, is attached to the Chaguanas Criminal Investigations Department. The incidents are alleged to have occurred during the period February 4 and June 12 at a house in McBean, Couva. Constable Derrick Badree, who is attached to the Couva Police Station, was granted $100,000 bail after it was alleged he had raped a Colombian hotel worker on November 16. Badree, 38, has 11 years' service and was also charged with grievous assault and common assault. Private Taradath Bridgemohan appeared before a Port of Spain magistrate on May 7, charged with grievous sexual assault against a 25-year-old woman. He was placed on $80,000 bail. The incident is alleged to have occurred on March 19, on the compound of Camp Ogden. Illegal possession of arms and ammuni- tion Over half a million dollars in bail was granted to several law enforcement officers charged with possession of arms and ammunition. The majority of that bail was granted to soldiers. On November 20, Private Andre Logan, who is attached to Camp Ogden, was charged by detectives of the Organised Crime, Narcotics and Firearms Bureau with possession of a 9mm pistol. He was granted $60,000 bail by Magistrate Maria Busby Earle-Caddle. Able Seaman Nikolai Constaste, 27, of the T&T Coast Guard, was charged with seven offences, including possession of a firearm (Smith and Wesson 9mm hand pistol) with intent to endanger life and ammo (13 rounds of 9mm ammo), common assault of two police officers (PCs Barry Alleyne and Cylan Gillard) and stealing a firearm. The charges stemmed from an incident which occurred on November 4 at the Diego Martin Main Road. He was granted $250,000 bail by Magistrate Avason Quinlan. Constable Daniel Deoraj, of the Central Police Station, was granted $200,000 bail by Port of Spain Magistrate Brian Dabideen. Deoraj was charged with possession of ammunition, a Smith and Wesson firearm, possession of drugs, and fraud. It is alleged that on October 20, Deoraj, 32, accepted $1,000 from Cecilia George at FCB on Park Street, Port of Spain, as an inducement to forgo a criminal charge. He has 26 years' service. Privates Jefferson Nimblett and Wenrick Hernandez, of the T&T Defence Force, appeared in court on September 2, charged with possession of a Glock 9mm semi automatic pistol and 17 rounds of ammunition. They were held during a police exercise on August 29 at Warren Street, St Augustine. The officers were subsequently granted $75,000 bail. On March 13, Private Gary John was charged with possession of an illegal firearm and three counts of robbery. He was denied bail when he first appeared in court. Soldiers Clint Caprietta and Aaron John were charged with possession of 296 rounds of 5.56 ammunition.They were arrested during a roadblock on January 27 on the Priority Bus Route by officers of the Highway Patrol in Arima. Vindication Inquests played a pivotal role in the dismissal of cases of alleged wrong-doing against several police officers. PC Curtis Frith and WPC Camini Baijoo, of the Western Division Task Force, were cleared on February 18 by coroner Brambhana Dubay in the shooting death of Sherman Monsegue On May 23, Magistrate Gail Gonzales cleared nine police officers of any crimes related to the shooting death of Kathy-ann Sinclair. Sinclair was shot dead in March 1998 at Trestrail Rancho Caballero Farm in D'abadie. The officers cleared were Insp White, Cpl Ramjohn and PCs Greene, Black,Alvarez, Rampersad, Murray, Lackhai and Williams. Cpl Liston Taylor and PC Alan Norton were cleared by coroner Chief Magistrate Sherman McNicolls in the April 5, 2007, shooting death of Morvant resident Joel Charles. Charles, 22, was hit by a stray bullet after it was alleged the officers, Taylor and Norton, fired into a crowd. Coroner Cheron Raphael ruled on July 31 that PCs Joel Barton and David Martin were innocent of any wrong-doing in the January 27, 2004, shooting death of Sterling Pompey. Pompey, of Upper Covigne Road, Diego Martin, was being sought by police on several outstanding warrants. Officers of the Western Division had gone to arrest him on Quarry Street, Laventille, when they claimed Pompey fired at them. The officers returned fire and Pompey was shot dead. Constable Anthony Sylvester, who was charged with murdering Morvant resident Sheldon DesVignes, was subsequently discharged on February 27 by McNicolls, after there was conflicting evidence from eyewitnesses into the shooting. Perverting the course of justice Traffic Branch officer Cpl Adolphous O'Neil appeared before a Port of Spain magistrate on February 28, charged with assaulting two garbage collectors. O'Neil appeared before Magistrate Ejenny Espinet charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice and assault. He was arrested and charged by officers of the Anti Corruption Investigation Bureau. It is alleged that O'Neil assaulted both Aladdin Alexander and Reynold Majeed on August 26 at Bay Road, Couva, last year. He was placed on $40,000 bail to cover all charges. Constables Rajoo Katwaroo, of the Point Fortin Police Station, and Devon Scotland, of the Santa Flora Police Station, appeared in court on July 10, charged with perverting the course of justice. The officers pleaded not guilty and were granted $75,000 bail. The charge alleged that Katwaroo and Scotland attempted to conceal details of a car accident involving a car that was not insured. The incident is said to have occurred on June 22,2005. Motor Manslaughter Private Dario Pran,19, of Dinsley Road, Tacarigua, a Defence Force soldier, appeared in the Port of Spain Magistrates' Court before Magistrate Gillian David charged with dangerous driving, resulting in the death of Private Sean Martin on October 12. Pran was also charged with using the Priority Bus Route without authorisation. He was granted $75,000 bail. Larceny/Fraud Acting Cpl Choylin Salvary and WPC Stacy Moore appeared in court on June 16, where it was alleged that the T&T Police Service Finance Branch requested and authorised them to order and receive cell phones from TSTT. The value of the phones amounted to $30,629.50. On May 8, Cpl Bobby Noyan and PCs Vijay Balkissoon and Marlon Thomas, of the Chaguanas Police Station, appeared before a Couva magistrate charged with a $300 robbery during an incident at the Couva Police Station on November 23, 2006. On January 24, special reserve policeman Wendell Constantine was committed to stand trial at the sitting of the next Assizes. Constantine is alleged to have stolen a Browning semi-automatic .38 pistol and 25 rounds of ammunition during his shift at the Central Police Station, St Vincent Street, Port of Spain, on October 26, 2006. The gun is valued at $2400, while the bullets cost a total of $28. Constantine was arrested by ASP Joanne James and charged with \\\"larceny by servant'' (when an employee steals from his employer). He is on $100,000 bail. Also, on January 29, Constable Garvin Peterson, 28, was committed to stand trial after being charged with stealing a 9mm semi-automatic pistol and 13 rounds of ammo from the St James Police Station. He was committed by Magistrate Avason Quinlan and granted $150,000 bail.

The vehicle in which Rupert Thomas was traveling when he crashed and died in San Fernando on Monday night. DOES crime really surprise you If the Prime Ministers National Security Council intelligentsia had no knowledge of an illegal police unit operating that close to the State prison and international airport, how can it defend the streets, coastline and high seas, and battle cartels and crooked politicians As we plunge into another round of hand-wringing over crime, the great debate is upon us. Who to blame This time, its about a high-flying political squad, clearly brought down to earth by the weight of over-promise and under-delivery, and a severely deluded new Flying Squad exposed before lift-off. The solution: the PM commands a photo opportunity, flanked by the embattled Minister Warner and the loyal Minister Moonilal, with national security bosses in the frame. As she has done twice before, the PM has used the recent spike in murders, and the alleged Flying Squad revival, to take another shot at Warner. In June 2011, she halved Warners Ministry of Works and Transport, parcelling off the transport responsibilities to another minister. Then, in August 2011, the PM took the still-controversial highway project from Warner, and put it under an inter-ministerial committee stacked with her loyalists. Now, the PM has used her position as head of the National Security Council to send a message to the public and opposition politicians The buck stops here. Maybe she can add the words, I think. In this combined shot at Warner and crime, the PM will confront any thought of an elite unit battling pervasive crime. Before that, she must confront the fact that since the old Flying Squad was so maligned, how did this new Flying Squad get so close to take-off. Any attraction to some sort of special squad is rooted in our abuse of the word elite, and our penchant for enclaves, cliques, cartels, tribes, and carve-outs. Our version of elitism is not about excellence and best-in-class. It is about untouchables, and in the case of the Flying Squad, our disregard for growing evidence in the 1980s that behind the headlines of achievement, the Flying Squad was destroying the psyche of the Police Service. That Police Service should have destroyed the lucrative marijuana trade, and the early development of the transnational trade in cocaine and arms. Instead, rogue officers took root and stayed put, and so did the crime. A 2011 report by the US Institute of Peace notes that one of two trends in the reporting of police corruption globally is that drug involvement is not mentioned before 1970. After 1970, drugs became the major driver of corruption. As it turned out, the 1987 Scott Drug Report killed the Flying Squad, finally bringing into full glare the conflicting reports of the squads success, and its deep involvement in criminal activity. In the 1980s the elite title appended to the Flying Squad was just another cause for friction within the Police Service which was already short on opportunities for women, afflicted by the lack of transparency in promotion, and constantly affected by politics. But, the Police Service never recovered from the Flying Squads creation and the fallout from the Scott Drug Report, the service having to deal with the re-absorption of potentially tainted officers into the ranks, and the inevitable distrust which informed public perception. It appeared out of place that serious allegations of police and judicial corruption would be at the core of a report on drug abuse but, that drug connection, identified in 1987, is still responsible for both the current crime problem, and the lack of serious political action. It is therefore a major concern that the idea of any revival of the Flying Squad could actually make it past the national security gatekeepers. Nothing in the squads history, the track record of its proponents, and the public perception of the group, warranted more than Minister Warners polite note of thanks, and rejection. That approach would surely have been consistent with the UNCs attitude towards the Special Anti-Crime Unit (SAUTT), which for most of its own elite life operated without the legitimacy of law. But, then again, even the Partnership has recalibrated its rhetoric on crime. The coalitions 2010 manifesto plays up the idea of tackling the structural problems that facilitate crime, among them alienation from the political process, and the lack of participation and consultation. Now, the Minister of National Security threatens more jail time, more difficult bail conditions, and more guns and boots on the streets. But, whats the value of more jail time if criminals are not arrested and charged, and when they are they are not successfully prosecuted Whats the value of no bail when the bandit factories embedded in most communities provide a steady supply of criminal replacements What is the value of the promise of more police on the streets when officers lack the fundamentals of policing in 2013mental and physical fitness, training, strategy, adequate insurance coverage, and appropriate technology and gear And, whatever the PM does, the fact is that she has to confront the political distrust already created. In her partys 2010 manifesto, the PM promised, My immediate goal will be to introduce greater transparency and accountability in government. That has not happened, and its instructive that the most significant crime stories are ones which have brought the most negative publicity to the Partnership: the Reshmi and Financial Intelligence Unit appointments; Section 34; the choice of Minister Warner for national security; the Offshore Patrol Vessels termination; and, the resignations of the Canadian Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Police just after Warners appointment.

The report provided survey data and responses from seven Caribbean countries\\u2014Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. A key conclusion was that issues surrounding gangs and, in particular, youths are more than a security concern; they are a human development problem which has impacted the Caribbean region. In particular, the CHDR provided statistics that in T&T the sense of security was lowest at 25 per cent, and the perceived confidence in the ability of the Police Service to control gang violence was also the lowest at 9.9 per cent across the countries surveyed. Both reports are particularly relevant to recent concerns centred on gangs and the relative ineffectiveness of a multiplicity of strategies to address crime as a whole. Why have the various crime-fighting strategies against gangs not been working My view is that we have been looking at it from the perspective that gangs are the main cause of crime, as opposed to looking at it from a standpoint that crime causes gangs. Terminologies are coined which promote the long-held view that gangs are predominantly the main cause of crime in T&T. We hear terms such as \\\"gang-related\\\", \\\"gang warfare\\\", \\\"gangsterism\\\" and the like, but little scientific thought has been around the view that crime or pre-existing violent conditions within the communities may cause gang formation. The CHDR referred to a study conducted in T&T during 2010, which found that most youth joined gangs for reasons of friendship (42 per cent), protection or safety (29.4 per cent), a family member was in a gang (5.9 per cent), to make money (eight per cent) or for other reasons (14.7 per cent). This is largely consistent with a data provided in the Ryan report and which stated \\\"gangs seem to form less for criminal activity\\\". If youths join gangs for reasons of protection instead of going to the police authorities, the State can be viewed as having failed in its duty to protect and serve; therefore gangs are formed as a result of the failure of the authorities to protect the rights of these youths. Failures of relevant authorities to detect pre-existing violent conditions and to convict perpetrators of crime can arguably be the main causes leading to gang formation. Pre-existing violent conditions to which I refer are those conditions such as bullying, existence of drug blocks, teen rape, absent fathers, adultery, abuse at home, use of youths as transport for guns and drugs, disrespect and intimidation from adult authorities, among other conditions such as poverty, unemployment, psychological issues and so on. One can surmise from the surveys and logic that gangs are not wholly the cause of crime but predominantly a response to, or a result of, crime. Gangs can be viewed as the result of failed attempts by the Police Service to deal with crime, including corruption, and the failure of the judiciary to adequately provide timely justice. The UNDP Citizen Security Survey 2010 suggested \\\"that judicial corruption is pervasive... the problem appears particularly acute in Trinidad and Tobago\\\". This theory can probably explain why the enforcement of the Anti-Gang Act and crime suppression efforts have not worked thus far. The CHDR noted that \\\"legislation would have only limited impact in suppressing gang membership, gangs or gang activity\\\". The report also stated that in 2006-2007 the Gang/Repeat Offender Task Force made 495 arrests in which only 22.2 per cent were charged, and conviction was even less. Under the state of emergency in 2011, a majority of those held were also released. It comes as no surprise that 59 of the 90 people held last Sunday from East Port of Spain were also released. The Anti-Gang Act and forced crime suppression measures will be ineffective unless detection rates to unearth crimes improve significantly as well as conviction rates. Perhaps a quote from the CHDR is appropriate, \\\"an open ear is more powerful than an iron fist\\\". While there may be short-term relief for citizens, the gang problem will likely worsen because white-collar crime, violence against youths, a weak judiciary and lack of capacity of the Police Service to deal with the burgeoning crime situation is not being addressed adequately. The analysis must shift from the view that gangs cause violent crime to the real possibility that crime causes gangs. An even larger problem is a lack of preservation of rights and justice for the entire population. The State and law enforcement institutions have a responsibility to protect the naturally given rights of life, liberty and property of every citizen, including the youths. What strategies the State pursues to two altogether different types of gang members (those forced and those bent on living a life of crime) can be answered by considering and implementing some of the strategies recommended in these reports over the short and long term to which I have referred. \\u2022 Anand Heeraman is a certified fraud examiner, doctoral candidate in political economy and works regionally and internationally.

The Special Anti-Crime Unit (SAUTT) is currently in its sixth year of operations and continues to focus on three main areas. i. strengthening national forensic capabilities; ii. providing developmental training for law enforcement; iii. lending operational support to the Police Service and other law enforcement agencies. The Specialist Crime Academy To date, over 500 SAUTT Officers have received training in areas such as Crime Scene Investigation, Forensic Awareness and DNA, Investigative Interviewing and more. The Crime and Problem Analysis (CAPA) Unit was established in 2007 and continues to improve the capacity of the Police Service to gather accurate and timely information on crime and undertake in-depth analysis. Gang Violence and Activity. An international Comprehensive Gang Model has been applied, leading to computerised information systems and improved analysis and mapping procedures; and to the establishment of a Repeat Offenders Programme Task Force (ROPTF), responsible for identifying street gangs, their membership structures and turf. The Forensic Science Centre continues to play a significant role. Of critical importance is the installation of a modern DNA Laboratory, adding this state of the art methodology to our crime-fighting capacity. New Fire Stations. To provide effective fire fighting and emergency service to new communities, new fire stations were constructed at Piarco, Sangre Grange and Couva South. The functional requirements of 12 other stations are being finalised in order to commence construction. New Police Stations. Over the last two years, police presence has been much enhanced by the construction of 5 Police Stations and 3 Police Posts. Moreover, 19 new Stations are scheduled for communities throughout Trinidad and Tobago. The Introduction of an Integrated Border Management System is equipping nationals with travel documents that reduce exposure to identity and passport fraud. Machine Readable Passports have been introduced to ensure hassle free travel. To date over 350,000 citizens have been issued with new Machine Readable Passports. The waiting time for a new passport has been reduced to 12 working days. Disaster Management The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management has provided training to relevant partners in such areas as: Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis, Shelter Management, Medical Response, Mass Casualty Management, and Search and Rescue. Its public education campaign continues to sensitize the population on necessary measures in the event of an emergency or disaster. Dealing with Illegal Drugs and Guns The PNM Government recognises that a major concern of our citizens is the levels of crime and violence plaguing our country. But we also need to understand its causes. Our location has made us a trans-shipment point for illegal drugs between the supplier countries of South America and the consuming countries of North America and Europe. To address and eliminate this problem, the PNM Government has taken the necessary steps to stem the flow of drugs and guns into our country, in particular with the acquisition of the following Coast Guard vessels over the last 2 years: 6 30-metre Fast Patrol Craft with speeds of over 40 knots; 2 46-metre Coastal Patrol Vessels; and 14 Fast Interceptor Craft with speeds of up to 50 knots This brings the total complement of armed Coast Guard vessels to 28, a 300% increase from when we assumed office in 2001. Now, we can match the speed and manoeuvrability of virtually any vessel that operates illegally in our waters. This is by far the most significant expansion/upgrade in history of the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard. And that is not all. The final pieces in our naval arsenal will be the three 3 No. 90-metre Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) which we have acquired through a Government-to-Government arrangement with the United Kingdom. These vessels each have the capability to carry over 100 men and stay out at sea for several weeks, with a range of several thousand miles. When they are commissioned and put into service, together with our other military vessels and the armed helicopters that are now in production, these sophisticated military vessels will make Trinidad and Tobago virtually impenetrable to drug traffickers. The first of these OPVs is already undergoing sea trials in the UK and is due to arrive in Trinidad and Tobago in September 2010. OPV 2 is and scheduled to arrive in mid November 2010, and OPV 3 in March 2011. Further, for the first time in our nation's history, we can now deploy our naval assets based on the 360-degree radar system coverage. Our investment in the Coast Guard has already begun to disrupt the drug flow into the country. For the first quarter of this year 2010 alone, 1,650 kilos of marijuana and 35 kilos of cocaine have been seized, and another 2,750 kilos of dumped marijuana recovered. The war against illegal drugs and guns will continue in our next term. It represents a major strike against crime in this country.

It is our understanding that this work was funded by your Organisation. Representatives of the Ministry of National Security met with Mr Townsend and explained to him in detail the crime situation and the challenges associated with fighting crime in Trinidad and Tobago. The hope was that this Paper would have provided its readers with an accurate and objective review on the challenges facing this nation. However, judging from the report, it is apparent that Mr Townsend was more interested in compiling and rehashing salacious matters that have appeared in various media. So troubling was this report that WINAD, a well-respected NGO, issued a press release that said in part: \\\"The content of the report reveals a need for several inaccuracies to be clarified. The fundamental argument of the report relied heavily on newspaper reports and consequently, regurgitated accusations which have fuelled public debate on the effectiveness of the State's response to the challenge of armed violence. Throughout it all, there is the absence of clinical analysis. This report would have been more useful had it focused more rigorously on the root elements of the challenge of guns, gangs and governance in Trinidad and Tobago by exploring the historical antecedents; structural violence; human rights violations; and the gendered nature of the challenge. Had it done so, it would have presented an opportunity for citizens, including policy makers, to reflect on the many and varied responses which have been designed to respond and counteract violent crime, especially armed violence, and evaluate the impact and usefulness. Further, it is imperative that persons in the various sectors desist from making inflammatory statements in relation to armed violence since this serves only to exacerbate an already volatile situation and place barriers to non-partisan dialogue on fact finding and solutions.\\\" Likewise, independent Senator and Professor Ramesh Deosaran categorically distanced himself from the report and is quoted as saying: \\\"I myself had no part in providing such information. I remember when the person who presumed to be the author of this report came into my office. I don't think I was able to meet with him or provide information that would cause a report to be written in such a way, which to some extent does unnecessary damage to this country.\\\" Professor Deosaran went on to say that this is not the first time Trinidad and Tobago has been subjected to such a negative report and he questioned the credibility of the author and publishing company. The Ministry of National Security also issued a media statement, dated January 8th 2010 on the matter. It reads: The Ministry of National Security has noted the Small Arms Survey working paper 'No Other Life Gangs, Guns, and Governance in Trinidad and Tobago' and the comments that have appeared in the media on the issue. The Ministry is of the view that the Report brings together a compilation of unsubstantiated media reports, and opinions, to paint an unnecessarily negative picture of Trinidad and Tobago that is not in keeping with the facts of life in our twin-island Republic. The author's suggestion that there is \\\"no other life\\\" but gang and guns in some of the at-risk communities is indeed unfortunate and does a disservice to the many hard working and law-abiding citizens in these communities. The Ministry is mindful of the fact that the Report is a 'research paper' which sought to prove its thesis in a partially informed manner, so much so, that some of those whose works are quoted in the Report are distancing themselves from it. Crime is too complex an issue to draw conclusions based only on statistics relating to murder and arrests. There are serious sociological and historical factors that need to be taken into account, for an in-depth understanding to be achieved. Unfortunately, this is not the case in this paper. \\\" Over the past nine years this Government has invested heavily to improve law enforcement. The Police Service transformation programme is now in its sixth year and is beginning to see the benefit of intelligence-led and problem-oriented policing. The Police Academy is now led by an experienced Provost who is further modernising the curriculum and instituting a modern in-service professional training programme for officers. The physical infrastructure of the Police Academy is being refurbished and new structures are being added. To increase Police visibility and presence, the Government has purchased no less than 1,200 vehicles in the past five years. Additionally, a modern CCTV network is now aiding Police in their day-to-day operations. Given that Trinidad and Tobago is a transhipment point; our naval assets have been increased substantially in the last year. The Coast Guard now has twelve new fast interceptor craft, six fast patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. Additionally, the Custom and Excise Division has seven fast interceptor craft. To support interdiction operations the Government has modified the two fixed wing C26 craft with modern forward looking infrared radar and long range cameras. There are now three helicopters and an airship all equipped with modern surveillance systems to support land and maritime operations. Trinidad and Tobago's fight against drugs is also part of a wider programme that involves the participation of regional and international partners. The Government's effort in the fight against international drug trafficking is clearly acknowledged in the United States State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report released on 1 March 2010. It should be noted that when Mr Townsend met with Ministry officials he indicated that there would be an opportunity to comment on the report. Instead, a link was sent to the Ministry on 20 December, mere days before the release of the document. This was not in keeping with the spirit of a good-faith agreement. Your organisation has given Mr Townsend legitimacy through the aforementioned Working Paper. The legitimacy gained is now being used to pillory the Government and by extension this nation in a most negative light. You or any of your chosen representatives are invited to visit Trinidad and Tobago to see the situation firsthand. As a Government which has and continues to invest valuable taxpayers' funds to ensure that our law enforcement and military has all the requisite resources to fight all aspects of crime, it is indeed disconcerting to have a prestigious organisation such as yours be the sponsor of such a malicious report on Trinidad and Tobago. This Government is confident that we can improve the current crime situation and provide our citizens with a level of security and safety that is commensurate with the country's economic development. We will continue to work closely with all sectors of society and our international partners to ensure that our goals of a safe and secure society are achieved. Respectfully, Martin R.

The police, more than the politicians, form the thin blue line that is supposed to stop the criminals from overwhelming the law-abiding population. It is what they are paid to do, although you would think otherwise when you encounter elements in the service who believe their uniforms empower them to abuse the citizenry, who embody that difficult-to-define Trini trait \\u2014 \\u201choggish\\u201d. But whatever their faults, they are not, and cannot be, the first line of defence against crime and criminals. Let me explain my reasoning. If there were no crime, no criminals or lawbreakers, would we need the police I think not. I don't want to get into a philosophical debate on crime and criminality, or a religious argument about sin being an intrinsic part of human existence. I simply argue that if the entire society comprised only law-abiding citizens who treated each other with respect, who adhered to moral principles and ethical standards, then there would be no crime, hence no need for the police or prisons or the judiciary. Such utopia does not exist, however. Crime is universal and criminality is a dominant feature of societies such as ours. As so many scribes and crusaders against crime have noted, human beings are not born criminals. Sometime between birth and maturity, something or things happen that alter the minds, the values, the behaviour of certain people, stripping them of their conscience, which is the key to their entering the netherworld of crime. These changes occur in their homes, in their communities, in the environment in which they are nurtured in their formative years. Let me make it clear that while most of the criminals we get to know come from depressed districts, the shaping of the criminal mind, the stripping of the conscience that eventually leads to callous disregard for human lives, straddles societal stratifications. We are conditioned to focus on the bandits and heartless murderers who emerge from the slums, punks who believe that society owes them a living, nay, a lifestyle of \\u201cbling\\u201d and consumerism that they will grab by the barrel of a gun. Justifiably, we condemn the parents and communities that mass-produce these murderers, that grant them immunity from the already amputated arm of the law. Case in point: the men who murdered a WASA worker on the Powder Magazine compound in Cocorite last week are known to many residents there\\u2014of that I am certain. But they won't give such information to the police (who may also know their identities). A few are fearful for their lives. Most don't give a damn. It matters not that an innocent worker lost his life, that they are harbouring a killer or ten who will likely strike again and again. But you know what WASA workers can strike back by refusing to service the complex, by creating a stoppage that will render Powder Magazine dry and stink and let it stay that way until the community hands over every criminal, not just one murderer. T&TEC, TSTT and cable television companies whose employees have been similarly targeted in other \\u201chot spots\\u201d can do likewise, exact retribution, force such dens to purge the criminal elements or suffer a boycott of essential services. Harsh, you say Yes. Illegal That, too. Innocent paying for the guilty They always do. As a veteran protester from the 1970s when we would target the root sources of the different issues with vocal- and placard-force, I am not impressed with powder puff protests in St Clair and similar enclaves. They achieve nothing other than assuage the guilt-by-indifference of a few people. If you must protest in such upscale districts, target the residences of the other criminal classes\\u2014the importers of arms, ammunition and drugs, the price gougers, the banker-bandits, the medical and legal mafia, contractors and politicians who plunder the Treasury\\u2026need I name more Don't mourn crime victims; organise, in large numbers, lay siege to the dens of crime across the country, in fact, shut down the damn country, everything\\u2014utilities, industries, commercial enterprises\\u2014and do not reopen it until the guns are surrendered and the criminals are behind bars\\u2014no-collar, blue-collar, white-collar, all colours. Sure, many people will suffer, but aren't they suffering now Hell, some leaders might be arrested, jailed, even shot by criminals-in-and-out-of-uniforms. Jail is not that bad\\u2014I've been in the lock-up a few times, for insurrection, for protesting, for picketing. Look, you cannot fight the criminals with powder puffs. You cannot \\u201ctake back the country\\u201d with big speeches or columns like this. This is war, and wars can only be won on the battlefield, on the ground. Did someone ask about my crime plan IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

In doing so, Joseph said, \\\"As law enforcement becomes a little more effective in stopping the inflow of drugs you have greater turf war for what little exists. So you're really between a rock and a hard place.\\\" Joseph made the comments during Thursday's post-Cabinet news conference at the Diplomatic Centre, St Ann's, as he revealed that several new pieces of legislation meant to deal with the intercepting of information, gangs and gun crimes will be brought to the Parliament. The new legislations include an Official Secrecy Act which is scheduled to be submitted before the National Security Council for its consideration by the end of this month. Joseph's statements came as he responded to a questions relating to the murder of 10-year-old Tecia Henry and the rising homicide tally which increases almost daily despite the Government's and law enforcement's efforts to curb it. Joseph said as of June 17, there were 258 homicides as compared to 237 for the same period last year and 130 for the same period in 2007. He said law enforcement \\\"will continue to do what they can in terms of moving again on intelligence led type policing\\\" and added that this approach \\\"was able to provide the police with certain types of information\\\" regarding their investigations into Henry's abduction and murder, as he defended use of the multi-million dollar airship (blimp) and the more than 400 State-operated close circuit television cameras acquired by the Government to monitor areas across the country. \\\"I would be out of place to tell you what information but I can assure you...that some of the very same intelligence devices are assisting the police in their investigations,\\\" Joseph said. Although, Henry's case has not been identified as a sex crime, Joseph was asked about the implementation of child predator laws to protect children. He said \\\"the whole question of identifying predators who are living in communities\\\" is now being \\\"actively considered\\\" by the Government.

Maharaj, in 2007, opposed the selection of a colleague to lead an investigation of alleged by the police, claiming the Service to be too corrupt for objectivity and justice to be served. \\\"At the time, Maharaj claimed that the force was massively corrupt including playing a leading role in the nation's drug trade,\\\" Townsend said, referencing an article from the Trinidad Express. Townsend also mentioned that at the time of his public stance against what he called corruption that reached all the way to the top, Maharaj had been seeking permission to obtain a firearm for protection.

A Coast Guard cutter and a specialised pursuit boat were dispatched from Puerto Rico to intercept the speedboat. Before dawn had broken, the coastguardsmen boarded and found more than a tonne of cocaine, with a wholesale value of more than US$34 million. The Coast Guard was thrilled at the haul, hailing the \\\"complex and dangerous operation\\\" undertaken in the dead of night. But it was a rare triumph. US and regional law enforcement agencies have been struggling to stem a resurgent tide of drugs flowing through the Caribbean. After a relatively calm two decades, during which Mexico emerged as the dominant smuggling point for trafficking drugs into the US, local and international officials say the Caribbean is once again becoming an important transit route, as cartels take advantage of the region's economic problems. Criminals are reactivating old operations in the archipelago or beefing up existing ones in places such as the Dominican Republic. The US Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates that 14 per cent of all cocaine smuggled into the US in the first half of the year came via the Caribbean\\u2014twice the rate of 2012. \\\"It's acute when you consider that the overall flow [into the US] is down,\\\" says Vito Guarino, DEA special agent in charge of Caribbean operations. It is still a far cry from the 1980s, when up to 75 per cent of the cocaine seized between South America and the US was taken in the Caribbean, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The unremitting flow of cocaine into Florida in particular inspired cultural touchstones like the movie Scarface and Miami Vice, the US television series. But the recent surge still worries US and Caribbean officials, who fear the region is acutely vulnerable to traffickers. Many countries are trying to cope with a protracted economic downturn and mounting debts, which are forcing governments to hack away at budgets and pushing up unemployment. \\\"You're unemployed and starving, and someone offers you $1,000 to take a go-fast boat full of drugs to the US. What would we do in this situation\\\" Guarino says. The region is also paying the price of successes elsewhere. Analysts say one of the big reasons why cartels are re-establishing themselves in the Caribbean is the clear security improvement in Mexico. As police \\\"squeeze the narco balloon\\\" there, it swells in the tropical islands to the east, according to Daniel Sachs, a Mexico-based analyst at Control Risks, a consultancy. The impact is invidious. Cartels frequently ally themselves with local gangs on islands like Trinidad, paying for protection and smuggling services with guns and drugs. That feeds domestic drug abuse and exacerbates already high crime rates, as heavily armed local gangs fight for lucrative turf and cartel contracts. These gangs are the cause of the region's extreme murder rates, argues Owen Ellington, head of Jamaica's police force. Moreover, drug money can buy many friends in a region, where even an army general or senior police officer will often make only a few thousand dollars a month, and political donations and spending usually go unreported, activists and diplomats say. Security officials say the Dominican Republic is the main transshipment point for drugs bound for the US and Europe, due to the cultural and linguistic ties with the cocaine-producing countries in South and Central America. However, smaller statelets like St Kitts and Nevis, which simply cannot afford to defend their coasts, are the ones that have arguably suffered the most from the increase in trafficking. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, estimates about half his country's murders are directly tied to the drug trade. \\\"The bulk of the drugs is for the US and European markets, but [the traffickers] bring guns with them,\\\" he complains. US and international officials are keenly aware of the resurgent danger, and have launched a number of programmes in response. The US government established a Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) in 2009 to provide countries with technical assistance, equipment and training to combat crime and drug smuggling. This includes setting up detection-dog units, improving prisons, providing cargo scanners, polygraphs and interceptor boats, and sharing more information with local security forces. The CBSI has spent US$263 million on various initiatives since it was established in 2009, according to the US state department. Local politicians say it has helped to improve their capabilities, but argue it is trifling compared with the scale of the problem.\\\"The resources deployed under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative can be described as a drop in the bucket,\\\" said Barbados Prime Minister Freundel Stuart. Optimism is in short supply. Even if the US and regional law enforcement succeed in staunching the drug flow, this could paradoxically lead to an increase in violence, as local gangs and cartels fight over a smaller pie, notes Amado de Andrs, the UNODC's regional representative. He points out that bloodshed in Jamaica increased dramatically even as it became a less important transit point for cocaine in the 1990s. Mexico has seen a similar trend more recently. In many countries, there appears to be resignation that drugs trafficking will always be a challenge, and concern the problem will inevitably worsen in the coming years. \\\"We're right in the middle of the world's biggest producer and consumer of drugs,\\\" observes Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican central bank governor and ambassador to the US. \\\"If only they could grow cocaine in the Rocky Mountains,\\\" he sighs. \\u2022 The Financial Times spent two weeks reporting across the Caribbean, travel funded in part by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to explore the impact of the region's economic downturn. \\u2014FT.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

However, Griffith said his comments, which were made during an interview with a foreign journalist, were not aimed at this country's Judiciary as he was speaking on a global context. \\\"At no time did I mean to state or imply that our Judiciary has been the cause, is responsible or is involvedin any manner in criminal involvement, especially as I have no such knowledge, and if any such perception or view was derived from my statement, I do humbly apologise, as I hold our judicial system in the highest regard,\\\" said Griffith in a statement yesterday. Last Friday, Griffith was quoted in an interview with the United Kingdom's Channel Four which featured this country's State of Emergency. Griffith was asked by Channel Four reporter Seyi Rhodes: \\\"It's probably no surprise to you to hear that every person I speak to in Trinidad, when I ask them where the drugs and the guns come from, they tell me that the ports, the customs authorities, the Coast Guard and the police are a 100 per cent involved in the trafficking of drugs and guns. Why are you not focussing on that\\\" Griffith replied: \\\"Every country in the world will have corrupt police officers, will have corrupt persons in the Judiciary, will have corrupt politicians. That is not an avenue to call a State of Emergency. We needed a State of Emergency to stop law abiding citizens of this country from being killed.\\\" This comment by Griffith prompted the Judiciary to issue a statement on Sunday. The statement by the Judiciary indicated that any reasonable person after listening to Griffith would conclude that the Judiciary is corrupt and tied in with the importation of guns and drugs to this country. In its statement, the Judiciary questioned whether Griffith was in possession of evidence on persons in the Judiciary which enables him to so \\\"confidently and poignantly\\\" link them with the importation of drugs and guns in the country in the current scenario of a State of Emergency in Trinidad and Tobago. The Judiciary challenged Griffith to justify his statements. Yesterday, in response to the Judiciary's criticisms and concerns, Griffith issued a statement where he explained his position. Griffith said the reporter had questioned why was the Government not going after the \\\"big fish\\\", referring to the persons in law enforcement agency and criminal justice system who could use their position and influence to assist in the major criminal acts being successful. \\\"What he (reporter) was referring to as persons in the law enforcement agency and criminal justicesystem who could use their position and influence to assist in the major criminal acts being successful,\\\" said Griffith. \\\"My response was to show that a State of Emergency is not designed to deal with such aspects, as it involves primarily crime prevention, which is hard targeting, patrols, and deterrents,\\\" he added. \\\"I stated that such reports and accusations have been known worldwide, as every country would be involved from time to time with allegations of such matters, including the involvement of politicians, law enforcement officers and even the Judiciary, but these matters have to be dealt with another level, and not specifically during a State of Emergency,\\\" said Griffith. His statement, he said, was based on what takes place globally and in general, and not in any way to include the Judiciary in Trinidad and Tobago. He noted that there was a conference held in Vienna several years ago, dealing with judicial corruption, and the causes and economic consequences. He noted further that the Global Corruption Report in 2007 also dealt with judicial corruption based on findings from Transparency International whereby certain countries have been accused of such acts. \\\"Thankfully, our Judiciary has never been accused or has been involved in such acts, andwe should pride ourselves with this fact,\\\" said Griffith.

One of the major conclusions reached in the latest report on crime in Trinidad and Tobago, carried exclusively in yesterday's Sunday Express, has stated that the problem of gun-related crime will not go away. Not at least anytime soon. As the author of the report put it, \\\"steps by the government to bolster law enforcement and curb smuggling are hobbled by a worsening of civic attitudes.\\\" By this he meant simply that citizens have been refusing to repose faith in the ability of the authorities to reverse the trend, one that has been intensifying and going upward for more than a decade now. \\\"Citizens are downright cynical about the ability of the state to reverse the mayhem caused by guns and gangs,\\\" the report's author concluded. As sources for the information used in compiling this report, little of which comes as brand new to the people of Trinidad and Tobago and those paying close attention to current developments here, the report relied on conversations with and data provided by an array of individuals including those in the media, in the police service itself, in some of the country's non-governmental organisations and university professors.One significant finding this report makes about the local situation is the complexity involved in the crime problem, with its roots deep into the culture of gangs and drugs that has sprung up over the years. Such complexity is illustrated by what the author described in his finding that \\\"a variety of forces stand arrayed against efforts at improvement\\\". Weeks before he was to have been granted a third extension last month on his tenure as the country's Acting Commissioner of Police, James Philbert provided his own insight into the central theme of this latest report. He had disclosed that some 42,000 citizens had submitted applications for firearms licences. Such a disclosure would have presented perhaps the most graphic clue to what this new report has revealed, that public trust in the ability of the state and its related agencies in crime fighting has plummeted. The job to rebuild it continues to prove extremely difficult, compounded by the general lack of confidence which large sections of the public have in the integrity of police officers. With criminal activity of one kind or another among individual officers, or groups of them acting in concert, a regular feature of media reports, such attitudes among members of the public only harden by the day. Constant pleadings by successive Commissioners and other leading police officials for public co-operation in the provision of information and intelligence to investigating officers have not been bearing sufficient fruit.

The items confiscated are a pump action shotgun, one rifle, six magazines, five pistol holsters, a telescope and 381 rounds of assorted ammunition. Chief of Defence Staff Brigadier Kenrick Maharaj yesterday stated that soldiers raided a bushy area, where they conducted several searches and found the items. Hours before the stash of arms and ammunition were found, Port of Spain CID officers had raided a gang territory off Picton Road, Laventille, and seized a Venezuela-made FAL high-powered rifle, two military bullet-proof vests, 257 rounds of assorted ammunition, several ski masks, genuine military camouflage uniforms, firearm holsters and a quantity of marijuana. \\\" As you see before you, two weapons and a number of different types of ammunition were discovered hidden in Central Trinidad. It was based on a tip to one of our numbers and a section plus of military personnel were deployed to that location rapidly and were able to unearth, literally, what you see before you. Maharaj promised that the army would not let up until the fight against crime was won. \\\"I will assure the public that this is really the sign of things to come,\\\" Maharaj said. Commissioner of Police Dwayne Gibbs yesterday stated that between 8. a.m. on Monday and 8. a.m. yesterday, six illegal guns and in excess of 600 rounds of ammunition were seized. The latest seizure brings to the number of illegal weapons confiscated by law enforcement agencies since the start of the state of emergency to 21. Gibbs pointed out that 74 persons were arrested during the same period, 37 of them on gang related charges, while 15 were for drug related offences, six for serious crimes, 13 on outstanding warrants, two in connection with murders and 93 traffic offence tickets issued by police. He noted that since the start of the State of Emergency, 894 persons were arrested, 335 of them on gang related offences.

Seetahal's assassination sets a dangerous and destabilising precedent, Vieira, an attorney, said in the Senate. Seetahal served as an independent senator from 2002 to 2010. The mood in the Senate was overwhelmingly sombre and heavy as the Senate paid tribute to Seetahal. There was one theme throughout the tributes\\u2014that her death was not simply the murder of another person by the hands of criminals, but represented an irreplaceable and significant loss. She literally gave her talent, her commitment, her love and sadly her life, to this country. The sentiment expressed by those who spoke was she was married to her dedication to Trinidad and Tobago\\u2014a true public servant, whether she was part of the civil service or not. An emotional Vieira said: \\\"This premeditated and carefully executed assassination goes beyond the murder of a defenceless woman\\u2014it represents an attack on our justice system and an attack on law and order itself. \\\"It calls for a frank assessment of the existing deficiencies in our criminal justice system; and our law enforcement and security capabilities, particularly bearing in mind that Trinidad and Tobago falls within a network of drug-trafficking and international criminal activity (including gun-running, money-laundering and drug related crimes). \\\"And it calls us to consider whether our law enforcement architecture has the requisite capability to effectively address this latest form of terror tactics and the non-traditional types of crime.\\\" He added: \\\"We can no longer proceed in our customary, relaxed manner. We need to restore public confidence and reduce the feelings of insecurity and disquiet which now grips the nation. \\\"Among other things, we need to upgrade our security laws, develop our intelligence-gathering capabilities, and allocate the necessary resources to protect those serving at the front line and who may be at risk; in particular judges, magistrates and prosecutors handling high-profile criminal cases. \\\"I stand with the Police Complaints Authority director Gillian Lucky in demanding action from the State to protect them.\\\" Vieira continued: \\\"We have become adjusted and have grown to accept the deterioration of our criminal justice system. Dana's death must serve as a call to arms to all who would establish the rule of law and justice in the affairs and men.\\\" He added that this was a solemn moment in the course of the country's struggle for law and order. He said it needed to be recognised that \\\"we can't have a free, safe and stable society if we lack an overarching strategy to cope with the crime and security challenges\\\". He said the Dana he knew was warm and engaging, full of good spirit and humour and possessed of the highest ideals. He said: \\\"I remember the younger Dana jogging all over the place, most times alone. She was fearless. Dana celebrated who we are as a people and all the aspects that make up our culture. She loved life and was a 'Trini to the bone'. \\\"Dana was comfortable in her own skin, equally at ease whether dealing with the highest or lowest in the land.\\\" Vierra said: \\\"As a friend, as a practising attorney-at-law and as a member of the Independent bench, I wish to acknowledge with deep gratitude and appreciation Dana's considerable and important contributions: in the law courts, in the halls of academia, in the media, in the Law Association, and in this Honourable Senate.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Back in August 2011, the shock of multiple gangland killings had jolted the government's into triggering the emergency, itself a shock response. The emergency entailed a curfew, and the roll-out of heavy, \\\"zero-tolerance\\\", policing. It also engendered a sense of the balance of power being shifted in favour of the forces of law and order. The effect was to depress (but not extinguish) gang activity, to disrupt related criminal pattern and practice, and to hold down the murder rate. Sighs of relief naturally arose. But not all fingers could stay crossed in hope that such advances in the \\\"war on crime\\\" could be sustained past the emergency. Even during the emergency, the sweeps and swoops to enforce the new anti-gang laws ominously backfired. If the police were over-zealous in making arrests based on the untested anti-gang legislation, the DPP was to the same degree unmoved by any sense of urgency to put alleged gangsters before the courts, if only to test the legislation. No \\\"silver bullet\\\" solution, it was proved, was available for the defeat of drug-related gangsterism and associated murderous violence. By early December, when the emergency ended, no viable \\\"crime plan\\\" was in sight to wrest the initiative away from the shadowy axis of drug runners and their hired guns. Last weekend, fatal gunplay in northern St James, evidently combined the elements of gang rivalry, illegal drugs and effortless acquisition of firearms. Over that weekend, too, police interdiction in Arima yielded $15 million worth of ganja together with an Uzi submachine gun, a Remington repeater shotgun, and related ammunition. Another emergency is unthinkable. Certainly, however, it is timely to reassess law enforcers' preparedness for confronting gangs. In last week's Business Express, the Trinidad and Tobago Chamber of Industry and Commerce spoke up as one critical interest group querying what law enforcement progress has been made since December. Have the police and the DPP come together with a workable plan of action To what extent are those two vital agencies still working at cross purposes, thereby disserving the national interest in gang, drug, and gun crime containment If the anti-gang legislation has been shown to need amendment, when will Parliament be asked to do so If the police were seen to need specialised training, what has taken place to improve their approaches toward gang violence and the relentless rise in murders In all this, a finger of accountability points in one inescapable directionto the leadership and management of the police.

Robberies and burglaries, many of them as brazen as ever, CCTV recordings notwithstanding, gallop at an alarming pace. Acts of violence, threats that could turn crimson (as in blood), and entire communities cowed by gun-toting bullies, now a national pastime, go mostly unreported, except, perhaps, to Ian Alleyne and Crime Watch. Why The police have more serious matters to attend to. The daily media briefings, for example, a feature that emerged during the State of Emergency, an exercise in numbers crunching, has morphed into a 21st Century policing initiative. Image is important. Stars are manufactured. Oh, I almost forgot. There was that all-important issue of executing a warrant on an errant watchman who failed to pay child maintenance. Summon the troops. Jeep-loads of armed-to-the-teeth police officersand dont forget the battering-ram. Or the resident Jet-Li. Move in during the still of the night. The target is armed and dangerous. What is happening in the Police Service Is this a case where brawn still trumps brains Where thugs-in-uniforms are symbols of police prowess I hate to hurl yet another missile at besieged Commissioner Dwayne Gibbs, but such is the burden of command. I think that the Canadian has been unfairly targeted in instances...a scapegoat of sorts. But given his experience, he must have known that he was in for a rough ride as CoP in a service that is riddled with rogues, a force that remains steeped in the culture of thuggery, and a country in which tolerance translates into a license to be lawless. As is normal when columnists or others in the public make these observations, we qualify them by saying that many police officers execute their duties in a very professional manner, in accordance with their oaths of office. Sadly, all too often good policing by the many is overshadowed by the ugly actions of the few. What is worrisome is that the latter not only attract public attention, but their misconduct stands out like a big blot on the image of the entire Service. Last Wednesday night, a number of them descended on the Laventille compound of the Transport and Industrial Workers Union. Their mission, it seems, was to arrest a night watchman who had an outstanding warrant for not paying child maintenance money as ordered by a court. You would think that one or two officers, maybe armed with batons, would suffice. Instead, what ought to have been a routine exercise turned into a display of thuggery that has always existed in the Service, but which, with the advent of CCTV cameras, is now available live and alive for public consumption. And what the public saw was not nice. It was almost as if a nearby gang had descended on the unions headquarters, bent on mayhem and murder. The police action, a wanton abuse of their powers, was ugly...and thats putting it mildly. In the aftermath, they left a trail of destruction of property and many unanswered questions. Who authorised the raid Why Did the police not have serious crimes to arrest rather than batter a wayward father and in the process violate a trade unions headquarters The frequency with which incidents of police brutality and abuse of power have occurred is cause for grave concern. Two media houses have felt the full force of what I can only term rank stupidity on the part of officers. Workers at Trinidad Cement Ltd, conducting a legal strike, were also subjected to police boorishness. Many other incidents within recent times, some of them now sub judice, call into question the kind of training these officers undergo. It is not that police abuse of power is something new. Deviant elements in what was then appropriately named the Police Force used to bruise, batter, and sometimes kill civilians. Indeed, even soldiers were guilty of such misdeeds, although most times such incidents were retaliatoryas happened in Carenage in 1963. In recent times, though, soldiers have been accused of what I dub abuse of uniform. However, military justice is swift and often severe, not constrained by the niceties of civil or criminal law. The Commanding Officer of the Regiment (and the Coast Guard) wields immense power: he could jail and dishonourably discharge a junior officer or soldier, with loss of benefits, in short order. With regard to police abuse, what is different is that nowadays, with monitoring devices installed just about everywhere, the miscreants are easily identified and exposed to public scrutiny. How the Service deals with guilty officers is quite another matter. In many instances the authorities simply transfer the miscreants to stations located in rural districtswhich, in effect, amounts to transferring the problem, not resolving it in the best interests of the Service and the aggrieved parties. Or, some are suspended from duty with full pay for years. In rare cases, rogue officers face criminal charges, and even then they enjoy the protective cloak of their colleagues when they appear in court. With the image of the Service in near-tatters, the public can only hope that the high command and the judicial authorities act swiftly to restore confidence in the police. In the wake of the TIWU incident, we expect to see heads rolland not from one station to another. It is time to get rid of the roughnecks who bring the Service into disrepute.

See Page 8. \\u0097Photo: ROBERTO CODALLO MINISTER of Justice and Member of Parliament for St Joseph Herbert Volney is describing the police killing of Mt D'Or resident Atiba Duncan as a homicide. He said yesterday his assertion is supported by the findings of the pathologist who performed the post-mortem and the account of eyewitnesses that 26-year-old Duncan was shot in his back at close range. Volney is also calling for the police officers involved to be immediately placed on suspension, pending the outcome of investigations into the incident. Volney was speaking at a news conference at the Ministry of Justice located at Tower C of the Waterfront Centre in Port of Spain. Also present was chairman of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) Gillian Lucky, who said she had to remind Police Commissioner Dwayne Gibbs of the established protocol, which requires that the PCA be informed in a timely manner when incidents, such as the Duncan killing, occur. Eyewitnesses to the April 4 killing said Duncan, a footballer, was liming and smoking marijuana outside a shop at Mt D'Or Road, Champs Fleurs, when police approached and he ran. Residents claimed one of the two police officers held on to Duncan, who was unarmed, but he wrested himself free and took off before being shot. St Joseph Police reported that an attempt was made to execute an outstanding warrant for drug trafficking on Duncan when he ran off, pulled out a pistol and was about to pull the trigger when he was shot. \\\"I am very, very concerned that something is very wrong with the method of training of our police officers, especially the constables who are entrusted with high-powered rifles,\\\" Volney said. \\\"(The Duncan killing) is not the only such incident in our country in the last two years. According to statistics from the Crime And Problem Analysis Branch (CAPA), in 2010 there were 52 killings by police officers. In 2011, there were 43 killings. Out of these 43 killings, three were classified as murder. \\\"Any killing of a citizen by a police officer must be with lawful justification. Police officers who are armed with firearms, while they have a function to do, they must exercise great caution in carrying out their legitimate function. The use of a firearm, except in instances of obvious self-defence, is unjustifiable use and overuse of a lawful weapon.\\\" Volney said eyewitnesses readily admitted Duncan had a small quantity of marijuana in his possession which he tried to get rid of when the police arrived on the scene. \\\"(Based on the post-mortem report), this means that the deceased was shot by the police officer in his back as he was fleeing. From the reports at hand, this appears to be nothing short of a homicidal killing. I say this not just as an MP, but also as a former justice of the High Courtone who has presided over hundreds of criminal trials. \\\"This sort of behaviour by police officers will no longer be tolerated by the Ministry of Justice. We will not sit by idly and allow this to take place. Atiba Duncan had weed and not a gun. And you don't kill a man in this country for being in possession of weed. That is the law.\\\" Volney also accused the police officers of failing in their duty when they returned to the area, not to take Duncan to the hospital, but to retrieve spent shells. He said they failed to preserve the scene of a crime. Asked about the plan of his Ministry to address other similar abuses of power, Volney said he has already raised the issue at the level of Cabinet. \\\"The Police Service at this time under the leadership of commander Dwayne Gibbs, or is it Dr Dwayne Gibbs, seems to be a service without leadership. It seems to be a service without a policy. It is a runaway service. And while I am not here to pound the police, because there are many good police officers, there are many in the Police Service who are too quick to draw the gun. The gun is a last resort.

It is a serious problem in this country,\\\" said Tewarie in his contribution to the Defence and Police Complaints Authority Amendment Bill, 2013 at the Senate sitting, Tower D, International Waterfront Centre, Port of Spain, on Tuesday. More than 20,000 people, he said, in the past decade, from 2002 to date, had been affected by crime. Tewarie said more than 4,000 people were murdered, and this meant that there were 4,000 families left in grief. \\\"Just over 7,600 have felt a bullet or a cutlass or some blunt or sharp instrument on them, traumatising, again, 7,610 families; and rapes, incest and other sexual offences, over 7,800 cases, making it a total of 20,000 people who have been directly affected by crime in the form of murder, that is to say, they are dead and their families remain to mourn; wounding and shootings and, therefore, their families have had to live with the trauma; and rape, incest and other sexual offences, nearly 8,000, 7,800, and their families have also had to live with this experience,\\\" said Tewarie. The minister said the mental state of the people is being affected. \\\"What does the ripple effect of a murder in a family have on the people in the community in which that person lives, or in the people in the family that are connected to them, whether they live in the resident community or outside \\\"What is the impact of all of this on the people who are sexually molested and by the woundings and the shootings What is the impact What do you think happens to the society\\\" he asked. Not dealing with crime, Tewarie said, was creating a situation in which we had to perpetually live with this kind of condition, which was \\\"psychiatrically unacceptable\\\" for this small country. Tewarie said dealing with crime means lessening the trauma on people who have been affected like this over the last decade. He noted that as crime grows, the security industry in this country also grew, with just 7,000 law enforcement officers in the Police Service and just under 3,000 in the military service. Some 276 officers, he said, were at Immigration, 488 were deployed to Customs and Excise, and yet there were problems in the system which resulted in drugs and gun-running pervading the society. He noted further that recently, 75 women were before the court charged with soliciting for the purpose of prostitution. \\\"But the question I have to ask when they go to court is: how did they get here in the first place, and who brought them here So, these things could not happen if you had functional systems in the society. \\\"You could not have 75 women from foreign countries parading in the court in one shot, unless you had dysfunctional systems that allowed such numbers to accrue. \\\"And, therefore, we have a serious problem here, and the challenge really has come to us, being in charge of the State, of how you deal with these matters,\\\" said Tewarie. Crime, he said, must be dealt with in a multifaceted and multipronged approach. Tewarie said the legislation was a necessary part of the arsenal to deal with these challenges. \\\"I would like to make this appeal for support for this bill because this bill is not about militarisation; this bill is about getting a functional capability in a dysfunctional system to deal with dysfunctionality in criminal behaviour in this society. That is what we need to do, and we have got to deal with it while we deal with other things in the society,\\\" he said.

The flawed ideas which these phrases reveal explain, in part, the failure to reduce the countrys homicide rate ten years after such crimes began to escalate. To start with, few killings are senseless. A senseless murder is one which has no pragmatic motive, and such murders are usually committed by psychopaths who kill purely for the pleasure of killing. Most murderers, however, have clear and understandable motives: usually, money or sexoften both. So, since the police themselves categorise most murders as gang- and/or drug-related, there are rational reasons for a certain category of young men to turn to these avenues in order to acquire resources and status. They have no other skills and, with an incompetent and corrupt police force, the risk of being caught is reasonably low. This is even truer of white-collar crime. Those persons who are criticised and condemned for fraud and corruption may be the target of calumny, but their lack of ethics has resulted in them being both rich and powerful. But non-murdering non-tiefing citizens have some indirect culpability as well. Even if the political system makes crime a rational economic choice for certain people, such political strategies would not be effective if they werent supported by cultural normsi.e. the moral values of the majority. And, generally speaking, it is people who claim to be most moral who have devoted the least thought to moral principles. Why should they, when they know what is moral and what is not It is therefore doubly foolish when journalists approach religious leaders for their views on crime. Apart from few if any of them having a background in criminology, crime is not a moral problem, but a problem of politics, economics, and ethics. Moral pronouncements therefore distract from real solutions. Once we start from the premise that most criminals are acting rationally, then solutions beyond strong-arm tactics and punishment can be formulated. So we have to ask why murders suddenly increased in 2003 My view is that this was a direct consequence of then-prime minister Patrick Manning trying to bribe gang leaders with URP monies to stop killing one another. But I may be wrong, and the increase may have been caused by other factors, such as drug dealers paying off their low-level distributors on the block with guns as well as money. In the latter case, the solution would be to stop the trafficking in guns. This, however, seems nigh impossible. The trade in cocaine and marijuana is too profitable for too many people, including many persons in official posts, for any counter-incentives to work. And if that is the case, then the only effective solution would be to reduce the drug dealers profits by decriminalising or legalising marijuana and cocaine. But people like Pastor Clive Dottin, who is viewed by influential persons as a crime-fighting expert, would oppose such a measure because they are more interested in pushing their groundless beliefs than in saving lives. The only viable long-term strategy therefore lies in changing attitudes, especially towards violence. There are four socio-political measures which are likely to have good effects in this regard: 1. banning corporal punishment; 2. abolishing capital punishment; 3. legalising abortions; and 4. giving homosexual persons the same human rights as heterosexual ones. These measures embody opposition to violence as a solution to problems, empowerment of poor women resulting in better child-care, and tolerance of difference. If such laws were passed, then this society could become a more enlightened and peaceful place before babies crying today become adults who kill tomorrow. kevin.baldeosingh@zoho.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Pan Jammers \\u0097Photo: Dave Persad KILLED IN JULY: This undated photo provided by Robert Sullivan shows Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person slain in the July 20 attack that left 12 dead and dozens wounded during the Aurora theatre shootings. The National Rifle Association, the largest gun lobby in the United States, suggested shielding children from gun violence by placing an armed police officer in every school by the time classes resume in January. l WASHINGTON Before 20 children were massacred at school by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, Luke Schuster, 6, was shot dead in New Town, North Dakota. Six-year-olds John Devine Jr and Jayden Thompson were similarly killed in Kentucky and Texas. Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, died in a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, while 6-year-old Kammia Perry was slain by her father outside her Cleveland home, according to an Associated Press review of 2012 media reports. Yet there was no gunman on the loose when Julio Segura-McIntosh died in Tacoma, Washington. The 3-year-old accidentally shot himself in the head while playing with a gun he found inside a car. As he mourned with the families of Newtown, President Barack Obama said the US cannot accept such violent deaths of children as routine. But hundreds of young child deaths by gunfirewhether intentional or accidentalsuggest it might already have. Between 2006 and 2010, 561 children under 12 were killed by firearms, according to the FBI's most recent Uniform Crime Reports. The numbers each year are consistent: 120 in 2006; 115 in 2007; 116 in 2008, 114 in 2009 and 96 in 2010. The FBI's count does not include gun-related child deaths that authorities have ruled accidental. \\\"This happens on way too regular a basis and it affects families and communitiesnot at once, so we don't see it and we don't understand it as part of our national experience,\\\" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The true number of small children who died by gunfire in 2012 will not be known for a couple of years, when official reports are collected and dumped into a database and analysed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to release its 2011 count in the spring. In response to what happened in Newtown, the National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby, suggested shielding children from gun violence by putting an armed police officer in every school by the time classes resume in January. \\\"Politicians pass laws for gun-free school zones... They post signs advertising them and in doing so they tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,\\\" said NRA executive vice-president Wayne LaPierre. Webster said children are more likely to die by gunfire at home or in the street. They tend to be safer when they are in school, he said. None of the 61 deaths reviewed by The Associated Press happened at school. Children die by many other methods as well: violent stabbings or throat slashings, drowning, beating and strangulation. But the gruesome recounts of gun deaths, sometimes just a few paragraphs in a newspaper or on a website, a few minutes on television or radio, bear witness that firearms too, are cutting short many youngsters' lives. One week before the Newtown slayings, Alyssa Celaya, 8, bled to death after being shot by her father with a .38-calibre gun at the Tule River Indian Reservation in California. Her grandmother and two brothers also were killed, a younger sister and brother were shot and wounded. The father shot and killed himself amid a hail of gunfire from officers. Delric Miller's life ended at nine months and Angel Mauro Cortez Nava's at 14 months. Delric was in the living room of a home on Detroit's west side February 20 when someone sprayed it with gunfire from an AK-47. Other children in the home at the time were not injured. Angel was cradled in his father's arms on a sidewalk near their home in Los Angeles when a bicyclist rode by on June 4 and opened fire, killing the infant. Most media reports don't include information on the type of gun used, sometimes because police withhold it for investigation purposes. Gun violence and the toll it is taking on children has been an issue raised for years in minority communities. The NAACP, a civil rights group, failed in its attempt to hold gun makers accountable through a lawsuit filed in 1999. Some in the community raised the issue during the presidential campaign and asked Obama after he was re-elected to make reducing gun violence, particularly as a cause of death for young children, part of his second-term agenda. \\\"Now that it's clear that no community in this country is invulnerable from gun violence, from its children being stolen... we can finally have the national conversation we all need to have,\\\" said Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP. This year's gun deaths reviewed by the AP show the problem is not confined to the inner city or is simply the result of gang or drug violence, as often is the perception. Faith Ehlen, 22 months, Autumn Cochran, 10, and Alyssa Cochran, 11, all died September 6. Their mother killed them with the shotgun before turning it on herself. Police said she had written a goodbye e-mail to her boyfriend before killing the children in DeSoto, Missouri, a community of about 6,300. In Dundee, Oregon, Randall Engels used a gun to kill his estranged wife Amy Engels and their children, Jackson, 11, and Bailey, 13, while they were at the table eating. The children were each shot twice. Engels also shot and killed himself. The town of more than 5,000 boasts on its website that it is a semi-rural town with \\\"the cultural panache of a big city.\\\" Many of the children who died in 2012 were shot with guns that belonged to their parents, relatives or baby sitters, or were simply in the home. Webster said children's accidental deaths by guns have fallen since states passed laws requiring that guns be locked away from youths or have safeties to keep them from firing. But even people trained in gun use slip upand the mistakes are costly. A Springville, Utah, police officer had a non-service gun in his home that officials said did not have external safeties. His 2-year-old son found the gun and shot himself on September 11. The names of the father and son were not released at the time of the shooting. Obama has tapped Vice President Joe Biden to shape the administration's response to the Newtown massacre. The administration will push to tighten gun laws, many that have faced resistance in Congress for years. The solutions may include reinstating a ban on assault-style rifles, closing gun buying background check loopholes and restricting high-capacity magazines. Those may have limited effect for children like Amari Markel-Purrel Perkins, of Clinton, Maryland. He shot himself in the chest on April 9 with a gun that an adult had stashed inside a Spider-Man backpack. Like most of the child victims at Newtown, Amari was six.

He was calling down liquor from the shelves with the rapidity and rapacity of an auditor from PwC intent on sucking up to Lawrence Duprey or sealingthe deal on a penthouse at One Woodbrook Place. I was forced to take a drink, then two and so it went. As my friend Dick said, \\\"If they call it Vat 19 then that is how many drinks you should take.\\\" I thanked the Almighty, who probably was checking his watch at the time to see if I was there for the start of the service, that it was not Vat 69 in which case I would have as much on my hands as on my lips. Eventually when the owner, Malcolm Saney, spoke very softly to \\\"Ghost\\\" about making some kind of good faith payment to cover what he had already demanded and we had already consumed, \\\"Ghost\\\" said loudly enough for everbody to hear, \\\"Saney, my name is 'Crime' and crime don't pay.\\\" It was a bitter lesson for the bar owner but he came out of it alive. Crime, unfortunately, does pay and that is why so many regiment and police officers are involved in it. That is also why it is also escalating. It is undoubtedly the reason that many societies cannot cope and are not sure exactly where things went wrong and the country went off the rails. A week ago in Antigua church leaders, government officials and many citizens held a National Day of Prayer and Fasting which, according to the Daily Observer newspaper, \\\"was held as a means of intervention and spiritual guidance on the way forward, as the country continues to grapple with a spate of gun-related crimes\\\". Sounds familiar The point is that only if you follow the news closely over a period of time you are able to identify the way crime takes over a society and the extent to which people paid to maintain law and order become part of the problem instead of the solution. Is there some functionary or mechanism in the Ministry of National Security, the police service or the regiment, for noting when police and soldiers are involved in crime or cost the taxpayers money by their lawless behaviour Right now it is said that a matter involving policemen in an unlawful death is being investigated. I doubt that anything significant will come out of this. It is reputed that \\\"Ghost\\\" got his power because of a tight connection with a former Commissioner of Police and that when Ghost was paralysed the man actually brought him drugs in the hospital. Rachel Price emphasised something that many of us have previously spoken about. If you can bring in grown women from Latin America to work as prostitutes, how many guns can you land on our beaches I figure after drugs and guns we will have musical instruments coming in and the next thing you know we will have robbery with violins. In this comic opera country as the sin-phony unfolds, crime might not only pay but play.
