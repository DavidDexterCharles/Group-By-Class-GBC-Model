Plain and simple, the squandering we need to be concerned about is the squandering of every opportunity to diversify the economy. Since I was a little boy I was told never to put all my eggs in one basket. Every prime minister who had a strong economy failed to diversify the economy. The problem is that they were not innovative and when they tried to diversify they chose the wrong industry, and you need more than one option. What they needed to do was facilitate the inventive and the innovative. That would involve making funds available for research and development and prototypes etc. There are some funds for intellectual property protection, but not enough. There is a need for contract manufacturing factories. These factories would be built on demand, the infrastructure would have to be in place. These industrial parks would have a retail outlet that would sell products from all the manufacturers. Lean and just-in-time manufacturing would be practiced at these factories to reduce start-up costs. These businesses would be start-ups and incubators in one and would be monitored for a year, with help from mentors and other experts. Our small workforce would hamper our productivity and competitiveness. We therefore would have to go high tech. There is a new kind of robot called a \\u201cco-bot''; it is designed to work with human beings. This would improve productivity and competitiveness. Companies that need foreign exchange to survive, and they are many, could start a venture capital fund that would be used for manufacturing start-ups. If we did not have income from oil and gas, how would we have financed billion-dollar budgets IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling.

International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder.

And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months.

Central and eastern European countries (EU-CEE) will continue to grow above the European average, with growth expanding over 2.4 per cent in 2015, based on robust consumer demand, the gradual return of investment, and continued export growth, says the new World Bank EU Regular Economic Report launched last week in Brussels.The pick-up in 2014 was particularly strong in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, and the United Kingdom, while southern European countries finally returned to growth following significant financial and economic restructuring, and despite growing concerns about financial strains in Greece and generally weak global trade.Exports have been the main driver of growth in many EU-CEE countries, such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, said Mamta Murthi, World Bank Country Director for Central Europe and the Baltic Countries. That has been partly due to foreign direct investment (FDI) helping countries integrate into global value chains and push exports. However, as FDI has declined following the crisis, there is greater need for countries to focus on improving business environments, developing skills, encouraging innovation, investing in infrastructure, and reducing regulatory barriers to encourage renewed FDI and export growth.According to the report, strengthening economic growth and improvements at the labour market will help to limit the share of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Since 2008, the EU-CEE share of people at risk of poverty increased to over 23 per cent, as slower growth resulted in job losses, especially among the young and less skilled, pushing them below the poverty line. Going forward, the report says that economic recovery and reduction in unemployment rates, along with increased fiscal space for social expenditures in some EU-CEE countries, will lead to the gradual decline in poverty.While the growth outlook for Europe is moderately optimistic, fuelled by the one-off fall in oil prices and ECB quantitative easing, the report says that several risks need to be carefully managed, including: (1) the potential increase in financial market volatility as the US and EU implement divergent monetary policy; (2) fresh pressure on public finances from the combination of low inflation and modest growth; (3) the limited availability of new lending for investment, due to low returns and incomplete bank reforms; and (4) the potentially negative impact on confidence stemming from ongoing financial strains in Greece or ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine.According to Theo Thomas, lead economist in the World Banks Europe and Central Asia region and Team Leader of the EU RER, The medium and long term challenge in many countries is to shift policy from fiscal and macroeconomic adjustment towards structural measures to promote growth and competitiveness. Structural reforms include continuing to reduce labour market rigidities, enhancing the business environment, reducing barriers to trade (including in services within the EU), and promoting the skills needed for dynamic job creation and innovation. This will need to be combined with affordable social policies that help to protect the most vulnerable, while promoting greater social and labour market inclusion.

However, our Government will continue as usual with its spending until we are actually affected and then adjustments will be made. Also, the Minister assured us that there is no intention to use the Heritage Stabilisation Fund to complement the Government's revenues for the present budgeted plans and that the Ministry of Finance has embarked on research to inform future policies in the light of the international situation. The Minister of Finance is correct to say that as long as the prices of petroleum and its products remain high (a fading phenomenon) and we have the resources (now rapidly depleting) to exploit, our economy will earn foreign revenues and our Government will have large amounts to spend. But the economy is a one-horse job and remains extremely vulnerable to external (petroleum-demand decrease) and internal (depleting resources) shocks. Our economy is structurally unsound, i.e. it is definitely not strong. Because of this structure and our current high earning capacity (as we transform our natural resources the country's crown jewelsinto spending money) the current Dutch disease is further disabling and reducing the breadth of the economy. I wrote an article in August 2007, \\\"Economic Risk Management\\\", which dealt with our Government's failure to manage the risks of the economy. I repeated that claim in the article, \\\"Chicken Little\\\" in October 2008. We have had a response from the Minister of Finance that because of such risk management by the Central Bank we have not suffered any major losses in the investment of our RSF or foreign reserves since these were invested in more conservative securities etc. However, the Minister has failed to address how the Government is dealing with the fundamental risk of operating a one-horse economy in the face of external shocks, characteristic of a petroleum economyin particular in the internal environment of depleting natural resources and the further collapse of the tourism and manufacturing industries. Minister Conrad Enill tells us that he does not see T&T being globally competitive in manufacturing because of China, and the Prime Minister tells us that he does not see any future for tourism in the region. The growing practice of robbing, raping and killing our visitors to Tobago will damage its tourism industry. The closure of the ex-Hilton Tobago because it is not making money does not bode well for that industry's strength in the sister isle. Next year's influx of conference tourists for which we are spending a lot of money is probably a flash in the pan. It is worth noting that both Ministers of Finance hold out much hope for the IFC in the diversification of our economy. I repeat, if the proposed IFC is about creating a local replica of the likes of Lehman Bros. and Bear Stearns, then we had better think again. Their performances on Wall Street were not about economic development and with tighter regulations in T&T (which may discourage their location here) it is difficult to see how such people can facilitate local economic development besides providing some in-house jobs. This column has presented much on the risk of reconstructing the on-shore economy. The fundamental tenet underpinning this is the need to build an Experimentally Organised Economy, a National Innovation System. The objective is to develop innovative small manufacturing enterprises that can become globally competitive both outside and within the energy sector. One of the basic requirements of such a system is the provision of risk financing and in particular venture capital. The proposed IFC is not about meeting this need. Listen to the World Bank on South Korea as it sought to transform itself into a knowledge economy: \\\"In Korea the emphasis is placed on collateral-based debt rather than on equity. This practice presents a bias against small start-up firms in knowledge-based industries which can incur high costs for knowledge-gathering (and development), but which generate little physical collateral. Improving access to equity capital is important to the success of knowledge-based businesses\\\". General education, even 60 per cent of the population at the tertiary level, existence of a limping stock market, universities that are geared to the production of certified graduates for the present economy and rich-consumer loan-oriented banks do not form the basis of an Experimentally Organised Economy. The present private sector has developed a survival system in this boom-bust economy and cannot respond to the reconstruction of the economyan observation Sir Arthur Lewis made many years ago. Thus, the failure of our Government to manage this economic risk is an enormous tragedy. maryking@tstt.net.tt TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

The ECAs Breakfast Meeting entitled The Business Implications of Falling Oil Prices was attended by representatives from a cross-section of businesses and industries last Wednesday at the Radisson Hotel in Port of Spain. Finance Minister Larry Howai was the feature speaker from a panel that included senior lecturer in the Department of Economics at The University of the West Indies Dr Roger Hosein, director of the ILO Decent Work Team Dr Giovanni di Cola and team leader of HR Solutions at the Employers Solution Centre LaToya Griffith. Howai addressed the governments plan to strengthen tax administration and collection at the BIR as well as accelerate refunds on past VAT arrears to the business community so that they can maintain their operational efficiency and profit levels during this time. This was one of several initiatives the Minster outlined as the Government attempts to implement revenue and expenditure policies to compensate for the decline in revenues from the energy sector, the ECA said in a statement. Howai also articulated his expectation that the business community will reciprocate and make commensurate VAT payments in a timely manner. When asked about the level of inefficiency in the public sector, which seems to impede attempts to make timely payments, the Minister called for a collaborative approach with all stakeholders, including trade unions, in addressing these issues. While he assured that the government does have an intention to address as many of these issues as they can, the Minister cautioned that it may get worse before it gets better. ILO director di Cola indicated that the implications for business depends on how long low prices will last but stressed on the need to focus on skills development and diversification of the economy, a point which Hosein also alluded to in his discussion when he cited the need to improve labour resource allocation. He posited a possible approach to achieving this by halting the decline in manufacturing and increasing productivity in the services sectors. Hosein also gave some potent figures on trends relating to labour and economic growth and maintained that substantive reform of the macro-economy is urgently needed, including CEPEP, and a restructuring of the GATE programme. He also pointed to the need to revamp the agricultural sector in an effort to diversify the economy, which will also assist in reducing the countrys food import bill, the ECA stated.

For the first time, too, the Ministry of Finance, also, will conduct a \\\"dialogue\\\" with young people to understand their points of view on the economy. Speaking at the launch of the Tunapuna Partnership Council (TPC), at which he was designated the \\\"chief servant\\\" of the executive council which will oversee the work of the TPC, Dookeran said the dialogue was the start of the process of deepening democracy in governance. Reiterating the National Treasury was empty, he said the \\\"people's energy\\\" derived from the dialogue process will go towards filling the Treasury. In the past, Dookeran said, the officers in the previous administration claimed they held consultation with the people but, in effect, they did not listen to them. At the end of the so-called consultation process, they designed the programmes without the input of the people. Due to the lack of consultation, the Finance Minister said he recommended they change the name to the \\\"dialogue process\\\" to engage in a genuine dialogue with the stakeholders business, labour, civil society, households and young people. Dookeran issued an invitation to young people throughout the country to take part in the sessions on the way forward for the economy with the Government.

Despite being de rigueur, the terms are often left in academic abstraction with seemingly little real world application. To the average person the word \\\"innovation\\\" might conjure images of iPads, hybrid cars, and other technological advances - in essence, the creation of new products, or retooling old ones to make them more efficient. While these are critical in shaping stronger and more competitive businesses, and by extension, economies, innovation can also be systemic. That is to say, innovation can also involve shifting the approaches to doing business so as to build dynamic enterprises. One area which has seen a dearth of such profound change, particularly in the developing country context, is that of SME financing. In the wake of the global economic crisis Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have become the 'darlings' of economic growth. These companies are well poised, by virtue of their small size, to allow for inclusive, sustainable growth by dynamising industrialization processes, stimulating employment and catalysing development in urban and rural areas. SMEs are also deemed to be better equipped to weather the storms of changing economic climates because of their innate ability to reconfigure and reform to suit the demands of a changing economy. Former minister of finance, Winston Dookeran, estimated that in Trinidad and Tobago, there are about \\\"18,000 SMEs, employing approximately 200,000 people or close to 35 per cent of the workforce and contributing near to 20 per cent of the gross domestic product.\\\" Small businesses have historically been hobbled by the inability to access credit and other traditional financial markets. Thus, while the clarion call has been trumpeted for SMEs to become more competitive through product innovation, most lack the requisite financing to make that happen. One of the principal factors affecting small-business lending is the perceived high risk of default rate. Small businesses often have limited sources of capital other than bank lending. This means they have to rely on cash flow to maintain operating expenses and still pay the bank their monthly loan payments. Further, many small businesses are comprised of young entrepreneurs or new managerial staff. This can lead to a work-in-progress organisation where mistakes can often be costly. Thus, banks are sometimes reluctant to support these growing businesses because of the risk involved in losing their investment. Another issue is the perception of greater financial risk, as small businesses have fewer assets to borrow against. If few assets are available and a business finds itself in financial trouble, it may be forced to close. However, banks will often provide asset-based lending, where a commercial loan is tied to a company's assets. Most governments seek to bridge the gaps in SME financing through the implementation of various programmes which take the form of soft loans and grant funding. These, however, are both unstable and unsustainable as they are highly dependent on the vagaries of the prevailing economic climate at the given time. One suggestion has been the establishment of a Junior Stock Exchange designed to allow investors to put capital into fledgling companies that exhibit the potential to develop the local economy by creating established and transparent businesses, jobs and ultimately, economic confidence. The initiative has however been met with some reticence despite the obvious advantages primarily because of the fear that a publicly listed company can be purchased \\\"lock stock and barrel\\\" by larger businesses in the market. In Trinidad and Tobago, where SMEs are primarily family owned and are viewed as a legacy to be handed down from generation to generation, this quite naturally is a major concern. Additionally, burdensome rules and regulations, the requirements of reporting, and the overall scrutiny, prove to be further disincentives to small businesses. In small economies such as ours, more innovative financing options may indeed prove to present better options for success. One such 'innovation' is that of 'crowd funding' or 'crowd financing', which allows large numbers of 'regular' people to invest small amounts in the purchase of equity stakes in small businesses online. Using a website platform, small businesses are able to market their ideas to a large number of investors with a local and foreign reach. This level of personalisation in raising seed-funding makes it easier for small businesses to be able side-step the usual red tape that attend larger equity offerings, as well as offers an opportunity for small entrepreneurs to raise capital without giving away too much equity. It is essentially like receiving a gift or a donation that you get to spend on your favourite project. Additionally, people who are raising capital through crowd financing can also use this as a relatively inexpensive marketing tool. Publishing information about a product or a project with a goal of raising capital on a well-read crowd funding platform also raises product or brand awareness. Crowd funding is not just limited to one single website. Supporters of the project disseminate the information using their social networks and encourage people in their networks to do the same. For this reason crowd financing can be a strong complement to cluster development campaigns. Of course there are the downsides to crowd financing such as the lack of protection from 'poachers' of new business ideas, limitations in the amount of money that can be raised, and the regulation of crowd-fund platforms. However, the implementation of proper legislation can help curtail some of the disadvantages. The United States government, for example, recently passed the \\\"Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS)\\\" which now makes it legal for entrepreneurs to use crowd funding to raise a limited amount of early-stage equity-based financing. Though still in its early stages, it certainly provides a beacon of hope for small businesses.

Rowley tore into the Government's performance since assuming office and criticised Finance Minister Winston Dookeran for failing to turn around the economy as he had promised in his budget presentation. Rowley slammed Dookeran for speaking about the economic crisis of countries around the globe while ignoring the fact the local economy was at a standstill due to Government's inactivity. \\\"It might very well be that the Minister of Finance is trying to fix our problems against a background of not understanding what the problem is,\\\" said Rowley. He said Government is too preoccupied with praising themselves as opposed to stimulating growth in the public and private sector. He said Government's failure to quickly appoint boards caused the economy to suffer due to further inactivity. Government's priorities, he said, are not in the right place as they went ahead before appointing a board to the Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) and made Ganga Singh that company's CEO. He added the failure to appoint the National Insurance Board (NIB) has contributed to the crippling of the economy. Turning to the private sector, Rowley said consumer confidence has been eroded as people are reluctant to spend and also fear for their job security. \\\"Trinidad and Tobago's banks right now are awash with money, there are $3 billion in local banks now, with nobody to borrow it,\\\" he said. He noted it is the Christmas season, and nothing is happening as business continues to dry up. Rowley knocked Dookeran for failing to address the unemployment issue or any of the tax measures, such as the property tax or the tax amnesty. In painting a gloomy picture of this country's economy, Rowley also pointed out there is no investor confidence and the cancellation of major projects deepened the economic crisis. He said although the aluminium smelter was cancelled, the partner in that project is still looking for recompensations as Government failed to issue instructions they were no longer proceeding with the project. Rowley also raised concerns over inactivity at the National Gas Company (NGC) where he said millions of cubic feet of gas per day were to be pumped into huge contracts which are either cancelled or at a standstill. He said the plastics industries and the Essar Steel plant, as well as a $1.5 billion gas-to-polypropylene plant, were all projects the NGC was supposed to provide with gas under contracts. \\\"These are the things the Minister of Finance should address in treating with Trinidad and Tobago's situation, rather than telling us what happens in Greece and Ireland that are treating with different issues,\\\" said Rowley.

The minor conflicts should not be dismissed as family squabbles as this is not a family business. This is the government of a country where confidence is what is required by investors. It is a major driving force of an economy. Today, I want us to reflect on the politics of the former National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) government and that of the current finance minister, and observe a similarity of iron-fisted inflexibility. Stringent measures were required, yes, but they were just not flexible. And no one must deny this was a major downfall of that administration. Why is the Government placing five per cent as the benchmark for settlement instead of negotiating and settling on merit This position is only asking for confrontation, resulting in great inconveni- ence to the public. Is this what we wanted Many so-called great minds feel to improve an economy is to cut the labour force and to cut production costs. So how would production increase Why isn't there confidence to borrow, even as interest rates have dropped The Planning and Finance ministries are the major facilitators of an economy, and if their policies and theories are ineffective, then there will be stagnation. The messages cannot be uncertain and contradictory. We must identify whether the various sectors can feed off the tourism, agriculture, manufacturing or petroleum sector. Can we produce $4 billion of food for local consumption and thereafter, to export Clearly, the petroleum sector has been the pillar of sustenance for this country and will continue to be so. So why do we continue to have such antagonism in that area There is no shortage of fuel, so why is the relatively simple delivery of this fuel to consumers posing a problem No one wants hardship to access basic commodities. We are talking of grand things, like others previously. Have we sought to take advantage of the earthquake that struck Japan There is a billion-dollar motor vehicle industry surrounding us. Are we seeking partnerships with the Japanese and our local businessmen to set up a motor car assembly plant here, and which can service the entire region We continue to look up in the sky while so many other things surround us.

In fact, president of the Trinidad and Tobago Manufacturers' Association Dr Rolph Balgobin believes the downgrade by the New York-based ratings firm does not mean that T&T's economy is weak. His view was one of several the Business Express sought last weekfollowing Moody's decision to downgradeT&T's bond and issuer ratings, from BAA1 to BAA2 and revise the outlook from stable to negative. Moody's identified three key drivers behind the downgrade- persistent fiscal deficits and challenging prospects for fiscal reforms, decline in oil prices and limited economic diversification and a weak macroeconomic policy framework given the lack of a medium-term fiscal strategy. ?I don't think that this downgrade was unexpected and the reason I say that is that the mainstay of our economy is energy and the global energy system has been in a tremendous state of flux, and so it is not unexpected when you see the kinds of changes in oil and gas prices we have witnessed, Balgobin said. He said Moody's concerns were legitimate. ?I think that the shortcomings that Moody's has identified are very clear, they are known to all of us. There are things that I think we in the economy have to continue to fix. Does it mean that theeconomy is in trouble I would say most certainly not, the Balgobin said. ?From a manufacturing standpoint, demand remains robust and in fact our big problem is labour and the feasibility of labour, so we have confidence in the economy and we think that we need to continue efforts to diversify. We think manufacturing is a very good option for diversification efforts and we are going to support a sensible diversification drive to the extent that it includes manufacturing, he added. But chief executive of the Trinidad and Tobago Chamber of Industry and Commerce Catherine Kumar had a different view. She said the downgrade was not good for the country. ?Whilst we are still investment grade, the fact that we've moved from BAA1 to BAA2 means that foreign investors will be looking at that, she said. ?I have heard the Minister of Planning say that they are already reviewing the medium term policy framework, taking all of these factors outlined by Moody's into consideration and that Government plans to do so within a short period of time, that's going to be very important. We are in an election year, we are in a year where budgets are due in September and based on the changes we are going to make in that medium term policy framework would impact on budgets also. She said Moody's downgrade should act as a serious wake-up call for this country to further act on strengthening its macroeconomic environment. She said while the Chamber was quite satisfied that the country's macro indicators are sound, T&T must ensure that those indicators do not slide in the wrong direction. ?The Government needs to pay close attention to it. University of the West Indies senior economics lecturer Dr Roger Hosein opined that the indication by Moody's should not be taken lightly. Like Balgobin, he pointed out that the downgrade came as nogreat surprise, particularly as oil and gas prices have been fairly flat between 2011 and June 2014. ?In this setting of stagnating production in the case of gas and falling production in the case of crude oil, and falling prices of both these key products, there has been an increase in Government expenditure, especially on transfers and subsidies, he said. Hosein said what should also be noted is that between 2005 and 2014, Government expenditure more than doubled, transfers and subsidies tripled and the fiscal balance moved into deficit. He said it is clear that T&T's economy is in need of structural adjustment, which has been the case since 2008. He said greater focus on manufacturing is needed. Pointing out that this sector employs 50,000 people, Hosein said if a strategy is designed to double the size of the manufacturing sector then this would accelerate the amount of long term sustainable jobs created. ?The seven e TecK parks planned by the government for various places within the economy have to be brought onto the front burner as the direct employment and indirect opportunities would help stabilise the long term growth performance of the economy, which is at a new normal lower level. As the economy progresses a process will have to be formulated that spurs a greater alignment of wage demand with productivity increases, especially in the now crisis hit petroleum sectors. ?Unreasoned demand for wage increases by trade unions must be a thing of the past as there is no longer any basis for such, logical or otherwise. Unreasoned wage increases which are higher than associated productivity increasingly compromises the overall competitiveness of the economy. Already output per worker in some segments of the economy has fallen and Moody's would have no doubt considered all these factors in its decision to downgrade the economy, Hosein said. Review Transfers and Subsidies Moody's said one of its rationales behind the downgradedwas the country's rigid structure of public expenditurewhich limits fiscal flexibility. It made reference to the fact that wages, subsidies and transfers account for more than 65 per cent of total expenditure. Balgobin, Kumar and Hosein agreed that Government must review its transfers and subsidies. ?I think it is imperative to balance the budget, it is something that any sensible economist or business person would call for, Balgobin said. ?You want to be operating from the fundamental position where you are living within your means, where you are not spending more than you are earning. That being said, the structure of the social economic landscape in T&T is such that a sudden withdrawal of social programmes can actually lead to some social dislocation, he said. While Balgobin acknowledged Government would maintain its position that a significant segment of the population is not competitive and needs help in order to get by, it must move to wean people off the dependency syndrome as soon as possible. Kumar stated: We do believe that the percentage that goes into transfers and subsidies is way too high for this country. Yes we have the energy sector and the rents from the energy sectorallow us to do that but we have to ensure that we save fora rainy day. We recognise there is need for social programmes, there will always be the vulnerable in our society who need to be looked after and certainly as a caring nation and a caring Chamber we would want to see that continue and that Government looks after those who are not able to look after themselves. However, does that have to be to the extent that it is now Hosein said he was hoping that the downgrade helps to persuade the few remaining resistant groups that the fuel subsidy should be adjusted. ?This subsidy comes at a great fiscal cost to the economy and its contribution to the economy's global competitiveness is at best marginal. Indeed the fuel subsidy may have backfired as it may have stimulated an abnormal demand for vehicles in the T&T economy, given low interest rates in the banking system. The rapid increase in the number of vehicles would have increased traffic congestion, decreased worker punctuality and even regularity and also increased overall levels of pollution. Last week Finance Minister Larry Howai hosted a group of representatives from financial institutions, including the Bankers Association, the Insurance Companies Association, Unit Trust and the National Insurance Board. Howai reiterated that the Government recognises the need to address issues raised by Moody's. However, he outlined reasons why he has described the Moody's rating as not properly taking all of T&T's macroeconomic strengths into full consideration: ?Given that Trinidad and Tobago's financial state is just as good if not better than a few months ago when Moody's gave a Baa1-rating to our country, Howai noted in a statement, pointing out that the Moody's statement provided no figures in support of their findings, but cited certain characteristics of the T&T economy which are all affected and shaped by global factors. He listed the many indicators of a strong T&T economy, inclusive of: the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund now standing at US$5.6 billion; the country's official reserves resting at US$10.8 billion; the Debt-to-GDP ratio at a comfortable 43 per cent; inflation in single digits; and unemployment at an historic low of 3.6 per cent, the statement said. Speaking after the meeting, former Minister of Finance and now chairman of Unit Trust Wendell Mottley extended assurances with his perspectives on both the Moody's decision and the opportunity presented to the Government of T&T. He said that the downgrade has not affected the price of the investments which the Unit Trust holds, and he expressed satisfaction at that, the statement said. He added that from his experience in Government during times of economic challenges, we have survived by being proactive; and we are now in such a time again so we simply have to be forward-thinking.

Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar gave a sneak-peak of the fiscal package as she addressed, the opening of the International Food Festival, at the Hilton Trinidad, Port of Spain, yesterday. In outlining Government's development plan, the Prime Minister said her administration will create employment by boosting its construction drive. The inflation rate will be kept down, she said, by increasing productivity and putting construction workers back to work. \\\"This budget proposes to increase infrastructure development specifically in areas that will provide the jobs in engineering and construction sectors so necessary in reducing the unemployment levels,\\\" she said. It is expected that there will be goodies for the business community as the Prime Minister said the budget will contain incentives for investors and businesses to provide well paying jobs to people. \\\"It is my hope that our businesses will take advantage of the incentives provided in the budget and play their part to begin the task in earnest of putting our economy back on a growth path. In this regard, we may wish to note that there are a number of investment projects in the pipeline that hold the potential for significant investments for Trinidad and Tobago. In addition there are initiatives afoot to leverage this country's petrochemical services expertise in emerging oil economies,\\\" she said. The Express understands that a significant allocation will be made to the Sport Ministry to implement programmes to prevent youths from entering into a life of crime. Monies will continue to be injected into the areas of health, national security, infrastructure and education as well as social development. Persad-Bissessar has given the assurance that her Government would ensure that this country overcomes its economic challenges and vowed that under her governance there would be no need to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As the nation continues under a State of Emergency, the Prime Minister also assured that her Government will put an end to the crime scourge. \\\"We will overcome, as we must, this challenge of escalating crime and we will come out of this economic crisis with our heads raised high and our dignity intact. (There will be no resort to the IMF on our watch),\\\" said Persad-Bissessar. The Prime Minister made the remarks in a pre budget statement where she hinted at some areas which would benefit most from the 2012 multi billion dollar budget which will be delivered by Finance Minister Winston Dookeran at the Parliament's new home tomorrow at Tower D, of the Waterfront Complex, Port of Spain. Persad-Bissessar reminded the nation that the world is in financial trouble as she pointed out that developed countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are struggling to keep unemployment down and attract investor confidence. She said this country is now being inundated with increasing requests for jobs by our diaspora in the United States. \\\"In Europe, the threat of imminent bankruptcy faces several countries including Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. The traditionally defined developed world are facing as I speak, significant economic growth challenges compared to economies like China, India, Brazil and Indonesia. Although, even China, the bright spot in the world economy, has had to revise downwards its forecasts for economic growth due to prospects of declining global demand for its goods and services and the threat of an overheated economy,\\\" said Persad-Bissessar. She further noted that our Caribbean neighbours are also suffering from financial woes as their market for our goods and services have been severely challenged to the point where the IMF is now being considered as a potential source of assistance.

A woman looks at sunglasses inside the new Kenneth Cole boutique during its grand opeing inside the Kinam Hotel complex in Petionville, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, last Thursday. A new World Bank Group report finds that over the past year, 50 per cent of economies in the Caribbean implemented at least one reform making it easier for local entrepreneurs to do business-12 reforms in total, an historical high for the region. Doing Business 2015: Going Beyond Efficiency finds that Jamaica had the regions biggest improvement in the ease of doing business in the past year, thanks to three reforms in areas measured by the report. Jamaica streamlined the requirements for starting a business, reduced the cost of getting an electricity connection, and established new credit bureaus while also adopting a new secured transactions law that broadens the range of assets that can be used as collateral. Joining Jamaica in implementing multiple regulatory reforms were the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago. The Dominican Republic made cross-border trade easier by reducing the number of documents required to import and export, improved the regulatory framework for credit reporting, and strengthened minority shareholder protections. Trinidad and Tobago, among the ten top improvers worldwide in this years report, made resolving insolvency easier by introducing a new restructuring proceeding. It also strengthened the rights of secured creditors during reorganization procedures. And it made starting a business easier by introducing online systems for employer and tax registration. Such reforms are leading to tangible benefits for entrepreneurs. For example, starting a business now takes 11.5 days for an entrepreneur in Trinidad and Tobagoon par with international best practicedown from 35.5 days in 2013, the report said. Entrepreneurs in the Caribbean continue to see gains in the business environment. With half the regions economies making regulatory reforms in the past year, the Caribbean continues to move in the right direction, said Rita Ramalho, Doing Business report lead author, World Bank Group. Yet while the region continues to reform, there is still room for further improvement in the business environment. The report this year expands the data for three of the ten topics covered, and there are plans to do so for five more topics next year. In addition, the ease of doing business ranking is now based on the distance to frontier score. This measure shows how close each economy is to global best practices in business regulation. The report finds that Singapore tops the global ranking on the ease of doing business. Joining it on the list of the top ten economies with the most business-friendly regulatory environments are New Zealand; Hong Kong SAR, China; Denmark; the Republic of Korea; Norway; the United States; the United Kingdom; Finland; and Australia. The Caribbean region includes the following economies: Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. About the World Bank Group The World Bank Group plays a key role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. It consists of five institutions: the World Bank, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA); the International Finance Corporation (IFC); the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Working together in more than 100 countries, these institutions provide financing, advice, and other solutions that enable countries to address the most urgent challenges of development. For more information, please visit www.worldbank.org, www.miga.org, and ifc.org. About the Doing Business report series The annual World Bank Group flagship Doing Business report analyses regulations that apply to an economys businesses during their life cycle, including start-up and operations, trading across borders, paying taxes, and resolving insolvency. The aggregate ease of doing business rankings are based on the distance to frontier scores for ten topics and cover 189 economies. Doing Business does not measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to firms and investors. For example, it does not measure the quality of fiscal management, other aspects of macroeconomic stability, the level of skills in the labor force, or the resilience of financial systems. Its findings have stimulated policy debates worldwide and enabled a growing body of research on how firm-level regulation relates to economic outcomes across economies. Each year the report team works to improve the methodology and to enhance their data collection, analysis and output. The project has benefited from feedback from many stakeholders over the years. With a key goal to provide an objective basis for understanding and improving the local regulatory environment for business around the world, the project goes through rigorous reviews to ensure its quality and effectiveness. This years report marks the 12th edition of the global Doing Business report series.

They help us to understand the priorities of government by affording us a look at spending patterns. On the other hand, there are many strategic moves that a government can take which have little or nothing to do with budgets, or which budgets only imperfectly capture. I suspect however that national budgets in Trinidad and Tobago are this important because they occur in an information vacuum. Since we hardly have any other information about government plans, we grasp at the budget as would a drowning man clutch at a straw. Until better comes therefore, the nation will remain riveted to the media to understand what lies ahead. Already significant because it is the first budget of the new government, it is doubly important because it tells us a lot about how we are going to weather the rest of the slowdown and the pathway we propose to take to get us to safer ground. The government has gone to some lengths to engage stakeholders, and has made several bold moves on a number of fronts (e.g. Alutrint, rapid rail, criminal court), while remaining somewhat vague on others. While the specific aspects of the budget have already been dissected in the media, there are some other things worth thinking about. I was wondering how the government would balance the budget or get close to doing so. The answer, as it turns out, was not to try to. While this makes sense in the short term, because we do not want to collapse the economy, the budget needs to be balanced quickly if we are to avoid the problems attendant to persistent deficit spending. Spending in this budget appears aimed at managing the impact of the economic slowdown on middle and lower income households. As such, the budget at first reading did not spell out an entirely new direction but rather outlined the places that we will definitely not go. So out are smelters and massive rail projects, for example. What will happen to the people in the La Brea region is less clear, but perhaps the government will treat with that in the debate to come. The theme of the budget is 'turning the economy around'. However, it does have more of the overtones of a bailout or clean up budget. If this is a turnaround budget, we are definitely not yet at the point where we stop the bleeding, having instead as it were, to spend more now to avoid spending more later. High on the agenda for help were CLICO and, more surprisingly, the HCU. My view is that Finance Minister Winston Dookeran approached these issues as sensibly as could be done in the circumstances. If CLICO has cost the taxpayer $7.3 billion so far, this approximates to the entire deficit of the previous budget. It was a catastrophic meltdown which inflicted a considerable blow on the public purse. The hemorrhage continues, and if the government were to bail out everyone, then we would go bust in a heartbeat. The cruel fact is that many depositors were chasing above-average returns, and should have to bear the pains such investment moves sometimes bring. The HCU deserves help on a principled basis. The argument that HCU did not threaten the stability of the financial system and therefore did not deserve some help was clearly unsound, particularly given the regulatory weaknesses that failed so spectacularly to protect depositors. I therefore think that an argument can be made to help these people. The only difference between the HCU and CL was size, and this is at best an imperfect justification for intervention in one and a hands-off approach with the other. However, it does somewhat establish the precedent that the government will protect depositors whenever a financial institution goes bust. Nothing wrong with that, but then we need far more sophisticated oversight of the credit union sector, and should pay special attention to the several credit unions that are in an extremely unhealthy financial state as this article is being written. Further, if the public must bail out those who have taken greater risk, then certainly the level of statutory deposits must increase, and the proposed rates of returns adjusted downwards accordingly. Finally, the part I liked best about Mr Dookeran's speech had to do with the consequences of these failures. Those responsible at these organisations should be held to account. At least some should be in jail, and all should be debarred from holding other positions. Their Audit Committees should have to answer for their ignorance of the impending failure which nearly capsized our economy and certainly capsized the lives of many people. The budget speech said that action would be taken. It remains to be seen how the issue of prosecuting some of their own supporters, who may have featured prominently in these meltdowns, will be worked out. Education The education system has received the largest chunk of funding from the budget. This is of course laudable and it represents an investment in our future. Yet a view of the education landscape reveals spotty progress and at the tertiary level, it looks like the Wild, Wild West. The problem with our education system begins, but is not restricted to our primary schools. We aren't doing a good enough job there, and too few pass SEA. The secondary school bottleneck isn't helping, and each year too many of our youngsters are ejected from the system, often to join the criminal underworld at very young ages. The expansion of GATE to cover vocational training (which saves some of these very people later on) is laudable. However, the tertiary system is in disarray and needs badly to be consolidated. The provision of GATE funds to for-profit institutions is of questionable logic, if not integrity. The kind of education Trinidad and Tobago needs requires researchers, not merely teachers. These are not easily built in the private sector because academic research costs money with often little or no economic payback. When we extend a 50 per cent GATE subsidy to private institutions that offer degrees from unknown universities, we are merely lining the pockets of entrepreneurs who have spied and taken advantage of an opportunity presented by a shortage of public spaces. The solution is to expand the public system, or encourage charitable public-private partnerships, not to subsidise the profits of private institutions led by people seeking profit. Of course, these entrepreneurs would disagree. They have honed their arguments and cultivated their political contacts over the years to ensure they get better slices of the GATE pie. But how many researchers have they produced What contribution have they made to the advancement of the reputation of Trinidad and Tobago as a knowledge-driven country This is important because Trinidad and Tobago is becoming an innovation-driven economy and new knowledge matters. Profit isn't evil. It is good. And entrepreneurship is to be encouraged everywhere, including the education system. But state subsidies to the extent that GATE offers should not go so easily into the hands and pockets of private, for-profit institutions. National Security The $1,000 tax free duty allowance is a good start. Crime and theft should now be critically addressed, since these represent the single greatest challenge to business and entrepreneurship in Trinidad and Tobago according to the recent Global Competitiveness Report. The manpower problem in the Police Service should be partially resolved with the shrinking of the Army and retraining of soldiers. Crime poses a greater threat to national security than invasion (which we cannot repel even at full Army strength). We should have the courage to redistribute these resources. Note, Costa Rica has no army and the State has not collapsed. The logic of Lord Mountbatten that we should be able to provide some token resistance against invasion, and the use of this as a qualifying factor for independence should no longer apply. The big-spending SAUTT should be put under the control of the TTPS. It is alarming that such an organisation could continue to be left to its own devices, under the complete control of politicians, without any kind of oversight. The intelligence and training capabilities of SAUTT should therefore be brought into the TTPS and wages and salaries harmonised. CEPEP and URP The recent charm offensive by CEPEP was well done. However, a new coat of paint doesn't change the beast in the slightest and these programmes need to be changed. Specifically, CEPEP needs to be refocused into something productive like agriculture. We need to change our approach from cutting things down to growing them. The URP meanwhile, is a mystery. Trinidad and Tobago has a lower unemployment level than the US and many other developed countries. Yet, URP (which stands for Unemployment Relief Programme) is going strong. How could this be Where is the unemployment problem that this programme is meant to alleviate The private sector is starved for low-end staff to help drive the entrepreneurial engine of the economy. If government is serious about entrepreneurship, these workers should be redeployed instead of being left to lives of low productivity or to fill criminal gangs, both of which make them unemployable later on. Overall, I would say that given the state of the economy they inherited and the time this government had, the budget was a very good effort. It fell short of the austerity measures it might have contained. But it has done its best to soften the blow and to take pragmatic (eg exploration incentives, tax amnesty) and obvious (eg police allowance, special court) steps to change course even if the new route is not yet fully charted. We will have to wait not only for the debate but for the next budget, next year, to perhaps get a fuller picture.

This description incurred the wrath of the Government. One Minister, Jack Warner, saw something nefarious in the fact that the Governor had released his report on the eve of the People's Partnership's second anniversary celebrations. Finance Minister, Winston Dookeran, for his part, hastened to deny that the economy was in a slump. As far as he was concerned the accurate description of the state of the economy is that \\\"growth prospects may have slowed but we are still in recovery mode.\\\" It is perhaps understandable that the Governor of the Central Bank may wish to couch his description of the economy in the most circumspect of terms so as not to give offence to the Government. And we know that the politicians, even those who were once economists, are mortally afraid of giving bad news to the electorate. So between the two we end up with statements which serve only to confuse and obfuscate our economic reality. So what is the true reality of our economy and how can we translate the jargon of the economists and the obfuscation of the politicians into language which the ordinary citizens can understand Let us start from the fact, which neither economist nor politician can deny, that our economy has experienced three consecutive years of economic decline, and even the prediction of very modest growth in 2012 is problematic and may not be realised. What does this mean It means that for each of those three years not only did the economy not grow but in fact it produced less than it did the year before. Now strictly speaking that is not a slump. The term \\\"slump\\\", in economic jargon, usually refers to a sudden decline in business or stock market activity. Three consecutive years of economic decline can hardly be described as \\\"sudden\\\". After three years of decline the more accurate term to describe the economy is \\\"stagnated\\\". The next question, of course, is why is economic growth important Economic growth is the increase in the amount of goods and services produced by the economy. It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in gross domestic product (GDP) which is the market value of the total of goods and services produced by the economy. The importance of economic growth is that it is the necessary condition for achieving an increased standard of living for the population. With an increased production of goods and services people can benefit from consuming more goods and services. The government, through increased tax revenues, can spend more on important public services such as health and education. By stimulating greater investment economic growth helps to reduce unemployment by creating jobs. More jobs means less social problems such as crime and poverty. Now economic growth by itself does not necessarily bring all these benefits. Whether it does depends in large part on attendant governmental fiscal and social policies. But what is certain is that where there is no economic growth these benefits cannot be realised and with prolonged economic decline the standard of living of the population is certain to be reduced and the social problems such as crime and poverty will increase. The next question is why is our economy stagnant and in decline The answer is that growth in our economy has always been dependent almost exclusively upon the energy sector. This sector generates over 90 per cent of exports and foreign exchange and more than 50 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and government revenue. It is these revenues from the energy sector which, when spent by the government, drive the economic activity and growth in the so-called \\\"non-energy sector\\\". Indeed it is something of a fallacy even to say that 50 per cent of our GDP comes from the \\\"non-energy\\\" sector. For without the government expenditure which derives from the energy sector revenues the so-called \\\"non-energy sector\\\" will swiftly shrink almost to insignificance. But the energy sector, upon which so much of our economic activity depends, is not within our control. In the first place the sector is dominated by transnational corporations which use international enterprise, capital and technology to exploit our indigenous natural resources for their global operations. Second, the prices obtained for these resources, which in turn determine the revenues the government obtains, are set by international market forces over which we have no control and finally, the resources of this sector are depleting assets which require huge dollar investments, which we do not have, to find and generate. Our current economic stagnation and decline therefore stems directly from the fact that after a period of very high international oil and gas prices which obtained from 2002 to 2007, prices of these commodities declined precipitously in 2008 with a consequential significant decline in government revenues. Furthermore, even prior to 2008, the energy sector had been in a state of decline both in terms of production levels and new investments. Oil production has declined from 130,000 barrels a day in 2002 to some 90,000 barrels a day, currently. As far as gas is concerned the situation is even more critical. Not only are gas prices still very depressed, but the country's reserves to production ratio is now less than ten years. This means that at current production rates we won't have any gas in ten years and all the huge petrochemical industry which was created based on the availability of cheap natural gas will shut down. What all of this means should be clear. Government revenues are going to remain depressed for the foreseeable future and are likely to decline even further as the contraction in the so-called non-energy sector continues. As government revenues continue to fall its current levels of expenditure on transfers and subsidies are going to become, even with increases in the national debt, unsustainable. When that time comes no one will need to explain to the population the truth of our economic reality.

It may have a lot to do with the planned construction of the Mitsubishi methanol to petrochemicals plant. In June 2012, the government recieved a proposal from the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan for a methanol to petrochemicals project. The US$800 million plant is a major investment, construction is expected to begin in the second quarter of next year. It is expected to add a further boost to the economy. Howai says the local economy continues to grow and overall will be very robust and strong in 2014. The non-energy sector particularly has been very encouraging for us, the non energy sector has actually grown at a rate of 2.5 per cent which is a strong rate of growth in todays economy, said Howai. The growth in the non energy sector has been able to offset the downturn we experienced in the energy sector because the energy sector itself has been experiencing a downturn as a result of the maintenance works that have been taking place in that sector, we had a major turnaround which resulted in significant reduction in the output of the energy sector but overall the economy has continued to grow and we expect next year to show an even stronger rate of growth because most of the maintenance work has been completed in the energy sector, we expect the non-energy sector to continue to grow and once the global economy continues to hold up, we expect that the performance of the overall economy will be very strong and robust in 2014. Howai was speaking to a audience of customers and regulators at the Bank of Barodas sixth anniversary dinner celebrations at the Regent Star Hotel in Piarco last Wednesday night. One couldnt help but notice that the mood of everyone present appeared to be light and relaxed, perhaps that had a lot to do with the breaking news that flashed on TV screens everywhere earlier in the day which everyone was eagerly anticipating - United States President Barack Obama signed a law ending the 16-day partial government shutdown, extending the US debt limit. This latest news coming out of the US must have had Howai and economists breathing a sigh of relief. Were looking forward to good things next year, we hope the US will get past the shutdown of the government that occurred and we expect that this would happen in the next couple of weeks, certainly it will not go beyond the end of this month so that we hope that the US economy will be back on track we hope- during the course of next year which will keep a number of other economies moving and therefore the T&T economy will continue to benefit. Once those external factors are brought under control we feel reasonably comfortable that next year will be a strong year for the economy, said Howai. Howai also has words of commendation for the Bank of Baroda which he said was a solid addition to the family of financial institutions in T&T. Its an institution that has a long history, and deep roots, its a solid institution with over eight trillion rupees in assets, in TTD I think the profits last year would have been around $4.5 billion, so its a strong institution, very well capitilised, with very strong returns, its the second largest bank in India. Its an institution that has weathered good times and bad in India as well as in the global economy. And that is something that gives confidence to the government of T&T, said Howai. The Bank of Baroda (Trinidad and Tobago) Limited, is a subsidiary of Bank of Baroda, Indias International Bank with over 46 million customers, in 25 countries worldwide and has been successfully banking for more than 105 years and is owned and operated by the Government of India. Its first branch in T&T opened on October 2007, two more branches were opened on July 2009 in Chaguanas and San Fernando. The bank offers a full range of banking products in deposits, loans and advances, remittances, foreign exchange and NRI account services. Bank of Baroda is an Indian state-owned banking and financial services company headquartered in Baroda, or Vadodara in India. It offers a range of banking products and financial services to corporate and retail customers through its branches and through its specialised subsidiaries and affiliates in the areas of retail banking, investment banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its total global business makes it the second largest bank in India after State Bank of India. In addition to its headquarters in its home state of Gujarat, it has a corporate headquarters in the Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai. Based on 2012 data, it is ranked 715 on Forbes Global 2000 list. The bank was founded by the Maharaja of Baroda, H. H. Sir Sayajirao Gaekwad III in July 1908 in Baroda state in Gujarat. The bank, along with 13 other major commercial banks of India, was nationalised in July 1969, by the government of India.

The priority non-energy sectors identified are financial services, tourism, information and communication technology, downstream energy industries, agriculture, creative arts, and 'the maritime sectors' seven of them. So how does the government plan to make these areas prosperous Let's choose one area, say financial services, and see what they have to say; it's on page 27. They are going to develop this sector in two ways. First, they are going to create a subsector the financial institution support services industry within the financial services sector, and this industry will launch the International Financial Centre (IFC), which will offer 'shared service centres' to national, regional, and international financial institutions. And secondly, they are going to introduce supportive legislation with tax incentives 'early in the new year', with their activities 'encapsulated in a strong legislative framework' that will be laid during 2013. The latter will include 'a new Securities Act, a new Insurance Act, and the Credit Union Act as well as legislation to effect electronic payments in the Government Services'. With these two 'initiatives', they expect the sector to 'generate substantial benefits': i) absorption of graduates from tertiary educational institutions; ii) provision over the next five years of '3,000 good quality jobs for knowledge workers; iii) on a multiplier effect basis, 6,000-12,000 total jobs'. The impact on GDP will be 'immediate and positive'. Finance Minister Howai tells us that the non-energy share of GDP stands at $30.6 billion, but that it needs to be increased to 66 per cent of GDP. I expected him, therefore, to quantify the result in dollars and cents to tell us how much of that sum he estimates the financial sector services will bring in. But he doesn't; he's content to speak in terms of 'substantial benefits', expressed in job creation terms. How serious can he be I ask. What about the other six priority areas Does he quantify their expected contribution to GDP Tourism: nope. We hear about the Ministry of Tourism and the THA 'increasing' their marketing and promotion programmes. We hear about the establishment of Trinidad and Tobago Business Development Ltd to administer the Tobago Development Fund, which will have an initial capital of $100 million and annual allocations of $50 million in 2013 and 2014. But no, no quantification of the contribution of tourism to GDP in dollars and cents. How serious can he be Information and Communication Technology: Yes Howai promises the building of a competitive ICT industry based on 'our strong tertiary education network, our sophisticated and competitive telecommunications infrastructure, our cheap and reliable electricity supply and our well-educated and capable work force'. But guess what He provides an estimate of the contribution of this initiative to GDP 6.7 per cent over the next five years, but he tells us that it is the World Bank, not he, who did the estimating. Shaking my head. Downstream energy industries (or 'Gasoline Vehicles Conversion to CNG): A big nope. Howai announces that the Government has developed 'a comprehensive business plan which will invest $1.5 billion in converting gasoline vehicles to compressed natural gas Really How's that scientifically possible over a five-year period initially, but there's nary a word on how the investment will translate into a contribution to GDP and in what amounts. Instead, he increases the price of premium gasoline from $4 to $5.75 per litre and hints at other increases of the price of super unleaded in 2013. Is he really serious about increasing the prosperity of the non-energy sector You get the picture It's more of the same for agriculture, creative arts, and the maritime sectors. Announcement of plans that are opaque as to their contribution to GDP, and yet the minister sets out to show us how these subsectors will be managed to grow the non-energy share of GDP. The offering of the Minister of Finance on this matter seems to be quite lazy and insincere. But I may be wrong: the estimates could very well come in the contributions of other ministers .

Dr Roger Hosein of UWI in his address to the Employers' Consultative Association's annual general meeting claimed our economy was suffering from the Dutch and Baumol diseases and was under the threat of shale gas production elsewhere. He saw the Dutch disease, the result of our plantation economy's dependence on the energy sector, which employs some three per cent of the labour force, provides 55 per cent of the Government's revenue and 86 per cent of our export income, as influencing higher wages and salaries in the non-energy sector and driving lower productivity in on-shore manufacturing. Dr Hosein also pointed to the impact of Government transfers and subsidies, which hinders the competitiveness of the on-shore sector since it manipulates the employment levels via make-work programmes that starve this sector of labour and increase its price, a characteristic of the Dutch disease. He recommends that we need to provide long-term sustainable jobs in the economy. How, one may well ask Dr Hosein was also concerned about our increasing debt and that our income from the energy sector is decreasing and is at risk due to shale gas in other countries. He questioned whether we could afford the current level of subsidies, e.g. in fuel and GATE. He was surprised that our government (not the private sector)had not yet addressed the problem of finding new markets or what our new exports should be or even the failure to address the threat of shale gas. Nicholas Lok Jack, new president of the T&T Manufacturers Association, sees that a labour shortage is a major problem for this sector. He also refers to government's employment make-work programmes and the sector's difficulty in competing with the government for these resources. According to him, in order to attract and keep workers the employers have to keep adding incentives and pay increases for what people are supposed to do for a basic wage\\u2014the Baumol disease. This drives up the cost of and is destroying the standard of living, increasing inflation again, causing people to demand more money. Both commentators also blame the artificial costs of traffic, port and custom inefficiencies for driving costs up. Lok Jack concludes that we have to look to the global economy since our growth in manufacturing is not going to come from the local and Caricom markets. This is an economist and a businessman just repeating the woes of the economic model that our history has bestowed upon us. The plantation/Dutch economy has imprinted its characteristics on our labour (low skills, high demands), on our government spending, subsidies, transfers to sustain the on-shore economy. The manufacturing sector, generally assembly type, is structurally hamstrung by the problems of low skills, low productivity and by the lack of local and global networking systems that include finance, innovation, marketing and market development. Fixing T&T is not an option. Our economy has to be reconstructed to take advantage of the current global threats, our opportunities. This means providing an economy that can access knowledge, implement it in new high-value products and services and create it (IP). The current on-shore economy is incapable of this on its own and requires an intervention by government, one that results in the building of an experimentally organised economy.

In fact, we invariably have several quarrels raging at any point in time over issues or personalities such that we go off on tangents, forgetting who or what was in dispute in the first instance. It is often said that you cannot please all the people all the time. With respect to Trinis, you cannot please anyone anytime. This characteristic is not to be confused with the proverb, \\u201cyou can fool all the people some of the time\\u2026but you cannot fool all the people all the time\\u201d. In this latter regard, you can fool all Trinis all the time: just inform them via e-mail that they have won the jackpot in a lotto they know nothing about, and you can relieve them of a \\u201cprocessing fee\\u201d. But back to our quarrelsome nature: before the row over the Tobago ferry could subside, we are barking and biting, pot hound-style, over the introduction of the revised property tax, which we knew would be implemented as far back as when the PNM won the election in 2015, and which we know is a standard form of taxation in most countries. Now, I should say up front that I believe Finance Minister Colm Imbert and those who are advising him in the exercise are playing the ox. The one-month window they have decreed for property owners to submit piles of documents to the Valuation Division for appraisal is unimaginably inadequate. Bearing in mind that citizens can be penalised for failing to comply, let me explain why I say Colm is an ox. Taxable properties under the law are residences, commercial, industrial and agricultural businesses, agricultural lands and other vacant, privately-owned lands. The State is exempt, which means that anyone who is squatting on State lands, whether he is operating a quarry or living in a shack, is not obligated to pay the tax. But you and I, law-abiding citizens, must comply. Which tells you what The law is an ass, and those who formulate it or rigidly enforce it are jackasses. Now, in the 2011 census exercise, the Central Statistical Office determined there were 401,000 residential households in the country. By now, that number might have risen to 450,000. Add, say, 50,000 commercial and industrial properties, and a minimum of another 100,000 parcels of land either vacant or agricultural, and you have a massive 600,000 property owners straining at the bits to board the Valuation Division. As readers may have guessed by now, valuation, which falls under the Ministry of Finance, has a grand total of nine offices! Yes, you read right\\u2014nine. And if we factor in under-staffing, subtract lunch hours and social media time, more than likely not more than 500 officials are being asked to accommodate 600,000 sets of documents in no more than 20 working days! Simple arithmetic ought to tell super-bright Colm (so his friends say) that we are talking about 30,000 transactions per day! Madness! The only Government agency that has such capacity is the NLCB, whose hundreds of Play Whe outlets cater for tens of thousands of gamblers every day. No other, not Inland Revenue, not the police, not the courts or the health system, even if they are combined, can handle such a flow of people. Mr Minister, you will need at least one year\\u2014and that is optimistic\\u2014to simply allow all property owners to submit their documents, and for valuation to commence appraisal where that is necessary. I note this latter because I am crediting officials at Valuation with having established some methodologies for applying the tax, hence not needing to physically assess all properties, a process that could take forever. I have no problem with having to pay property tax, once it's reasonable and fairly applied. While the timing of its implementation is not propitious, what with the depressed economy, many persons on the breadline, and generally people catching hell, it must be done at some time\\u2014if not now, when Government should offer deferment to retrenched workers who may have acquired homes when they were employed, but are currently under stress. They will not remain unemployed forever. Also, pensioners who will have worked long and hard to own modest homes, should be given consideration: maybe those who inherit their properties when they die can fulfil this obligation before taking possession. Property tax laws, unlike those that apply to incomes, profits and consumption, should be administered with a heart, if we can conceive of politicians and tax collectors having hearts. I cannot, however, agree with people who willingly pay higher taxes when they visit or reside in developed countries, but who insist on paying nothing in their native land. Such persons are aptly described in Sir Walter Scott's poem \\u201cPatriotism\\u201d: \\u201cBreathes there the man with soul so dead\\u2026Despite those titles, power and pelf\\u2026The wretch, concentrated all in self\\u2026shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung\\u2026\\u201d IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

But what exactly is causing this rally Economic data remains mixed and is yet to show any clear signs of recovery. Third quarter earnings reports from some of the biggest Wall Street banks show 'profits', but this was largely based on the reduction of loan-loss reserves. For most of 2010, the S&P has traded below the 1,180 level except during the month of April when the index rallied to hit a high of 1,217.28. This rally was backed by strong earnings reports and a surge in new-home sales seen during the month of March. With the market pricing in the expected second round of quantitative easing from the Fed and the 1,200 mark seemingly close on the horizon, it begs the question, is this rally justified Reports indicate that the recession which began in December 2007, lasted 18 months to end in June of 2009, marking the longest recession since World War 2. During that time, the S&P plummeted to a low of 676.53 in March 2009 as the recession deepened and investors became increasingly skeptical. The market has 'recovered' since that low, to end 2009 at a level of 1,115.10 marking a 23.45% gain for that year. Thus far, for 2010, the index has traded above the July low of 1,022.58 when the market sold-off in response to slow growth in manufacturing, an unexpected jump in jobless claims and a slump in new home sales. New home sales data, which has been volatile for the year so far, has had a strong impact on the stock market. After ending March at 1,169.43, the index rallied to 1,217.28 on 23 April on the news that the purchase of new homes in the US had its highest monthly surge in March with sales rising by 10.7% month-on-month. This represented the fastest single-month rate in 47 years as buyers rushed to snatch up properties to qualify for the government tax credit that was set to expire by the end of April. The rally in April was followed by two dips in the stock market seen at end-June and end-August consecutively as new home sales data was released for the months of May and July. The largest negative change was recorded in May with purchases down 31.9% for the month. This dip to 282,000 came soon after the expiration of the tax credit government programme and was exacerbated by a decline in retail sales and a slowdown in private job growth. The dip to follow in July, announced at end-August, showed a monthly decline of 8.1% in sales as the unemployment rate remained above the 9.5% level dampening consumer confidence leading to a plunge in home demand. September was the best performing month of the year for the S&P, yielding a return of 8.71% on the news that the recession which began in December 2007 ended in June 2009 and as the risk of a double-dip recession somewhat subsided. This rally in September was a boost to the S&P's third quarter performance which saw a 10.72% gain over the period to close at 1,141.20. At the time of writing, the market was up 3.41% in the 10th month of the year reaching 1,185.64, a level not seen since the rally in April. This 1,185.64 level was reflective of the slight increase in the consumer confidence index from September to October as the index climbed to 50.2 from 48.6, beyond the 50 level which signals an expansion. The question now is will the 1,200 mark be broken to end the year close to some analysts' forecasted '1,300 closing level' or will the market retreat to levels seen at the end of 2009 The stock market continues to react to a number of factors and fundamentals are yet to signal a strong recovery to consumer confidence which is reflective of consumer demand, the main driver of US growth. It has been argued that unless we see an improvement to the housing market, the downfall of which drove the US into recession, the risk of a double-dip recession still lingers. Unemployment is still high and new home sales remain at some of its lowest levels, rising mainly when the market is boosted by some sort of government support. It is obvious that government support offers short-term relief, but as we have seen, the market quickly retreats to 'pre-government support' levels as these assistance programs expire. The market is vulnerable and remains sticky upwards to the 1,200 mark, which, if it crosses can either lead to a strong uptrend or reverse as it did in April as weak economic data throws investors back into uncertainty and risk aversion. Past research shows that the stock market can act as a leading indicator for economic activity, and as highlighted in a recent article, can be based on a couple of fundamentals such as the wealth effect, a slowdown in IPO and equity financing, a plunge in pension plans and confidence. The wealth effect is reflective of consumer confidence which dwindles as the stock market declines and gives investors the impression of having less wealth to spend. This in turn dampens consumer demand and ultimately economic growth. IPO and equity financing can also slow as companies are deterred by the declining stock prices which inhibit company growth as there is limited access to capital. Declining stock prices also affect company portfolios which can have a direct effect on how businesses choose to organise their spending. The final point highlighted was that of confidence. The perception of economic policies is said to be reflected in the stock market both when positive and negative hence making the stock market \\\"directly related to broad confidence in the economy\\\". This in turn impacts consumer confidence and their level of demand for goods and services has a major effect on economic growth. Without a doubt, the US economy and the US stock market performance over the past 3 years have perturbed some analysts as usual 'trends' and 'effects' have been broken. Investors have become highly sensitive to data reacting strongly to any speculation in the market. With that said, giving a clear and accurate view on the market is no small undertaking and investing at this time is not for the faint-hearted. The outcome of the US mid-term elections and the minutes of the FOMC meeting will unquestionably have a strong impact on the market. A break through beyond the 1,200 mark on the S&P will send a strong signal to the market but investors should remain wary and ensure that economic fundamentals and the performance of the US Dollar support a bull run in the market.

He noted that in Trinidad and Tobago, there are about 18,000 SMEs, employing approximately 200,000 people or close to 35 per cent of the workforce and contributing near to 20 per cent of the gross domestic product. \\\"The SME is an important pillar for economic survival and growth in Trinidad and Tobago,\\\" he said. Following is the full text of Dookeran's presentation: \\\"A World of Uncertainty - Rebalancing of the Economy\\\" One year ago when the initiative was taken for a joint project between the Inter-American Development Bank and CariCRES, the world was somewhat a different place. We were at the height of much uncertainty, both globally and locally, but during the course of this year, as we are beginning to see the full depth of that uncertainty. What we are facing today is a rebalancing of the global economy, a rebalancing between deficit countries and surplus countries, a rebalancing between creditor countries and debtor countries, a rebalancing between strategies that depend on export growth and strategies that now depend on domestic demand. At first it appeared that this was a crisis that can be contained within the private sector and the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States and elsewhere suggested that we were dealing with a case of market failure. But it became clear that it was only the tip of the iceberg and, as we have seen over the last year, the issue has moved from the private sector to the public sector. The world is now engaged in the manifestation of that crisis through the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Greece, of course, being the prime example but there are many others. But even before we come to terms with the fact that the crisis has shifted from private sector to the public sector, it is now recognized that the crisis indeed affects the national economies and hence we have seen certain initiatives within recent limes that are responding to the national dimension of this crisis. Europe is trying once again to redo the integration model and to include the fiscal discipline that they felt was absent, A new diplomacy has developed on the issue of currency realignment and that diplomacy has been reflected by the global dynamics between China and the US, and in some sense we have come to the point now where the financing of development as opposed to growth has become the key issue. And therefore, it is appropriate that the Bankers Association took that step one year ago to prepare for the challenges of financing economic development. We must put aside what has turned out to be platitudes for diversification into real changes in the structures of the economy that will facilitate diversification. \\\"A New Direction is driving the Budget Strategy\\\" It is appropriate, therefore, for us to reflect on the underlining new directions of the budget strategy over the last two years. The first was widening our economic space, geographically, sectorially and from the point of view of human capability. That has been one of the pillars in changing the structures upon which this economy, so narrowly based, is to be changed. The second has to do with fixing the balance sheet and, more specifically, the public financial balance sheet which was at the risk of falling apart. The third was expanding the capital market. There is an underlying philosophical underpinning in the budget. We must move away from the lime when we look at our budgets as \\\"What I can get\\\" to a budget which can answer the question, \\\"What I can be\\\". That fundamental philosophical change is what we are using to set the new structures to achieve. It is in that context, therefore, that the role of entrepreneurship was put at the front burner so that we can articulate in concrete terms the change in philosophical direction from \\\"What I can get\\\" to \\\"What I can be.\\\" In the past it is fair to say, that budget exercises have been seen by all as \\\"What I can get from the State\\\". Our attempt therefore to restructure the expectations of the budget to what I can be is a much more difficult role and is one that will not succumb to shortterm political aspirations but to longer-term directional change. The role of entrepreneurship has become important, more important now than at any time. It is in that context that we can look at the outcome of some of the measures that have been put into place to change the structures of the economy. There's no doubt that our financial balance sheet has now been largely restored to a level of stability. There is no doubt that we have begun to think about investment, although, we have not yet seen the investment required for expanding the space of these economies across the region, within the country, and in the creation of new sectors. There's no doubt that in the process we have begun to see steps to strengthen the capital market. Expectations for change have been the political framework within which this Government began this journey for economic transformation, but there's no doubt that such expectations will indeed result in some anticipated pain. Such pain is, in fact, one of the political issues that must be faced as we grapple with the journey of realizing the new expectation not only for us but for times ahead of us. \\\"Steps in Transforming Structures of the Economy\\\" What we are engaged in is not only a quick fix solution to today's problem, but indeed a systematic change, a transformation in the structures upon which this economy will operate in the future. Part of this transformation clearly lies with the small and medium enterprises. This is one of the major pillars for growth creation in our country. There is no doubt that the small and medium-sized sector is significant worldwide. In Trinidad and Tobago, there are about 18,000 SMEs, employing approximately 200,000 persons or close to 35 per cent of the workforce and contributing near to 20 per cent of the gross domestic product. The SME is an important pillar for economic survival and growth in Trinidad and Tobago. What we must now do is build some new structures that will further support the efforts of the SMEs as the single sector that will generate employment in the short term. To do so we have engaged in a policy perspective on five major changes. \\\"Lending in Banking Sector\\\" The first has to do with the banking sector itself and we have argued that the focus of lending in the banking sector should shift, not to rely as heavily as it has done on debt financing of the Government for its profits but on loan financing to the private sector for its sustainability, and to do that we have had discussions with the private sector, with the banking sector and with the Tobago Chamber on the issue of derisking funding arrangements for the revival of the Tobago economy. Such measures are being worked out in light of the fact that Tobago has become the first area of vulnerability in the Trinidad and Tobago economy. Derisking, therefore, is an important new measure in the structure of financing of the banking sector. Much work needs to be done in this regard. \\\"Recapitalising State Enterprises\\\" The second area is to recapitalise the State Enterprises sector. Much of this sector has become inefficient, has not added value to the country's economy but remains a call on the public Treasury. To recapitalise this sector was announced in 2011, and further reinforced in the 2012 budget with our desire to move towards a public offerings programme. Public Offerings are not about privatisation. Public Offerings are about the distribution of the wealth of the country. It is about seeking efficiency measures. It is also about building the capital. \\\"Encouraging Growth for SMEs\\\" The third area in building new structures is to reignite the capital market and its growth for SMEs and you will recollect in the budget we introduced an additional window that will bring SMEs into direct opportunities for raising capital in the public by having what some refer to as a junior market and I hope that the stock exchange will accelerate its efforts to sell the idea as well as to make it happen, and that is part of the programme of recapitalising or reigniting the expansion of the capital market. \\\"Refocusing on Fiscal Discipline\\\" The fourth area is refocusing on fiscal discipline. Fiscal discipline at the national level is but a mirror of fiscal discipline at the enterprise level. To fix the fiscal discipline at the national level, can only be sustained by fixing the fiscal discipline at the enterprise level. It is in this context that the rating agency is important. We are engaged in trying to build a new momentum and a new awareness of fiscal discipline. The time has come where our enterprises must meet the standards of fiscal discipline and be measured and assessed and used as the basis upon which growth will take place. \\\"Developing Private and Public Sector Partnership\\\" The fifth area in changing the structures ahead of us has to do with the creation of the platform of private/public sector partnerships. It is a new dimension to financing. In the past we have been accustomed with public sector financing through its Public Sector Investment Programme, either directly from central government or with central government and state enterprises. In the past we have depended heavily on private sector financing of investment proposals for themselves and for our country. The lime has come to find a new partnership between private sector and public sector financing. We must find new ways and models by which we can share the risk, so that the private sector can get the returns and the public sector can reap the dividends on behalf of the people. This is, in Trinidad and Tobago, a somewhat new direction. We are currently engaged in working out the modalities of private/public sector financing. We hope that the banking sector will get very much involved in this particular dimension of financing development for, through them, we can add better access to financing SMEs. These, therefore, are some of the fundamental steps that have been taken in order to provide the new structures upon which SMEs growth can depend. These steps begin to address in a systematic way this new way of financing economic development. In so doing, we must of course build a new confidence that these new structures are sustainable in the future and are, in fact, going to meet the demands of today's population. \\\"Maintaining and Increasing Levels of Employment\\\" It is therefore important, in designing our investment plans, to ensure that we maintain, if not increase, our employment levels. In our current national environment this can only be achieved at the enterprise level. Careful thought must now be given to all enterprises in the new structure to maintaining and increasing employment levels. \\\"Increasing Profitability\\\" Especially in today's world, it is also important to have deliberate strategies for a more competitive environment, and to find ways and means to increase one's productivity. The profitability of the national economy is dependent on the profitability and as well as the enterprises in that industry. \\\"Ease of Doing and Operating Business\\\" The third area focuses on changes required to make it easier to do business and operate business in Trinidad and Tobago. We have engaged the International Financial Corporation of the United States, a private sector arm of the World Bank, to work with us and devise ways and means to make it easier to do business in Trinidad and Tobago. The indicators of doing business need to be improved. These are changes must take place rather quickly. \\\"Conversion of Financial Liquidity Economic Development\\\" In terms of growing confidence, we must convert the financial liquidity existing in the banking sector to production and income. The existence of excess financial liquidity does little to advance the economic development of Trinidad and Tobago. Prudent use of such liquidity is absolutely essential and, in that sense. What we engage in today would add to our ability to use in a most prudent way, to ensure that it is sustainable for the future. It must be converted into production and income. \\\"Participation of Business Community in Economic Development\\\" Public policy is but one complement to economic development momentum. Beyond public policy lie the decisions of the wider community, the banking sector, investors sector, small and medium enterprises sector, credit agencies. It is a combination of all working in the same direction. It will allow us to begin to change the structures so that we can truly say we are on the path of real transformation. It is going to be a long road but it is a road that we cannot afford not to start it is a road that we must be engaged in if we are to achieve a sense of confidence for the next generation.

The year closes amidst heavily overcast conditions, much the way it began. In its latest Monetary Policy announcement (November 29), the Central Bank paints a bleak picture of severe contraction in the production sub-sector of the energy sector in the third quarter; high liquidity in the banking sector; and a contraction of borrowing by the business sector for the tenth consecutive month last September. According to the Bank, large-scale maintenance works in both upstream and downstream energy resulted in a sharp 4.0 per cent contraction, year-on-year. The Bank proffers that with maintenance works coming to an end, oil and gas production, and operations at downstream plants, should return to normal levels by 2014. Just what are normal levels, however, remains debatable at this time. Daily oil production (crude and condensate) seems stuck at around 80,000 barrels, sometimes declining below that, for more than a year. A few years ago, 100,000 bopd was considered normal. Are we likely to see a return to this level anytime soon While there are vigorous exploration and secondary recovery activities offshore and onshore, and some new wells are coming into production, nothing suggests a quantum leap soon from the current levels. Worse, this sluggish performance that some might label post-peak oil is happening when prices are buoyant. From this perspective, the countrys opportunity losses are enormous. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the economy, the picture is gloomy. Liquidity in the banking system remains stubbornly high. According to the Central Bank, commercial banks excess reserves reached a record daily average of $8.4 billion in September, and averaged $7.8 billion for the year. This huge sum of money is floating around after at least two billion-dollar bond issues by the Bank, a one billion-dollar bond by Nipdec that was over-subscribed, and a billion-dollar initial public offer (IPO) of shares by State-owned First Citizens that was also over-subscribed. In other words, concerted efforts to mop up excess liquidity in the banking system have failed to reduce idle capital. Curiously, last week Central Bank Governor Jwala Rambarran and Finance Minister Larry Howai travelled to North America to promote the issuance of a sovereign bond in the sum of US$500 million. Government has not explained what it hopes to achieve by this initiative. Even as commercial banks remained flush with cash, chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce, Catherine Kumar, pointed to disincentives to investment in the country, hence the paucity of projects in the commercial sector. There are two multi-million-dollar commercial complexes under construction in South Trinidad, but little else of significance. Ms Kumar listed the disincentives as uncertainty in the face of four elections and intense politicking during the year, continuing high crime, government bureaucracy, and an aversion to risk by commercial banks. On this latter score, Ms Kumar noted that small and medium enterprises that are more likely to invest in new projects encounter difficulties as they seek financing from banks, in spite of the banks holding excessive liquidity. The economic indicators are not all negative as we approach year-end. In the twelve months to October 2013, headline inflation slowed to 2.7 per cent, with food inflation much lower than it was one year ago. Consumer lending remains robust, with increases in motor vehicle loans, home renovations and debt consolidation. Overall, though, the economy is experiencing growth pains. While a 1.5 per cent growth for 2013, if we achieve that, could signal a turnaround of sorts, sluggishness in the vital energy sector for the fourth consecutive year is worrisome. For how much longer can the banks continue to thrive off fees and charges when they are swamped with billions of dollars in excess liquidity unmatched by investment loans With minimal activities in commercial construction and investments of any significance, the country seems to be in a state of stasis.

The guide highlights key information on Trinidad and Tobago, such as the economy, services, infrastructure, and the opportunities for investment. At a ceremonial handover hosted by the bank at Chaud Restaurant in Port of Spain, Maharaj commented on what he described as the \\\"sea of change we are witnessing in the global economy\\\" and what countries like Trinidad and Tobago needed to do to effectively compete for business. Following is an excerpt of Maharaj's presentation: First of all, the emerging and developed countries are gradually decoupling from one another. Emerging markets growth no longer depends on growth in developed economies and sometimes even continues strongly when developed markets are in recession. Second, emerging markets are growing much faster. They suffered less from the Great recession and recovered more quickly, Today China is back near ten per cent annually and India is close to eight per cent, for instance. I don't need to tell you how bad the growth figures are right now for the developed world. The US economy grew less than half a per cent in the first quarter of 2011 and just above one per cent in the second. The EU's numbers are even worse and the Japanese economy has actually shrunk for the past three quarters of 2011.The developed world is grappling with serious debt problems - both as a consequence of over-borrowing before the crash and long-term liabilities in popular pension, health care and other programmes. It is the general consensus that the developed nations will never again grow at anywhere near the clip that has become routine in the developing world. Research conducted by us has concluded that China and India will be the world's largest economies by around 2030. Such disparities would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. The developed markets drove world growth and the emerging markets hitched a ride. Not anymore. Now they speed off on their own. Third, the decoupling of the two economic zones is not only largely complete already, it is likely to be permanent. The biggest driver of this decoupling is the maturation of emerging markets and the consequent rise of intra-EM trade and capital flows. This is one of the most important economic trends of our time maybe the most important. Trade within the emerging markets has risen sharply from six per cent of total world trade to 13 per cent between 1995 and 2009. The advanced economies' share of global trade is now 65 per cent, down from 79 per cent in 1995 and this will continue. Fourth, the growing emerging market consumer base has the power to drive global GDP. Around the globe, millions of people rise above poverty and enter the middle class every year - by one estimate, some 70 million in 2009 alone. According to another estimate, by 2020, three-quarters of incremental consumer spending will come from emerging markets. If that estimate is correct, then by that year consumer spending in Asia will overtake North America to become the world's largest consumer bloc. To highlight the changes that have taken place, The Wall Street Journal ran an article last (month) headed \\\"Lessons in Humility\\\", and I quote: \\\"Who could have imagined that following the worst of the 1990s Asian financial crisis that in November 2011 the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William Dudley, would tell cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point: \\\"We can learn from the example of emerging nations that took the tough decisions necessary to emerge from past crises stronger, more competitive and better positioned ... \\\" \\\"Or that the sovereign debt of the US, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Japan would be downgraded while debt in Angola, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Peru would be upgraded.\\\" So that ladies and gentlemen, the point I want to leave you with is that a lot of the future growth is in the emerging markets and that Trinidad and Tobago is one of the emerging market countries that have much potential for growth. So, what are the factors that investors consider when they make a decision to invest in a country Some of these are political stability with a democratic elected government Economic stability and a well developed, domestic economy easily accessible to international companies A pro-business government who understands the development opportunities in finance, and other sectors of the economy An educated, efficient, and skilled labour force Predictable legal system, easily enforced Efficient public infrastructure, such as transport, schools, and healthcare Adequate technological capacity and country infrastructure From my vantage point where I manage fourteen countries where we have a physical presence for Citi, stretching from Bahamas to Ecuador, I would easily confirm that Trinidad & Tobago has most of the above and is one of the most attractive for investment in my region. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a simple fact that CAPITAL GOES WHERE IT IS WELCOMED AND REMAINS WHERE IT IS WELL TREATED. Within Citi, I compete for capital with the 110 countries we operate. Similarly all countries around the world are competing for capital and new investments so it is important that the Government and the private sector continue to play a key role in making Trinidad and Tobago competitively attractive.

Confidence in the global economy fell in Q3 2012 according to a worldwide survey of 2,500 finance professionals with 67 per cent of respondents now believing that the global economy is stagnating or reversing. Further analysis suggests that this latest fall in global confidence is due almost entirely to changing business fundamentals - such as demand, access to finance, prompt payment and inflation - as opposed to respondents' sentiment. Globally, the downturn is firmly focused on the real economy with small and medium sized enterprises being the worst hit. The 15th edition of the quarterly Global Economic Conditions Survey (GECS) undertaken by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), shows that for the Caribbeanonly 15 per cent of respondents reported confidence gains, against 40 per cent who reported losses. Just under a third (32 per cent) believed the global economic recovery was on track, while 62 per cent did not. Both measures of economic optimism were exactly in line with the average in non-OECD countries. Brenda Lee-Tang, head of ACCA Caribbean, said: \\\"The Caribbean has seen much instability, like the rest of the world, with economic conditions. But the islands have seen tourism boosts and growth in the oil and mining industries, which has seen government investment in the infrastructure of those countries. Being in close proximity to the US, this region is heavily influenced by the American economy and so to the effects of its sluggish recovery.\\\" One theme that emerges strongly from the survey is the interconnectedness of the global economy. Raef Lawson, IMA's vice president of research commented: \\\"The slowdown in Asia; the Eurozone debt crisis; and the sluggish US recovery all are feeding into each other and no region is unaffected. In fact, the degree to which movements in the GECs indices are synchronised between regions is uncanny.\\\" Survey editor Manos Schizas, senior economic analyst with ACCA said: \\\"This quarter has seen business confidence fall for all the right reasons. Around the world, and with few exceptions, the fundamentals of the business environment are deteriorating, and businesses are once again having the kinds of liquidity problems we thought we had put behind us.\\\" The Caribbean picture suggests that: Much of the tone for the third quarter in the region was set by the countries' relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Jamaica was unable to reach an agreement with the Fund that would release IMF loans, which in turn led to a sharp reduction in government spending. The prolonged uncertainty leading up to this (including the delaying of the Budget) hit investor sentiment and business confidence hard, while wage freezes have had an effect on demand. Meanwhile, currency devaluation has driven up fuel prices in Jamaica, driving up fuel prices. Officials in Barbados spent much of the third quarter of 2012 denying that they were going to seek IMF support or devalue the dollar. Tourism and commodities, the region's main exports, have generally grown. According to respondents, tourism rose in Bermuda but fell in Barbados. Guyana's mining sector and Trinidad and Tobago's oil industry have been expanding and both governments have ploughed some of their proceeds into investments in infrastructure.

Speaking last Tuesday at the post-Budget forum hosted by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Mr Dookeran pointed out that the financial system now had excess liquidity, so funding for new ventures should not be an issue. He also asserted that the fiscal regime provided support for investment and that measures had been introduced to improve export and import facilities. On these bases, Mr Dookeran held that business persons should have confidence in the economy. Nonetheless, the private sector was not, he complained, stepping up to the challenge of economic regeneration. \\\"Is it really an excuse, the fact that we are a risk-averse people and we are prepared to live on the profits of yesterday without attempting to create new sustainability for tomorrow\\\" he asked. There is some irony in this query from the Finance Minister, given that he has just delivered a Budget in which several billion dollars have had to be committed to clearing up the mess caused by the excessive risks taken by persons linked to the CL Financial group. The difference there, however, was that the principal players in that fiasco were not risking their own money, but that of policyholders who, for the most part, were middle-income citizens with salaried jobs. Business persons are by nature risk-takers, but the degree of risk they are willing to stand depends to a great extent on guarantees provided by the State. Such guarantees range from physical security to property rights to rule of law. In this sense, the State must be held to its responsibility to facilitate business activity and competitiveness, and to preserve a favourable investment climate. Certainly, however, it's up to T&T's economic movers and shakers to explain why so much commercial credit remains unused in local banks, with opportunity costs incurring to growth, job creation, and even exports. Is it indeed fear of risk, as the Finance Minister claims Or is it lack of confidence in the apparatus of the State Is it concern that the T&T economy remains at the mercy of international financial trends Or is it a cultural barrier in which business persons cannot move from the merchant mindset to the entrepreneurial one Any or all of these factors may explain the inertia in the private sector. But it is the existence and application of the entrepreneurial spirit and a make-it-happen drive that will make the difference for T&Tand it's not clear that enough of this is making itself felt.

Therefore, it requires the Minister of Finance to send signals by addressing some definite imperatives in his budget statement on Friday. In general, when subsidies are being provided by the State to an entity, it tells us that services are being made available below cost. It may be that certain social considerations might dictate that this be done. However, apart from this, providing services below cost generates a ten\\u00addency to encourage waste, a lack of competitive edge and a general lack of accountability. In this regard, Trini\\u00addad and Tobago has been a happy haven for subsidies. The suggestions which are made herein are therefore confined to a few areas which impinge significantly on the failure of Trinidad and Tobago to have an economy that is more self-sustaining. Here are some: 1. The fuel subsidy The case for elimination of fuel subsidies has been discussed extensively and accepted generally and, therefore, the Minister of Finanace should continue the programme of reducing subsidies on fuel by a further reduction of, say, 25 per cent, thus leading to their complete elimination in four to five years. 2. State enterprises The definition of a State enterprise, even though it happens to be owned by the State, implies that such an entity should be business-oriented and from which a profit is, in normal circumstances, to be expected. Unfortunately, in Trinidad and Tobago, there has arisen a plethora of State-owned entities, many of which have been created for two main purposes: a) as tools for employment creation, and b) to fill gaps in the economy which, it was felt, were not being addressed properly by private enterprise. Unfortunately, many of these enti\\u00adties have been making large demands on the public purse, with doubts being expressed as to whether the public interest demands their continuing exis- tence. Therefore, here is an area for serious consideration by the minister. 3. Utility and other service rates Utility rates have been stagnant for several years. Thus, water and sewerage rates have been unchanged since 1985, ie, over 30 years. What manner of management is this Here again, the Finance Minister should take the bull by the horns by addressing the matter of the mechanisms which have been put in place to ensure that \\u201cthe cost of providing services to the public is being met by revenues collected\\u201d. 4. Agriculture and agro-based industries This is one area where there ought to be an increase in subsidies. Pivotal must be action aimed at establishing viable agriculture-based industries, with the aim of employment creation and import substitution.

The largest downside risk is the fragile industrial climate which could contribute to work stoppages and possible retrenchment, putting a halt to any resurgence in economic activity. A general strike is the worst possible thing we could face at this time.\\\" Williams advised Government that it has to begin making tough decisions about its expenditure, including the wage bill. \\\"The bottom line is that you need to start bringing the public finances back into balance and you need to do that even while you keep your Public Sector Investor Programme going,\\\" he said. \\\"That means that you need to look at other elements of expenditure. One of the things we have avoided doing is to identify what elements of expenditure should be our focus.\\\" He said, \\\"You need to look at the non-energy revenue side and you also need to look at all other expenditures particularly the subsidies, the wage bill ... it is not an easy challenge and that is the kind of challenge that the US is facing now.\\\" He also warned that the current global financial uncertainty could have a negative impact on our own fragile investor confidence. \\\"The second downside risk is the global uncertainly that has come about as a result of the (US) downgrade combined with the current fragile state of our business confidence,\\\" he said. \\\"We need to wait and see whether what is happening in the US and in Europe will also drop a dampening over economic perception and behaviour in Trinidad and Tobago.

Speaking at the launch of the Tunapuna Partnership Council (TPC), at which he was designated the \\\"chief servant\\\" of the executive council which will oversee the work of the TPC, Dookeran said the dialogue was the start of the process of deepening democracy in governance. Reiterating the National Treasury was empty, he said the \\\"people's energy\\\" derived from the dialogue process will go towards filling the Treasury. In the past, Dookeran said, the officers in the previous administration claimed they held consultation with the people but, in effect, they did not listen to them. At the end of the so-called consultation process, they designed the programmes without the input of the people. Due to the lack of consultation, the Finance Minister said he recommended they change the name to the \\\"dialogue process\\\" to engage in a genuine dialogue with the stakeholders business, labour, civil society, households and young people. Dookeran issued an invitation to young people throughout the country to take part in the sessions on the way forward for the economy with the Government. The dialogue, he said, was part of the change process but change does not come swiftly. \\\"Change comes by doing, and doing is what I am accustomed to do\\\", he declared. The dialogue process, he said, was one of the first priorities of the Government to build transparency in the governance structure, get rid of the broken politics of the past and embrace new politics.

The latest decline as at June of this year showed that total cash balances had plummeted to $5.43 billion, a loss of $12.27 billion in only two years. The data is contained in a June 11 report by Finance Minister Winston Dookeran titled \\\"Report on the Nation's Business - the state of our finances and initiatives for future action\\\". The decline was primarily due to the \\\"generation of the fiscal deficits which began in 2008\\\", the report states. \\\"In simple terms, the government's balances in the Treasury declined substantially over the last two years as the previous administration sought to maintain its high expenditure levels in the face of drastically falling revenues,\\\" the Dookeran report noted. Over the 2009 fiscal year Trinidad and Tobago recorded its first deficit in seven years. This deficit amounted to $7.4 billion or 5.3 per cent of GDP as compared to a surplus of $12.1 billion of 7.8 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2008. The deficit was the direct result of declining oil prices which \\\"substantially trimmed\\\" government revenues without a concomitant decline in the level of spending by the previous administration, the report observed. \\\"A further overall deficit of $7.7 billion or 5.4 per cent of GDP is projected for this fiscal year. This trend towards fiscal deficits contributes significantly to the country's indebtedness and if it is not reversed urgently could result in the virtual mortgaging of several generations to come,\\\" the report warned. For the first time since the late 1980s, a recurrent fiscal deficit of $722 million has been projected for this fiscal year. \\\"This means that the country is now borrowing to finance recurrent expenditure which includes components such as wages and salaries, transfers and subsidies and interest payments,\\\" the report stated. \\\"If this situation is not curtailed, it poses tremendous downside risks for fiscal sustainability and debt management in the future. This is quite like borrowing to finance the government's capital programmes which create employment and generate economic activity.\\\" The Central Bank said recently that to finance the deficit, the former government increased its borrowings on the domestic capital market. Several public sector enterprises also increased their borrowings from the capital market as well as through loans from the banking system to finance an expansion in infrastructural investments, the Central Bank said in its recent Financial Stability Review. Low energy and petrochemical prices combined with a slackened export demand in the context of the global recession led to a fall in the value of total exports in the order of 50 per cent, the Bank said. The Dookeran report describes the current situation as \\\"challenging economic circumstances confronting policymakers in Trinidad and Tobago\\\". Dookeran suggests that in light of these challenges a new approach that will bring fresh ideas and new perspectives on how to respond to the current economic circumstances of the local economy is necessary. In this context his report has proposed the establishment of an Economic Development Board which will provide external and independent advisory inputs into the formulation of financial and economic policies to be pursued by government. The report also suggests that even as attention is focused on revitalising the economy, considerable effort must also be directed towards securing sustainable long term growth. Former People's National Movement (PNM) minister in the ministry of finance and former trade minister Mariano Browne said recently that the government borrowing level at 50 per cent of GDP while his party held office was well within acceptable international benchmarks which fall in the 50-60 per cent range and could be compared favourably with regional and other international economies at this time. For the record, the world has been in the grip of a recession occasioned by a financial crisis which originated in the world's largest economy, the USA. As a result of this international financial crisis, governments everywhere have attempted to reflate their economies by the use of deficit financing. This is a well accepted macro economic technique and agreed to by various international agencies (the IMF for example) who were consulted (by the TT government) prior to the adoption of this specific strategy, he said.

This current regime assumed office with the assurance that the nation's business will be conducted with more transparency and less corruptly than any previous administration. Why then was it necessary for the Central Bank Governor\\u2014presumably an \\u201cindependent\\u201d official\\u2014to consult with the Finance Minister before issuing statements to the public One can only assume the Finance Minister wanted the opportunity to manipulate the information to suit political expediency. And what's wrong with the Central Bank Governor's disclosure regarding the allocation of US dollars Was there something to hide Was there political interference to favour one business over another The resources of this country belong to the people and we have a right to know. Besides, secrecy breeds and suggests corruption. Recent statements by the Finance Minister served not only to undermine the Government's initial stance regarding the economy, but has sent mixed signals to the population. To a large degree, the citizenry had implicitly accepted the Government's rationale that, like the rest of the world, our economy had contracted and some degree of austerity measures was necessary. Among the measures were salary cuts at State enterprises starting with the National Gas Company. Surprisingly, the trade unions did not rant and rave. They too have seemingly accepted the Government's position.

It formed part of his request for approval of Government expenditure supplemental to the 2014 National Budget. Howai explained that when he first presented the 2014 Budget last year, he had announced total expenditure of $61,397.9 million and Revenue of $55,040.8 million, resulting in an overall projected deficit of $6,357.1million or 3.6 per cent of GDP. In his presentation of the Supplementation and Variation of Appropriation Bill recently, Minister Howai revealed that despite the projected increase in Expenditure by $3,820.6 million, there is also a projected increase in Revenue of $4,525.5 million that will in fact result in a significant decrease in the projected deficit. The projected net savings amounts to $500 million more that had been anticipated in September 2013. Saying that the economy was robust, Howai cited similar projections by Moodys Investor Services forecast of 2.9 per cent growth of the economy as well as the forecast by the International Monetary Fundof 2.5 per cent growth in the economy of Trinidad and Tobago. Minister Howai quoted figures to show that the non-energy sector had grown approximately 2.5 per cent on average over the last six quarters and as a result of the initiatives which the government is putting in place, the country can expect this growth to actually accelerate towards the end of 2014. Pointing to figures received from the Ministry of Planning and Sustainable Development which show unemployment at 3.7 per cent,Howai noted that this was the lowest in the countrys history. He also spoke of the over 13,000 new businesses registered in 2013 as a sure sign of growth and confidence in the local economy. Howai added that Investor confidence is high both locally and internationally, with Trinidad and Tobago ranked sixth in Latin American and the Caribbean to receive Foreign Direct Investments for 2012. While overall foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Central America and the Caribbean fell by 17 per cent in 2012 compared to 2011, Foreign Direct Investments coming into T&T grew by 38 per cent over the same period, according to figures from the World Investment Report 2013 released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The total FDI flowing into T&T in 2012 was US$2.527 billion, the highest since 2008 when RBC of Canada re-acquired RBTT for US$2.2 billion. FDI flows into T&T in 2011 totalled US$1.831 billion. It was US$549 million in 2010 and US$709 million in 2009. The pre-crisis annual average for T&T was US$884 million between 2005 and 2007 (Source: UNCTAD). He said: Headline inflation continues to trend downward. The latest figure for April showed inflation at 3.5 per cent and core inflation which excludes food prices decelerating to two per cent at the end of last year. Food inflation, which dipped to an annual low of three per cent in September last year, was the main impetus behind the reduction in the rate of growth of headline inflation. The countrys balance of payments continue to be healthy, registering a surplus of US$226.8 million for the first nine months of the year, and it is estimated to have closed the year with an even larger surplus of $786.3 million for 2013. As a result, gross international reserves have climbed to over US$10 billion equivalent to 12 months import cover. He presented these facts and figures on the economy as a precursor to his Finance Supplementation and Variation of Appropriation Bill 2014. The Bill brought Governments request for additional funds in the sum of $3,820,601,879 to fund urgent and critical expenditure to September 30, 2014 to the House for approval. Of this figure some $1.02 billion goes towards the payments of salaries, NIS COLA, allowances, stipend, travelling, subsistence and arrears for Public Servants. This includes the settlement of the Collective Agreement for over 20,000 Daily Paid Workers. $1.6 billion is scheduled to go towards Infrastructure Development including such major improvement projects as the Diego Martin and Point Fortin Highways to bring relief to hundreds of thousands of commuters in north and south Trinidad, it was stated.

Our economy is slowly grinding to a halt and we need your intervention to change this trajectory. Let's examine the facts everyone said after the budget was passed in 2010, and again in 2011, things would start moving again. Even the IMF advisers approved a US$1.3 billion loan for Winston Dookeran to spend on projects to get the economy moving. Did anyone see any new projects other than the South highway start in 2011 Toward the last quarter of 2011, we had both the president of the Chamber of Commerce and the president of the Manufacturers Association complaining about the lack of stimulation of the economy. We keep hearing the mantra from the Finance Minister that we have no funds available for this, but why did the Central Bank Governor ask how come the Current Account showed a surplus $2 billion instead of the $7 billion deficit we were supposed to be posting The implication was: there were funds to invest in capital projects, which was not done! Even Mr Dookeran embarrassingly admitted in Parliament in January that he indeed had a $2 billion surplus... the Central Bank Governor was right. The brutal fact is we had negative growth in 2011... guess who got screwed Ask the 25,000 construction workers who lost their jobs during this period. Here we are in 2012, once again the budget was approved, with even an addendum of a further $3 billion tacked on... will this be dj-vu Already a no-confidence motion was brought up in Parliament, with a major part of the reason being the weakness of our economy. To make matters worse, ask some of the 200 contractors who have had their vehicles and businesses re-possessed due to Education Facilities Co Ltd (EFCL)'s non-payment of their invoices (valued roughly at $170 million) for work done, but not paid for. Don't forget the ripple effect this has on the construction employees and their families, hardwares and others who these contractors have not been able to pay. Madame Prime Minister, the fastest way to stimulate any economy is via construction. You should chair the Project Implementation Committee, where meetings are held on a weekly basis, to fast-track these projects. Alternatively, I would re-assign Mr Dookeran to another ministry and appoint Vasant Barath Finance Minister. This man knows how to get things done. My comments here are not meant to embarrass anyone, but are made out love for my country and with a genuine concern to help get our country back on a vibrant development path once again. If nothing is changed, we will end up with negative growth once again, with all the unnecessary human suffering and tragedy which goes hand-in-hand with non-action.

The Express sought the opinions several stakeholders in South and Central on the Government's performance so far. Some complained, others praised. But they all agreed on one thing. Much more work needed to be done. Richie Sookhai: 7/10 President of the Chaguanas Chamber of Industry and Commerce (CCIC), Richie Sookhai, said the Chamber was grateful for positive changes in Chaguanas, including having the Ministry of Agriculture's head office there instead of Port of Spain. But there were several concerns. He said: \\u201cThe CCIC remains concerned over the abrupt and unannounced drawing down of funds from the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund and the failure, so far, of the Government to produce other promised financing to deal with our growing debt. The CCIC also remains concerned about the difficulties faced by small businesses with the changes in VAT.\\u201d \\u201cIt is our hope that the budget plans for the 2017 financial year will reflect better incentives for the growth and scope of business so that our stagnating economy can finally get the kick-start that it desperately needs from the Government. \\u201cCrime continues to plague our nation. In Chaguanas we are hoping that Government will finally make the urgent decision to introduce the wide use of CCTV (closed- circuit television) cameras in the borough and ensure that they are connected to the national grid so that we can have some level of monitoring and control.\\u201d There should be at least one E-teck park in Chaguanas in order to stimulate economic growth. His grade for the Government out of ten (one being the lowest and ten the highest): seven. Joseph Rahael: 5/10 Developer for South Park shopping centre Joseph Rahael said Government has not yet done anything outstanding and much more needs to be done in order to boost the economy. He said: \\u201cOne of the things they (Government) ought to be focusing on is making life easier for the private sector to continue doing what we do, which is positive contributions to the economy and the society through our business, our commerce.\\u201d Measures should be in place to make business transactions and processes more efficient \\u201cso that the private sector can rely on these agencies for better output and better productivity,\\u201d he said. The Government got a grade five from him. Rahael added: \\u201cClearly they have been doing what they can do to keep the country going with very limited resources because of what is happening in the oil and gas sector. I will give them a fair grade for that but they could be doing a lot more. They need to push a lot harder on the diversification away from the oil and gas and make life easier for the business people and for commercial people to do those things, to do the diversification.\\u201d Shiva Roopnarine: 5/10 President of the Penal/Debe Chamber of Commerce Shiva Roopnarine said: \\u201cThe inheritance of an empty treasury and low revenues in oil and gas should not be an excuse for the shortage of medication on CDAP along with other essential commodities in the health sector. The chamber can support the completion of the much-anticipated Tarouba Stadium, but not at the expense of the health of the nation. The Government needs to urgently prioritise expenditure in the interest of the country\\u201d. Roopnarine gave the Government five out of ten. He said: \\u201cThis fear that is permeating our land needs to cease and can only happen with a meaningful reduction in crime, a concerted effort in prosecuting criminals and a reduction in legal red tape bugging the judicial system. As the Dr Keith Rowley-led administration approaches its first anniversary in office, the chamber along with the nation continues to await the implementation of proposed policies.\\u201d In Debe, several key projects, including the Debe segment of the extension of the Solomon Hochoy Highway to Point Fortin, were still incomplete and contractors not being paid for work done continues to have a crippling ripple effect on the businesses. Unemployment is higher than before and underemployment is very de-motivating to young and aspiring graduates, Roopnarine added.

It is also news that should confirm to the G20 that what used to be the G7\\u2014 a group of the seven industrialised nations\\u2014no longer controls the world's financial affairs. On July 15 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) established the New Development Bank (NDB) and alongside it a Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). The two institutions will serve the needs of the five countries for financing infrastructure and industrialisation, and to provide support in the event of a balance of payments crisis. The NDB will be headquartered in Shanghai, with India as its President for the first term of six years. It will be capitalised initially with US$50 billion. Each BRICS member state will subscribe an equal share. The CRA will be funded with US$100 billion. China is contributing the largest share of about US$41 billion while Russia, Brazil and India will put in US$18 billion each and South Africa US$5 billion. The creation of the NDB and the CRA is motivated by frustration with the pace of reform of the IMF and the World Bank to give a greater voice to the BRICS. In the Fortaleza Declaration after their meeting in Brazil, the five BRICS leaders stated that international governance under its current structure and power configuration show increasing signs of losing legitimacy and effectiveness. They said \\\"the BRICS are an important force for incremental change and reform of current institutions toward more representative and equitable governance capable of generating more inclusive global growth\\\". The BRICS are also concerned that the new vision for global economic governance, articulated by the G20 in 2009, has not materialised. It will also be at least two years before the NDB becomes fully operational, and the parliaments of the five countries are still to ratify the bank and the CRA\\u2014certainly in India, this will be a contentious process. Whether the NDB and the CRA remain open only to the BRICS or they widen their lending to all other developing countries, their establishment signals that it cannot be business as usual for the World Bank and the IMF, and that decision-making in the G20 will have to change rapidly. BRICS represent 42 per cent of the world's population and roughly 20 per cent of the world's economy based on GDP. Total trade between them is US$6.14 trillion, or nearly 17 per cent of the world's total. Importantly, together they are the world's largest market and their combined GDP grew by more than 300 per cent in the last ten years. Those are not figures to be scoffed-at, and the BRICS have now shown that they are serious about demanding change. Other developing countries, including those in 15-nation Caricom, should applaud the BRICS for creating their two new institutions. They have all endured the harsh terms, rigid conditionalities and unyielding dictates of the IMF and the World Bank. They would welcome any move that rattles the Washington-based institutions, which are controlled by the US and Europe, and encourages them to reform and to be more flexible in the treatment of developing countries that are confronted with crises. The NDB could be a much needed source of financing to developing countries for infrastructure, industrialization and productive development that many nations, such as those in the Caribbean Community (Caricom), are now denied. Except for Haiti, Caricom countries (13 of them) have been \\\"graduated'' from access to concessional financing by the World Bank. The CRA could also allow developing economies to draw on pooled reserves in the event of balance of payments crises on terms that are more appropriate and more sympathetic than those now applied by the IMF. Risk management, a high-quality loan portfolio that improves development but keeps default to a minimum, surveillance and profits are all crucial to any bank's successes, and they will be vital to the NDB's survival\\u2014so standards will have to be high. But within those important parameters the BRICS should devise ways in which they could allow other developing countries, particularly small and medium-sized ones, to buy into the NDB and the CRA on terms they can afford. Arrangements should also be made for borrowings by developing countries on less onerous and more sympathetic conditions than the requirements of the IMF and World Bank.

While his maritime exploits are well highlighted in the pages of history, he is less considered for what was probably a more remarkable featconvincing Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain to fund his fanciful start-up venture of trying to find a westward route to the Far East. It perhaps seems an odd analogy, but it is one Central Bank Governor Jwala Rambarran used to great effect to highlight the role of venture capital funding in supporting innovative ideas that despite the great inherent risks, can produce even greater returns for the investor. For a region discovered some 525 years ago thanks to venture capital financing, the Caribbean has failed to develop a vibrant and indigenous venture capital industry, Rambarran said in his address at the Caribbean Centre for Money and Finances seminar on Venture Capital Financing last Friday at the Hyatt Regency (Trinidad), Port of Spain. The regional venture capital landscape is, at best, in an embryonic stage, Rambarran said, and in Caribbean economies, venture capital fundraising (as a per cent of gross domestic product or GDP) is negligible, or at zero. Several venture capital funds have closed since 2008. In Trinidad and Tobago, the venture capital industry has collapsed, and most venture capital investment, even when finally deployed, has financed start-ups of small to medium enterprises without any discernable positive economic impact, he said. The global environment that is likely to be less favourable than in the recent past because of tighter financing conditions as well as slower growth in some advanced economies and major emerging markets. Caribbean policymakers, in their search for new sources of development finance, are rekindling their interest in venture capital to help spur innovation, create jobs and support economic growth, he said. And thats where Columbus comes in. Rabarran said: Think about it. Christopher Columbus created a model for the modern Caribbean entrepreneur to follow. He spent seven years pitching his business plan to Genoese bankers (the worlds first angel networks) before convincing Ferdinand and Isabella (institutional investors at heart, if not in name) to fund his risky start-up venture in 1492. His business plan called for using three ships to discover a faster sea route to India and China by sailing west into the Atlantic. He persuaded Ferdinand and Isabella that a new route to Asia would disrupt Portugals monopoly on Asian exploration and give Spain vast riches such as silk, spices, gold and precious stones. He also convinced the royals that a new sea route would give Spain the glory of a new discovery, expand the Spanish Empire and propagate the spread of Christianity. Columbus, the explorer and adventurer, had no spectacular track record nor demonstrated any remarkable abilities as a mariner but he did invest some of his own resources into the venture. Like all entrepreneurs, Columbus miscalculated the risks of his westward voyage. Many things could have gone wrong that would prevent Columbus from returning to Spain: getting lost, starving, shipwreck and mutiny. At the same time, all Ferdinand and Isabella risked was investment capital but couldand ultimately did benefit from the upside potential. Their risky venture paid off handsomely, and the mineral wealth extracted from the New World laid the foundation for Spains domination of Europe for the next century. The world is not so different today than 525 years ago, Rambarran continued. Financing entrepreneurial ventures has changed little over the centuries. Today, we know that venture capital involves long term investments in risky, young companies, often with unproven management teams addressing new technologies in uncertain markets. Yet the innovation that occurs in these small companies is an important force in moving a country into the knowledge economy, he said. In this regard, Caribbean governments have an important but carefully balanced role to play in creating a healthy ecosystem in which venture capital can truly thrive. He suggested three key lessons upon which Caribbean policymakers could base their economic transformation agenda. Borrowing from Babson College Professor of Management Practice Daniel Isenbergs June 2010 article in the Harvard Business Review, Rambarran said the first thing is to stop attempting to replicate Silicon Valley in California, USAthe internationally renowned hotbed of technology innovation. Silicon Valley could not even replicate itself today if it tried. Its ecosystem evolved from the convergence of a unique set of circumstances: a large pool of skilled engineers and scientists from major universities in the area; the laid-back but driven for speed California culture; generous funding from a strong aerospace market with the Defence Department; development of an efficient network of venture capital firms; the institutional leadership of Stanford University; and pure luck, among other things, he said. He noted the governments failed attempt to create its own Silicon Valley in 2008, investing an estimated US$150 million in the Caribbeans first Science and Technology Park the Tamana InTech Park. The principal purpose of the Tamana InTech Park was to drive economic diversification in Trinidad and Tobago through the establishment of technology intensive, knowledge-driven industries in the non-energy sectors. The Park would be home to major technology players and the place where ground-breaking and innovative ideas would emerge. One of the Parks largest tenants, The University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT), would provide the necessary synergy between industry and academia in bringing emerging technologies to market. Unfortunately, despite several expressions of interest, Tamana InTech Park has yet to sign one tenant, he said. This brings me to my second lesson. Trinidad and Tobagos experience with Tamana InTech Park shows that governments cannot build ecosystems alone. Governments should engage the private sector, ideally from the start, and let it keep or acquire a significant stake in the ecosystems success. The government can directly approach technology investment firms and technology researchers to determine what they need to develop a world-class industry. If the private investor then offers to match say half of the funds, ambitions would be tempered and targeted to meet the specific needs of the market. Furthermore, requiring matching funds not only ensures the private sector is willing to risk its own money but also tests the potential of the technology or investment firm, he said. Thirdly, Rambarran suggested that small, open Caribbean economies need to favour scale-up rather than start-up ventures. Since small size is the major constraint to economic growth in the Caribbean, there is a compelling argument for policymakers to stop treating the quantity of start-ups as an indicator of success and to start looking at the quality of those start-ups that grow and eventually scale-up. One high-potential venture which grows to 100 people in five years will create the same number of jobs as 50 bottom-of-the-pyramid ventures which stagnate at two people, he said. Contrary to popular opinion, high-potential is not always synonymous with high-tech, Rambarran said, and it is not the surest path to competitiveness and prosperity. In fact, Caribbean economies may get more development bang for the buck by supporting low tech sectors like food processing and forestry than by trying to develop a few high-tech niche products and industries. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, the agricultural sector offers many high-potential, low-tech, foreign exchange generating business opportunities such as cocoa, pineapple, tilapia and coconut, waiting to be fully exploited by private investors, he said. Five centuries later, it is time for the Caribbean to continue the venture capital voyage started by the master entrepreneur, Columbus, he said.

Watson said that energising the economy and luring more investment is not going to be as simple as a few payouts as global financial conditions and the economies of Caribbean neighbours dependent on tourist dollars would still be factors out of the control of the Trinidad and Tobago Government. Last Monday, Central Bank Governor, Ewart Williams, joined those calling for greater efforts by the Government to revive investor and consumer confidence in the local economy. \\\"I don't think confidence is something restricted to local conditions or to paying off these debts. It is related to all kinds of things,\\\" Watson said in a telephone interview. \\\"It sort of poses the question of what came first, the chicken or the egg. The business community as a whole is responding to things both local and international.\\\" Watson pointed out that the majority of goods manufactured locally are exported, particularly within the Caribbean. Most Caribbean countries who consume these goods also rely heavily on tourism, which is currently mild at best, coming out of the United States and Europe, he said. (See Pages 8&9) And even restoring confidence in the local economy, he said, will not boost local manufacturing if there is no one to consume the goods. \\\"If the region is not prepared to receive the goods, then local manufacturers will not be able to produce more,\\\" Watson said. He said the Government was in no way trying to avoid the issues facing the local economy nor was he denying the part played by factors such as debt resolution, in restoring a robust economy. \\\"I'm saying that people are not going to rush because of some magic wand,\\\" he insisted. \\\"I'm not saying that some local conditions to do not contribute to a lack of confidence and I am not running away from the challenge of trying to restore confidence but confidence will not be reinstated precisely from these issues. The thing is quite complicated.\\\" Watson said he felt that a series of incentives would be a better start towards getting the economy moving than simply paying off CLICO policyholders, which he called \\\"an intractable matter\\\" and \\\"one of the worse that anyone could contend with\\\". The construction of the proposed highway through Point Fortin, he said, would also be a strong stimulus that he felt would prod a certain amount of local spending. \\\"But that is not going to help the economy of Antigua,\\\" he said. \\\"Their mainstay is tourism and until that sector recovers, they are not going to buy our manufactured goods.\\\" Watson said the Government was committed to resolving its debts. \\\"If it is one thing that is happening in the Ministry of Finance, the ministry is taking the bull by the horns and dealing with it,\\\" he said. Referring to the CLICO issue, Watson said: \\\"You have a group of people who were promised by a government that they would get back every cent and continue to enjoy the interest rates they previously enjoyed. These are matters not easily dealt with and no matter what you do, someone will always be upset.\\\" Some of the resolutions would run late and this too will not serve to restore confidence in the economy, he said. \\\"Are you saying that if we solve the CLICO problem tomorrow that businesses will start to produce It's not that simple,\\\" Watson stressed. \\\"True, it is part of the formula but I cannot imagine that anything could be so facile as that.\\\" Watson also suggested that the CLICO matter may never be fully resolved, adding: \\\"The only way to stem the anger of the CLICO people is to give all of them back every cent and that would put this economy into a tailspin you cannot imagine. We are paying off a certain amount now and from then on, every year we are committed to finding half a billion dollars. \\\"Even that is risky. God knows what could happen next year and whether we will be able to find that half a billion dollars.\\\" Finance Minister Winston Dookeran had, in November of this year, said the Government was moving towards a Christmas payout to policyholders of a lump sum of $75,000, the amount announced in the September budget. That payout did not come to fruition and Dookeran said last Saturday he was looking instead to a payout next month. Commenting on the delay, Watson said \\\"every gear\\\" in the Ministry of Finance has been engaged in resolving the CLICO matter and the delay is not an indication that the State will back away from its promise. \\\"Every claim has to be processed, verified, a system has to be worked. There will be delays,\\\" he said.

After long struggling to claw its way out of the Great Recession, the worlds biggest economy is on an extended win streak that is edging it closer to full health. But the new year doesnt look quite so bright in other major countries. China is slowing as it transitions from investment to consumption. Japan has slid into a recession. Russia appears headed for one. Europe is barely growing. And the US Six years after its financial system nearly sank and nearly that long since the recession ended, the United States is expected to grow in 2015 at its fastest pace in a decade. Its expansion from July through September a five per cent annual rate was the swiftest for any quarter since 2003. That pace will likely ease a bit. Still, the economy is expected to expand 3.1 per cent this year, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics. It would be the first year of three per cent growth since 2005. The acceleration of US growth is a key reason the global economy is also expected to grow faster, at about three per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in 2014, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase and IHS Global Insight. CHEERING CHEAPER OIL Plunging oil prices are a big reason for the optimism. Prices have been cut roughly in half since last summer. In some areas of the country, gasoline prices have slipped below US$2 a gallon. The drop, along with more fuel-efficient cars, will save the average US household US$550 on gas this year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That means consumers have more to spend on items like cars, furniture and appliances. Whats more, Americans finances are in firmer shape. Job growth is accelerating. Businesses are investing in buildings and software, and home building is expected to pick up. Lower oil prices will also help Europe and Japan, and the global economy should expand faster than it did last year, economists say. But the divergence between the United States and most of the rest of the world is striking and carries some risks. Big exporters, from China to Germany to Japan, will depend heavily on a recovering US to boost their economies. A pick-up in global growth is highly dependent on the assumption that the US economy continues to improve, said Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. If that doesnt play out, theres not much left for the global economy to fall back on. SWIRLING GLOBAL HEADWINDS Even if the US economy does strengthen further, the rest of the world could struggle. For one thing, faster growth will likely lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2015, which could draw more investment from overseas. The inflow of capital would raise the dollars value and potentially cause destabilising drops in other currencies. Governments and businesses overseas that borrowed in dollars would find it harder to repay those debts. The hot economies of the last decade the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China collectively known as the BRICs will likely grow in 2015 at their slowest pace in six years, according to Oxford Economics, a forecasting firm. Falling oil and commodity prices have smacked Brazil and Russia particularly hard. China may expand 6.5 per cent or more. Yet thats a far cry from the nearly double-digit growth it enjoyed for decades. Europe and Japan will be lucky to expand even one per cent. The gap between the US and the rest of the world reflects a fundamental trait of the US economy: Its more insulated from the rest of the worlds ups and downs than other major economies are. Exports account for just 14 per cent of US output, the smallest share among the 34 mostly rich members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. One US company largely protected from overseas trends is Globe Specialty Metals, a Miami-based producer of silicon metals that draws 90 per cent of its revenue from North America. Its silicon is added to aluminium and rubber parts used in cars, and robust auto sales have boosted the companys revenue. CEO Jeff Bradley says hes optimistic about 2015. As gas prices have sunk, Americans have been buying more SUVs and pick-ups, which use more aluminium. Demand for solar power panels is also lifting sales. Things are lining up for next year to be one of the best years in the history of our company, Bradley said. POWERING CONSUMERS In the United States, consumers are the main drivers of growth. And fortunes are looking up for more households. Employers were on track to add the most jobs in 15 years in 2014. As a percentage of income, Americans debt has dropped to 2002 levels. In some ways, the US economy actually benefits from slower growth abroad. Investors in search of safety have plowed money into Treasurys, thereby helping hold down inflation and US loan rates, including for mortgages. Lower rates, in turn, could fuel more home sales and construction next year. Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, thinks Americans ages 25 to 34, stung by higher rents, will buy homes in greater numbers by the end of 2015. Mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have relaxed their down payment requirements, which were a strain for younger would-be buyers. Humphries also thinks developers will build more lower-priced homes that millennials can afford. Some signs of hope overseas have emerged. Falling oil prices should benefit people in Europe, Japan and China, all of which import oil. And analysts expect the European Central Bank to ramp up its stimulus efforts, possibly by buying government bonds. That step would inject more cash into the economy to boost lending and keep rates low.

Various indications have since combined to reassure citizens that the sky is not falling on the economy.Business Express Energy Insider specialist David Renwick has been reporting that large, historic investment in oil and gas exploration by BHP Billiton has been optimistically proceeding inside T&T's deep-water horizon. Last month, too, Doddridge Miller, CEO of the Sagicor Group, affirmed the economy, declaring: \\\"There have been no issues we've seen so far that would cause us to be concerned.\\\" Sagicor, emphasising ease of doing business, has short-listed T&T, alongside the UK and Bermuda, for possible relocation of its headquarters. Outspoken Independent Senator, business executive and academic Rolph Balgobin answered \\\"most certainly not\\\" to the rhetorical question of whether the economy is in trouble. Dr Balgobin and other business and economic observers have called attention to labour productivity and the fuel subsidy as specifics crying out for correction.Meanwhile, former finance minister Wendell Mottley found no cause to be unduly troubled by Moody's findings, and called on the Government for a \\\"proactive.and forward thinking\\\" response. But perhaps the biggest endorsement of T&T's promise has come from the biggest energy investor, bpTT. Proudly announcing the arrival of advanced new equipment for its own deep-water exploration, bpTT regional president Norman Christie helped settle remaining doubts as he reasserted his company's \\\"continued commitment to Trinidad and Tobago\\\".This is not to say, though, that the international rating agency's pronouncement should be flippantly ignored and we all proceed apace without any effort to counteract the revised rating.For business owners are nothing if not optimists, their main purpose being to encourage spending. And politicians are no less so, the sole aim of the majority of them being to convince citizens that they are doing a brilliant job with the economy. Their one-track mentality applies even more leading up to an evenly contested general election, with the party in power going out of its way to promise the moon and the stars to the populace.So it is indeed reassuring that those driving the country's vital energy sector continue to look on the bright side, but we would do well to admit that all is not well and corrective action needs to be taken sooner rather than later.Productivity and subsidies have long been highlighted as negative factors and that is a good place to start. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling.

International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him.

The survey findings, representing the views of about 2,200 professional accountants around the world, were welcomed by the two professional bodies: the share of respondents reporting confidence gains in their own organisations had nearly doubled from 16 per cent in late 2011 to 29 per cent and while the majority (54 per cent) still believed the global economy was deteriorating or stagnating, that figure was down from 73 per cent in the previous quarter. Brenda Lee-Tang, head of ACCA Caribbean said in a statement of the latest findings: \\\"Business confidence in the Caribbean does not appear to have risen in early 2012, with the region underperforming the rest of the Americas. But the biggest winner in relative terms has been Jamaica, where confidence grew more than anywhere else in the region. The Bahamas, on the other hand, has underperformed compared to the rest of the region amidst pre-election uncertainty, ending 2011 with lower confidence levels and additionally gaining less confidence than other Caribbean countries in the first months of 2012. Although the employment outlook and general business conditions across the region appear to have improved, businesses are still under a lot of pressure and respondents have cited fewer new value-added business opportunities.\\\" Emmanouil Schizas, editor of the ACCA/IMA Global Economic Conditions Survey, said of the global findings: \\\"When all the results came in, we were a little sceptical and had to consider all of the likely objections first. Much of the rise in confidence is being reversed as we speak, as the relief factor subsides, but a lot of it is here to stay.\\\" ACCA and IMA attribute much of the rise in global business confidence to objective improvements to the business environment, especially new orders, but also warn that relief is an important driver in the short term - especially due to the fact that a number of nightmare scenarios that had seemed likely in late 2011, such as an escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis or a hard landing in China, appeared more remote in the last quarter. There also appears to be a renewed faith in the prospects of the global economy and the strength of the recovery. These developments were also reflected in rising business investment and employment. Confidence gains were fairly consistent across regions and industries, although the Americas and Western Europe seemed to benefit the most in early 2012, as did manufacturers and distributors, particularly in the high-tech sectors. The survey reported increasing business dynamism, mostly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, with businesses securing new orders where previously they would not have and responding with increased investment and hiring. ACCA and IMA welcomed this development, noting that investment has been subdued at the global level since the end of the 'green shoots' stage of the global recovery which lasted from mid-2009 to mid-2010. Africa is still the most confident of the seven major regions covered by the survey, but it is clearly losing ground. \\\"ACCA and IMA believe that the bounce in investment is focusing on two kinds of opportunities in particular. Customer insights, namely the need to understand and benefit from spending decisions under new constraints, is one; the other is supply chain optimisation through deepening relationships and a stronger focus on quality.\\\" The professional bodies also acknowledge the contribution of governments in their major markets, many of which showed signs of loosening their fiscal policies to boost a flagging recovery. It is not clear how much longer they can afford to do so, as respondents generally continue to believe that many major economies, including both the US and China, are likely to spend unsustainably in the medium term. On the other hand, finance professionals in Western Europe and other countries experiencing austerity also doubted the sustainability of their own governments' fiscal policies. Emmanouil Schizas said: \\\"It's too early to say whether the pattern of the modest recovery in 2012 is sustainable, but it seems to rely on a sustained recovery of demand in the West, supply in the East and confidence in sovereigns. It's a precarious balance.\\\" Finally, ACCA and IMA noted that the global economy's new-found dynamism has come at the price of rising input prices, and note that if even a timid recovery is accompanied by rising inflation, then a full-blown recovery, if and when it occurs, is likely to provide a challenge for central banks and other policymakers.

So much so that he wondered why governments have been so hesitant to recognise that the energy sector will not be able to sustain our economy for much longer. Further, the governor warns, with the sustained low prices of natural gasthough the price of oil is relatively high, our production is droppingat this stage, the energy sector can only support the economy at a reduced level. The Minister of Planning, in his presentation at the Fourth Biennial Conference on Business, Banking and Finance, also recognised that we need to diversify the economy as he compared our overall performance in the 2010-2011 Global Competitive Index, in which we stood at number 84, as compared with Barbados at 46, Costa Rica at 56 and Chile at 30. What this overall position for T&T hid is that in the category of innovation, we were second to last out of 139 countries. This is a critical condemnation of our economy since in today's world, innovation is the key to competitiveness in the export and local markets. He blamed our poor showing, for example, on the mismatch between our education system and the labour market, the reluctance of people coming out of our tertiary education system to start businesses, instead of looking for a job. Hence, according to the minister, we need to transform the economy and get into services and knowledgethings that use human talentand move into things that employ natural assets, beyond oil and gas. He also saw Government's role as improving the business environment, making it business-friendly not standing in the way of people who want to do business. And this role has to include building a quality education and training system that fits with the economy because it produces the talent pool that the private and public sectors draw from. Yet T&T is the largest exporter of its trained personnel in the region, and even the Planning Minister admits, at the moment, 25 per cent of our university graduates are under-employed, implying the present private and public sectors have no need for such skills skills that were readily employable abroad. The minister concludes that efficiency is what makes companies competitive, and they are productive when you have a good match between skills of the people, their technical level and the companies that are producing at a level of effectiveness since these are the minimum standards required worldwide. Gregory McGuire, in the July 2011 T&T Review, also recognised the need to diversify the economy and questioned the Planning Minister on how he intends to proceed continue to implement the non-policy Vision 2020, or follow the lead of his predecessor or even create his own policy direction The economic model as it exists in T&T cannot conceive the required diversification, and this is evident since governments, academia, business, etc, have been talking about economic diversification for at least the past thirty years. The current economy has certain systemic failures, characteristics that prevent its evolution into a globally competitive export economy, outside of the energy sector, which itself is a contributory factor to the onshore systemic failures. Hence, many of the minister's comments are pure rhetoric. The required economic development today demands certain key activities. These include: the provision of knowledge inputs to an innovative production process, via the encouragement of R&D (research and development); the building of a related human resource in innovation and R&D activities; and the identification of new product markets. The critical requirement is the provision of an innovation system that creates and modifies organisations needed to develop new fields of R&D and innovation; the building of networks through marketing and interactive learning among the different innovative organisations; provision of R&D investment; and removing obstacles to innovation. A cursory examination of our economy will demonstrate that even the embryo of such a system does not exist in our economyon or offshore.

The study was based on a survey of more than 1,750 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Canada, China, Italy, Singapore, South Africa, and the UK, with 30 per cent of the sample micro businesses employing fewer than ten people. It shows that while most SMEs believed the worst of the recession had past, there was an unexpectedly high number of businesses - between 31 per cent and 54 per cent in each country, including those which have seen high growth and were less affected by the global downturn, who felt they did not have adequate cash reserves to survive another financial crisis. SMEs surveyed said the recession has forced them to become better businesses and if they take on risk it is only where they can have control. Growing businesses, especially in the more dynamic economies, appear to be facing stiffer competition and rising costs, putting profit margins under pressure. According to respondents, lenders appear to be directing funds to larger SMEs and big corporations rather than micro and small enterprises. The study also found that credit is being directed away from working capital towards capacity building investments and is increasingly likely to be secured against personal or business assets, while equity investments are drawn to acquisitions and to financing local or international expansion. As commercial providers of finance have become reluctant to finance working capital, assume customer credit risks or refinance debt, the weight of expectation has shifted to shareholders and trade creditors. The study found that those businesses that value professional or expert advisers above others have performed better - professional advice has given lean SMEs more confidence about their chances of survival, by ensuring that they have fewer urgent financing needs and better access to credit. The study has made a number of recommendations. SMEs must consider factors such as interest rate increases, exchange rate volatility and inflation when developing business plans and risk management policies. Governments can help reduce uncertainty through early and reliable commitments on tax, spending, monetary policy and regulation. Governments must consider strengthening loan guarantee schemes for SMEs to provide solutions where sufficient collateral cannot be provided. More businesses should explore supply chain finance: whereby large customers provide credit to small suppliers by factoring their own invoices, and governments, commonly the most creditworthy customers of SMEs, should consider similar means of financing their suppliers. Business advisers and government-funded enterprise support agencies must prioritise improving credit- and investment-readiness among SMEs by explaining the information needs of capital providers and championing other sources of finance, such as business angels, where appropriate. Providers of capital must be clear about their lending or investment criteria and consider the need for security or personal guarantees flexibly, case-by-case. Businesses should use financial and credit information on their customers and ensure their information is available to prospective trading partners. Governments must acknowledge the critical importance of trade credit as a financial market, ensuring that credit information is widely available and that creditors have access to reasonable means of enforcing their claims. Business advisers and government-funded enterprise development agencies should be looking for undercapitalised SMEs and actively encouraging action if necessary. Providers of capital should acknowledge the value of professional advice in their communications with SMEs and consider directing unsuccessful applicants to professional advisers. Helen Brand, chief executive of ACCA, says: \\\"It has been a challenging two years for small businesses around the world but they have emerged, on the whole, somewhat wiser, more in control and cautiously optimistic. However the recovery, such as it is, presents its own unique risks. As this research demonstrates, having the tools, the support and the confidence to navigate these risks can make all the difference between continued growth and stagnation for small businesses.\\\" \\\"Although there are signs of economic recovery, the SME sector is not out of the woods yet,\\\" says Anthony Ariganello, president and CEO of CGA-Canada. \\\"We believe it's vitally important to understand the issues faced by this sector - and having taken an in-depth look at the current situation - it's clear there are things to be done by policy-makers, by business advisers, by financial institutions and by the businesses themselves.\\\" Giancarlo Attolini, board member in charge of International Affairs at CNDCEC, says: \\\"Professionals can play a crucial role in the current financial crisis, supporting SMEs in their decisions concerning financing decisions and business planning. Good budgeting of financial resources and ability to secure third-party capital proves to be key in surviving the crisis. The survey shows that financing needs to change, based on enterprises' needs and geographical location. Micro and small enterprises, which represent the main clients of most practitioners, went through great difficulties in securing finance during the credit crunch; professional skills and advice can adequately support them in accessing finance and managing their cash flows.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

I think the simplest and most effective way of helping to stimulate the economy would be to encourage spending. Spending stimulates business activity, it encourages businessmen to invest more of their profits back into their businesses through expansion of facilities and manpower, thus lowering unemployment and increasing business activity, which in the long-run would lead to increased tax collections. The best and most effective way to achieve this is to simply increase the personal allowance from $60,000 per year to, I suggest, $180,000. This radical adjustment automatically precludes persons earning less than $15,000 per month from paying taxes. Why is this important Well, the majority of persons earning $15,000 or less would fall into the middle class. This automatically increases their spending power, and the amount of money available for savings, say, for a new home or purchase of land. Also, the cost of living has gone up tremendously since this allowance was raised several years ago. It also means the majority of public servants would be paying no taxes. This is something that unions should be lobbying the government for also, as it benefits their membership directly. Secondly, an incremental increase in the price of both premium gas and diesel, in the order of, say, 50 cents. It is a 33 per cent increase in the price of diesel, but we have to bite the bullet now if we are really serious about lowering the subsidy on fuels. If the subsidy was really $4 billion, then this increase would cut $1.3 billion immediately. Finally, the issue of VAT returns to businesses. This process needs to be sped up, as some businesses are on the verge of closure, especially those that are buying VAT inputs to sell zero-rated products. The cash flow is severely hampered, and solving this issue seems to be a problem, no matter which government is in power. Remember, happy investors will always look to re-invest or increase their investments.

It may be a slight modification of the thrill-of-the-chase syndrome. Entrepreneur Joe Pires explains it better. \\\"I love the excitement of openings. I hate running the business,\\\" Pires tells the Business Express. And so the adrenalin rush of turning an idea into a money-making venture has led to his ownership or co-ownership of more than 30 businesses over the years. His interests have varied from a new mega farm project which he controls as the managing director of the family-owned Caribbean Chemicals and Agencies Ltd to nightclub 51 Degrees to cellular outlet Red Cell. Throughout his eclectic mix of businesses there remains a consistent thread. Pires is always looking for the solution to a specific need and continues to create businesses that cater to a niche market. He says this is his secret. \\\"I always look for niches, you know, like 51 Degrees. I just look for different areas to make a little niche,\\\" he said. \\\"Every year I open up a different company, just about... So every year I look for something new and unique. Some failed, some have worked and that is where you tuck your tail between your legs, learn your lessons and move on.\\\" He first got the idea for his latest project after observing his own consumer behaviour. Last Thursday Pires formally opened a wine and cheese shop in Maraval called Bottlestop. He hopes it will cater to the needs of those interested in the convenience of shopping for all their party supplies in one place. \\\"So this came up because when I'm looking to get things for a party, I have to run to one location to get some ice, go to another location to get coconut water, to another location to get Coke... and I just felt that there should be one place where I could go to get everything,\\\" he said in an interview. \\\"It's like a one-stop shop, but I don't like to use one-stop shop because we are not like a seven -eleven. This is focused on another thing. This is focused on convenience, this is focused on bringing the price of alcohol down, so you will find that our prices are very competitive and the more you buy the better the price that you will get.\\\" From coconut water to wine, the shelves at the #43 Boissierre Village, Maraval store are stocked with a range of items that you will need to host the perfect lime. The store is located on the top floor of the building while the ground floor is available for hosting parties. He also hopes that the store will be a place where people can learn about the wide variety of wines that are on the market so that they can make informed decisions. \\\"We are going to be spending a lot of time on educating people. We will have miniature screens that will tell you about the wines that are on a shelf. \\\"We will also have new education tools that we are custom designing, which means when you come in and pick up a bottle, it actually tells you what this wine is about, where it is from, what year it is, what is the make up of it, whether it is oaky, whether it is fruity pairings as well.\\\" Given the stagnant economy, Pires admits that his recent undertaking is ambitious, but he thinks that his decision to delve into the alcohol market is the right choice. \\\"Rum will always sell. You know when things are bad people turn to alcohol, rum and water will always sell no matter what the economy. Whether it is good or bad I think there is never a wrong time to open a business if there is a niche,\\\" he said. \\\"I have done this over the last 20 years. Looking for niches and opening new businesses and looking to see new opportunities.\\\" Now nearly 50, Pires knows through experience that critically important to his success, is his ability to attract reliable management for his companies. \\\"I pick good people to run the businesses and I put a lot of trust in them. I am a hands-on manager during the run up to the opening ... I am a stickler for detail, I am a perfectionist. We should have opened up about three to four weeks ago but I was not ready to open up. I'm a firm believer that a good start is a good finish. So I waited, paid my landlord a lot more rent extra rather than rush to open up.\\\" Pires has been through the process of conceptualising to establishing a business on numerous occasions and understands the trials that most entrepreneurs face. \\\"The hardest thing in Trinidad is to find financing especially for young entrepreneurs so I know exactly what it is to be 22 or 24 and have a lot of bright ideas, I was like that. My father used to keep turning me down and turning me down. That's what fathers do. \\\"My advice would be to live your dream, never think that your dream will never come to pass, focus on it, stay committed to it and continue to dream. I still have dreams even at this stage in my career.\\\" He said: \\\"Fortunately for me it is getting easier because of my relationships with banks, with the knowledge that I have gained over the years. \\\"It is still challenging but I love it, I love the excitement of opening something new, I love to see it succeed.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

The IMF team which came to Port of Spain was headed by Judith Gould. It observed that there was \\\"concrete evidence that the economy is turning the corner and that economic growth will resume in 2012 notwithstanding the ongoing technical disruptions in the energy sector.\\\" While economist Dr Dhanyshar Mahabir has criticised the IMF's statement as being \\\"dead wrong\\\" when it comes to the local economy , Finance Minister Winston Dookeran believes the latest IMF report represents major positive news for T&T's economy. The full-length report, which received the blessings of the T&T Government before it was posted on the IMF's website focused on specific issues the country's Heritage and Stablisation Fund and Developments and Prospects in the Energy Sector. The IMF is of the view that T&T should amend the HSF Act to provide a greater weight to the savings objective in line with current practices while preserving its stablisation objective to provide some scope to manage the impact of high volatility of energy price on public finance. It observed that: \\\"Although the HSF has dual heritage and stablisation objectives, in practice it has served more as a heritage fund. The lack of withdrawals when energy revenues have fallen sharply together with conservative budget assumptions for energy prices suggest a strong preference to safeguard and to increase savings rather than to rely on the HSF for fiscal stablisation.\\\" By the same token the IMF believes the 25 per cent ceiling on the maximum withdrawal during a given year could be reduced. \\\"If greater emphasis were given to the savings objective, this limit could be revised downward to ten per cent to the HSF balance in any one year with a cumulative withdrawal of at most 25 per cent, which would also be consistent with the proposed capital floor. This would imply a narrowing of the space for withdrawals if there are several years of weak energy prices. At the same time, a persistent need for withdrawals could indicate a need to revise the assumed energy price projections.\\\" The IMF has put the onus on the Government to have greater clarity over the HSF's objectives with updating the withdrawal rules in determining investment strategy. The IMF believes this could provide a basis for pursuing a longer-term investment strategy. Also, there's scope to adjust the procedures for calculating and making deposits into the HSF to increase transparency and reduce the administrative burden. It recommeded that the government \\\"make deposits into the HSF semi-annually rather than quarterly, on a year-to-date basus, and with a lag after the end of the period so that deposits can be made based on finalised data.\\\" Observing that the energy sector accounts for 44 per cent of nominal GDP, the Fund noted that the energy sector is poised to recover but it is also facing significant risks. \\\"Nothwithstanding a number of setbacks in recent years, natural gas output is expected to rebound in 2012 as upgrade and maintenance work in the upstream sector is completed. The petrochemical sector is also forecast to resume operating at more normal levels with a recovery in the availability of gas,\\\" it observed. The IMF concluded that: \\\"Over the longer term, increased exploration in Trinidad and Tobago could reverse the downward trend in oil and gas reserves. However, uncertainties in the global gas market, on account of the potential of rapid growth of shale gas production worldwide, pose a challenge for the development of longer-term investment plans.\\\" A statement issued to the media last Friday on behalf of the Ministry of Finance noted that commercial bank credit particularly to the business sector, has expanded steadily since mid-2011, for the first time since early 2010, and that retail sales increased by 6.4 per cent up to the third quarter of 2011. The statement observed that Trinidad and Tobago's recovery comes after an extended slowdown lasting three years, in which \\\"ample buffers have provided room for manoeuvre,\\\" accommodating an expansionary fiscal stance in 2010/2011, and resources to deal with the collapse of \\\"a systemic insurance company.\\\" Among its major highlights, the report listed the following: 1. There was \\\"weaker than anticipated energy sector activity\\\" which contributed to a decline in 2011 2. The central government's finances were \\\"nearly balanced\\\" in fiscal 2010/2011 3. Monetary policy remained \\\"accommodative in the face of subdued inflation\\\" 4. Strain had emerged in the financial system \\\"as a consequence of the prolonged slowdown and the collapse of the CL Financial Group and its insurance subsidiary CLICO\\\" but progress was made in compensating CLICO claimants although on-going legal issues could lead to further delays. 5. Regarding the rebounding of the country's external accounts, the report said current account surplus increased to 20 percent of GDP in 2010, and was estimated to be 21 per cent in 2011, up from eight per cent in 2009. This would have stemmed mainly from the improvement in energy prices and a recovery in non-energy exports. 6. Gross official reserves grew to US$9.8 billion. This represents 13 months of import cover, at the end of 2011, increasing from US$9.1 billion at the end of 2010. 7. Surveying the outlook in the short term, the report said real economic activity is expected to increase by 1.7 per cent in 2012, \\\"as the energy sector resumes normal operations later in the year, and the non-energy sector picks up momentum with the acceleration of public investment and the restructuring of CLICO liabilities. 8. Inflation is expected to remain moderate. 9. Mediumterm growth is expected to rise to 2.5 per cent. This was described as having been \\\"significantly less than in the years preceding the crisis, in part due to the weak outlook for the energy sector.\\\" 10. Further to this, the report said the non-energy growth is expected to reach its potential of 3.5 per cent in 2012. Dookeran said: \\\"The report confirms that confidence has returned significantly to the Trinidad and Tobago economy.\\\" He believes that this confidence will now have positive impact on the cost of doing business, which will help to further spur growth and development in many sectors. However, Dookeran said that \\\"both domestic and international developments could put at risk, our competitiveness and our inflation expectations. The IMF report said if the 2012 budget is implemented as envisaged, this will provide appropriate stimulus to support the country's recovery.

Anthony described the economic development of the Caribbean as \\u201canaemic\\u201d, pointing to average growth of just 1.1 per cent from 2008 to 2013.

T&T has recently been downgraded in its currency sovereign rating by Standard and Poor\\u2019s (S&P) from BBB+ to BBB. The reasons given for this are; lower than expected energy production and economic growth which will weaken Government\\u2019s revenue base and delay its plans to balance its budget by fiscal year 2020-2021. Further, S&P said that institutional reforms to strengthen revenue collection and improve the provision of timely economic data have taken longer than expected, hence material benefits from these reforms are not expected in the near term. S&P estimated that T&T\\u2019s real GDP grew by 0.8 per cent in 2018 and the rate of economic expansion will decrease to 0.4 per cent in 2019. To S&P, the energy sector contributed to lower and sometimes negative growth over the last several years and this is expected to continue\\u2014particularly now in the gas sector where there is a lot of uncertainty, and oil production continues to be low, continuing a decline seen over a long time. And, as usual for these agencies, the exchange rate certainly limits the monetary policy flexibility and this comes at a cost for defending the rate. S&P expects that this rating of T&T will continue over the next two years. The one positive was that the economic outlook was raised from negative to stable. S&P\\u2019s downgrade did not meet with the approval of the Government in that it disagreed with S&P\\u2019s assessment of a projected decrease in natural gas production given its recent intervention via meetings with the major energy players\\u2014these meetings were supposed to make sure that the reduction in gas production does not come about. Though S&P also predicted a loss in oil production, Heritage was now drilling 16-18 wells. Still, the Prime Minister admitted that Government\\u2019s assignment to run the country on TT$10 billion less is unpleasant, a shortfall that is due explicitly to the reduction in the performance of the energy sector. Indeed, the Government\\u2019s ability to spend, its budget, depends on the vagaries of the local and international energy industry over which the Government has no control. Hence Government\\u2019s decisive role in the economy is reactive, modified only by its ability to save, spend counter cyclically and in the longer term transform the economy. One of our economists tells us that this downgrade was not unexpected, a view that was also expressed by the CEO of the T&T Chamber of Industry and Commerce. This is because the continuing decline in the energy sector- oil and gas production- is common knowledge. To date this one-horse economy depends on the energy sector for its very survival; the horse is now lame! As a small open economy we depend on exports, the earning of foreign exchange, to purchase at least the necessities of life that we cannot produce for ourselves. With the energy sector (oil, gas and petrochemicals) producing some 85 per cent to 90 per cent of our foreign exchange earnings and as price takers economic downside risks are extremely high. Thus, the crucial requirement to diversify the economy was/is always there. Some attempts have been made in the past by government- building industrial parks to attract on-shore foreign investment; negative listing to encourage the private sector to undertake import substitution with the longer term aim of producing export goods; building Pt Lisas to offer the private sector local commodities to go downstream. None of these produced any positive results since the economic horse, energy, was always there to shoulder the load, which has shaped the local investment rules of the economic game on shore that favour the non-tradable sector. Successive governments have failed to appreciate the dynamics of economic diversification especially when one has to start from an economy based on the sole exploitation of a natural resource as virtually its only foreign income earner in a small open economy. Hence, the recent talk about turnaround in the local economy is simply random fluctuations from being a rentier economy in the global energy industry. Still, the projects on the plate of this Government now include; the building of a dry-dock; the building of another industrial park and the invitation to the Chinese to locate some companies there; the establishment of an aluminium processing plant to produce wire, flat plate and motor car wheels; and vague talk about constructing highways to open up the interior for economic activity. But one which was fundamentally strategic was the plan to build out Tobago\\u2019s tourist system into a global value chain by engaging Sandals to do the global market development, marketing and operating of government-owned hotel plant. Unfortunately this project fell apart because the population at large, goaded on by a few, did not understand the need for such a global value chain and how this could come about in Tobago. There are two characteristics of the T&T economy which inhibit diversification. These are; the investment rules of the economic game on shore which favour business in the non-tradable sector and such businessmen; the lack of appreciation that to be globally competitive the activity should not simply be mimicking what others are doing, but eventually doing something new, creating a differentiated product or service, done by entrepreneurs who are, as Schumpeter termed them, men of action, something which all of our governments\\u2019 attempts at diversification ignored. Even if we can create this new group of entrepreneurs we need to put in place the institutions that will provide the knowledge, the ideas, the innovation, the finance, the market development and the marketing. If we were to take another look at what is at present on the government\\u2019s plate and the activity of the private sector on-shore it is painfully evident that diversification may be beyond our reach! IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

One of the things we are working on in Trinidad and Tobago is how easy or difficult it is to use moveable assets-you inventory, your machinery, equipmentto get a loan at the bank. Most of the credit in this country is based on immovable property your house as collateral, but more than 70 per cent of the property are goods and other moveable assets, so can we move towards a framework to allows small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to use these moveable assets to get credit World Bank representative Marialisa Motta said last week. Motta, the Banks director of Finance and Private Sector for Latin America and the Caribbean Region told reporters at a media conference hosted by the Ministry of Trade and Industry at Nicholas Tower, Port of Spain that Trinidad and Tobago already has a good legal framework in place to get this done, but requires a moveable registry that works very well and is efficient to speed up and make more effective the registration of the assets for use as collateral. She cited China as a successful example, where the Bank worked with the government to change collateral lending laws, and after five years, saw a US$1.5 trillion increase in lending. All of this lending has happened using moveable property deeds, accounts receivables and a significant amount of it is going to SMEs and we are seeing a similar striking impact in Africa and Mexico and other Latin American countries; we want to help Trinidad and Tobago as well, she said. Motta was part of a delegation from the World Bank who arrived in Trinidad and Tobago last Monday for a two-day visit, to, among other things, discuss the Banks engagement with the government in particular areas of reform that can have a transformational impact on the economy, competitiveness and job creation.

He explained that this meant that much of the countrys resources were being used up, which could result in rising food prices. He pointed to several factors which indicated that the economy is nearing full capacity, including the increase in headline inflation (from 5.5 per cent at the beginning of 2014 to 8.5 per cent in December 2014) and the low unemployment rate (three per cent) which he said could drive up private sector wages as businesses were unable to find skilled workers. The pickup in headline inflation is mainly due to food price inflation, which remained in double-digit territory (almost 17 per cent) for the sixth successive month in December 2014. The acceleration in food prices largely reflects rising prices for locally produced vegetables and fruits, Rambarran noted. The Business Express sought the views of the business community as well as economists on the matter. They highlighted the need for diversification as well as an in-depth look at the countrys productivity levels. Diversification critical The University of the West Indies economist and lecturer Dr Roger Hosein said the signs that the countrys economy is approaching full capacity have been there from as early as 2007 to 2008. The situation has since become more dynamic and the signs of full capacity that remain may need much closer examination. Indeed at this stage a number of factors seem to be indicating that the medium term prospects for the T&T economy is one of a new normal, he said. In the time period 2009-2014 real economic activity averaged -0.005 per cent and in the period 2003-2008 averaged 8.13 per cent. In the time period 1997-2002 real economic activity averaged 5.5 per cent. Even more amidst this stagnating level of economic activity the number of people employed increased although the unemployment rate fell. This is no doubt because of greater employment by the State. Worryingly, in this time period government expenditures and transfers and subsidies also increased sharply and the gross public sector debt also climbed, he added. He said the sharp fall in the price of oil and gas and the weakened external strength of these commodities, as the international energy market undergoes a shale gas and shale oil overhaul, point towards a need for diversification. In this setting there is a need for civil society, the mass media and academia in the remaining months of this election cycle to challenge the political parties to make diversification a front burner issue and to pursue it more aggressively than ever done in the last few decades. More focus on productivity Economist Dr Ronald Ramkissoon believes more attention should be placed on Trinidad and Tobagos productivity levels. Noting that this countrys unemployment rate is just under four per cent, which he said in economic terms means that the country is at full employment, Ramkissoon raised concern that there is little or no economic growth. Early last year, the Central Bank projected 2.5 per cent. However Governor Rambarran noted that because of the dismal performance of the energy sector growth for 2014 was estimated at just 0.8 per cent. We have had marginal growth over the last few years so one then has to ask how can we be at full employment of capital and labour yet we are not booming in respect of growth Ramkissoon said. I think there is need for an analysis of the relationship of the data and of the relationship between the employment of capital, the employment of labour and economic growth, he stated. It is possible that there is full employment but that productivity is extremely low, so we might find we are employing a fair amount of capital and labour but that it is not generating any major increases in output which suggests that in local parlance we might be spinning top in mud, he added. Ramkissoon said the issue of productivity must also be looked at when it comes to the governments make-work programmes such as Unemployment ReliefProgramme(URP) and the Community-Based Environmental Protection and Enhancement Programme (CEPEP). Agricultural rehabilitation President of the American Chamber of Commerce Hugh Howard believes the rehabilitation of the countrys agricultural sector will result in lower food imports which will then result in decreased food prices and lower demand for foreign exchange. If you look at our manufacturing sector it has done fairly well particularly as we were able to corner the whole of the Caribbean market under the Caricom arrangement. But a lot of the inputs into manufacturing, when you look at food and beverages, a lot of the stuff we import. So unless we take agriculture seriously that heavy demand for foreign exchange will continue. He added: They only way that you can find yourself with enough foreign exchange, particularly with the price of oil trending downwards, is to export more non-oil and gas goods and services. It becomes absolutely necessary for Government and private sector to get together to collaboratively determine what aspects can Trinidad and Tobago seriously be competitive with, what are the demands internationally for goods and services, where we can have a comparative advantage and get out there and seriously market those goods and services to improve the inflow of foreign exchange. What Rambarran said: There are signs the Trinidad and Tobago economy seems to be approaching full capacity. This is reflected in the movement of a number of economic indicators. Headline inflation is creeping up, reaching 8 per cent in December 2014 from the 5 per cent at the start of the year. The pickup in headline inflation is mainly due to food price inflation, which remained in double-digit territory (almost 17 per cent) for the sixth successive month in December 2014. The acceleration in food prices largely reflects rising prices for locally produced vegetables and fruits. Unemployment is exceptionally low at a little over three per cent of the labour force, with the business community reporting shortages of skilled workers which could push up wages in the private sector. Consumer credit continues to expand at a strong pace, helping to finance substantial imports of consumer durables and contributing towards significant excess demand pressures in the foreign exchange market. In the face of declining crude oil prices, the Government substantially revised downwards its energy price assumptions for the 2014/2015 Budget, but it intends to return to the original fiscal deficit target of roughly 2 per cent of GDP. This suggests the Government is likely to maintain its expansionary fiscal stance that would further add to elevated liquidity levels (currently around $6 billion) and push up core inflation. The positive momentum in the non-energy sector has delivered fairly respectable growth for 15 consecutive quarters to December 2014 and the near-term outlook is for continued steady performance in non-energy output. Boosted in part by strengthening growth in the United States and softer oil prices, the tourism-based economies of CARICOM should see some uptick in activity in 2015, providing further support to Trinidad and Tobagos non-energy exports. Central Bank has put in place a programme of intensified open market operations to aggressively remove excess liquidity from the banking system in coming months in order to support its Repo rate adjustments. Larger and more frequent foreign exchange interventions aimed at preventing systemic foreign exchange shortfalls will indirectly contribute to absorbing some of the excess liquidity. Central Bank is prepared to further position its monetary policy stance to address any challenges that may arise from unanticipated changes in global energy markets.

Ellen Lewis with her beautiful daughters, from left, Kenya who attends Hillview College, the youngest Rosalind who attends Bishop Antsey High School East and the eldest Skylar who is studying medicine. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is warning that an economic speedbump could hamper the pace of global economic recovery in developed and developing countries. Central Bank Governor Ewart Williams brought that information to the 4th Biennial International Business, Banking and Finance evening reception at the University of the West Indies principal's home at St Augustine last Wednesday. While this hiccup was mainly due to be greater than expected, US-based weak economic climate, emerging markets in Asia and Latin America heated up, but were now facing an inflation rate that kept pace with their growth. \\\"The Caribbean economies are still digging themselves out of the global crisis of 2008 and unfortunately the recovery of the region is lagging behind that of other developing countries,\\\" Williams said. Statistics from the World Bank paint a dismal picture; in 1980 the Caribbean's average per capita income was twice as high as the average for developing countries, whereas today it is only a third higher. \\\"Countries in the region have been growing at an average rate of two per cent per year while small island states have been growing at an average rate of 3.6 per cent per year, roughly the average for the world economy,\\\" he said. Williams said if the major economic players sought to reverse that trend, they would have to address the long-term viability. \\\"The region faces the reality that it has lost some comparative advantage at a time when the global economy has become less friendly,\\\" he said. Williams expanded on what constituted the \\\"less friendly\\\" atmosphere. \\\"The traditional preferences fro bananas and sugar are now practically at an end and the region still finds itself unable to compete with lower-cost producers. Second, foreign aid flows to the region, with the exception of Haiti, have all be dried up. Third, while Caribbean tourism continues to be a viable brand, the region is facing stiffer competition from Asian destinations and will experience even greater competitive pressure when Cuba is fully opened up, as it would in the not too distant future,\\\" Williams noted. He also said the prospect of high unemployment in the United States and the United Kingdom for the next two to three years will have \\\"implications for workers remittances\\\" which are important to regional economies. Added to those strains, Williams said most countries in the Caribbean already have \\\"unsustainably high debt burdens\\\". \\\"This limits the extent to which Government spending could lead to recovery,\\\" he said. Williams said Trinidad and Tobago could be seen as an exception to that prevalent theme given the local energy resources and the stronger public finances and lower public debt burden. But while he gave hope in one breath, he tempered it with the other. \\\"Our proven energy reserves are fast dwindling and our fiscal space is being steadily reduced, the more private sector remains subdued and government steps in to lead the recovery. While public sector indebtedness is still at a comfortable level, it too is increasing rapidly to meet the high cost of the CLF/CLICO bailout,\\\" he said. \\\"In the period 2002-2006, real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) increased at an annual rate of close to ten per cent based on an annual growth of 16.7 per cent in the energy sector and 5.6 per cent per year in the non-energy sector,\\\" he said. Williams said the bottom line was that the entire region needed to embark on a new private-sector led growth strategy to ensure medium-term economic viability. He noted that the two largest Caricom members, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. were ranked 81st and 97th out of 183 countries in the latest Doing Business Report, which is published by the World Bank and the IFC. \\\"The Global Competitive Index for 23010-2011 shows Barbados ranked at 43rd and the rest of the Caribbean ranked between 84, which was Trinidad and Tobago and 110th among 139 countries. William said the plus side was that the region was at a \\\"cross road of opportunity\\\" where the right combination of leadership, vision and commitment could help overcome the challenges. \\\"I am convinced that closer regional integration must be part of the solution and then we would need partnerships between the public and private sectors and other stakeholders including labour and our tertiary education. We need all hands on deck,\\\" he said.

However, the region's economic history, marked by the phenomenon of the plantation economy, inhibits such investment. In the region's resource-based economies (petroleum, bauxite, tropical agriculture) foreign investment normally plays the major role with the private sector investing in commerce. This is not a problem with a plantation economy; it is a defining characteristic. If T&T is to diversify its economy, i.e. provide other tradable goods and services off the plantation (including in energy) the driver of economic competitiveness has to be adequately financed, knowledge-based innovationnot cheap gas. This column has discussed centres of excellence (CoEs) and small manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) within a finance system that depends in the short to medium term on the Government's direct intervention. In some countries universities attempt to commercialise their research but encounter a fundamental mismatch between a traditional academic department, with staff accustomed to academic freedom, and a vehicle geared to the production and exploitation of intellectual property (IP) via spin-off companies. They try to force-fit these departments into this additional role by creating Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) to support these departments in IP management, marketing etc. The conflict remains in which the academic department needs to publish as quickly as possible its research results (generally not directed to the economic demands of its society) while the TTO seeks to maintain confidentiality of these results while the invention is assessed and decisions made as to its protection. Further, the university is usually free to set its own research goals. For example, it may decide that it is about its own financial gainset up a university consultancyor that it is in general in the pursuit of new knowledge to boost its reputation or even that its work should benefit the society at large. Many governments, though they support the universities financially, do not put specific demands on them as to economic development and prefer to see universities as helping to build a knowledge-based society via the activities of their graduates. Locally, then, a vehicle should be developed that is primarily about the production of knowledge and its transfer, inventions, innovations and spin-off companies. It must be very concerned about the protection of the relevant IP and provide support in marketing, market development and business together with the usual technological strength of an academic research department. Hence, this column has recommended the creation of CoEs which could be associated with our certification universities but dance to a different drumbeatcreating spin-off companiesSMEswhich will provide innovative economic development. The recurrent funding for such a centre is three-part. One is grant funding that allows the research and development team to accomplish the basic work from which the ideas for spin-off companies flow. Grant funding also allows the CoEs to produce a \\\"proof of concept\\\" or even a basic laboratory prototype of the new idea. These are used to convince interested persons that the idea has commercial merit. The CoE will then require seed money for the founders (CoE, inventors, the government etc.) to set up a separate company to produce the first commercial prototype and to begin to meet with potential customers and clients. The seed stage should remain within the CoE's business incubator since the inventors are required full time during this stage. In establishing this stage a business plan is of no significance since it is really not yet possible to identify its elements. The CoE should be aware that the project can fail at this stage, which is not altogether a catastrophe since it allows the inventors to go on to another project. If the seed phase is successful, then the company will be looking for venture capital, equity funding and progresses to a stage in which the company gets more commercial, employs adequate staff, develops a business plan and goes into production. At this stage the CoE spins out the company and retains an investment in it via at least its IP vested in the company. The company will require further equity injections at some stage, and so allow the venture capital company to exitoffer Initial Public Offers on the stock market. On examining the local marketplace, there is an absence of, and unwillingness by the private sector to, provide research grants of the magnitude required to undertake the CoE's research, seed or venture capital funding. If we are to establish T&T's innovation system then our Government on our behalf (despite Minister Mariano Browne's reliance on the private sector for this investment) has to become initially the financier of last resort in order to jump-start this economic diversification.

At this major international event, the movers and shakers of the world will attempt to chart a way forward for the developed and developing nations of the globe. The three pillars of sustainabilityeconomic, social and environmentalwill be at the heart of the summit and the various missions will be looking to maximise their own positions and gain as many concessions as possible. Trinidad and Tobago is yet to submit any position papers or documents for the summit. This meeting offers a golden opportunity to analyse the failures of our country to prepare for the transition into sustainable development. On this issue we are falling further and further behind the rest of the world. The summit recognises the need for a global effort to combat worldwide poverty and inequality, environmental crises and climate change, and boost economic growth. Despite the tremendous strides that have been made over the past decades in reducing poverty, inequality has grown and there are still billions of people living in abject misery. The news of the rise of the powerful BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) nations has been greeted with much enthusiasm from the developing world, but their rise has overshadowed the dire state many developing countries are in. These growing powers are unique, along with Turkey and some South East Asian nations, due to their large land mass and populations and substantial resource base. Most of the other developing nations have not been blessed with such abundant economic factors and have been struggling. Trinidad and Tobago is unique among the developing states due to its small size, political stability, good international credit rating and of course its abundance of natural resources. While many states are being burdened with having to import oil and gas, we have been richly blessed but we are not making the best use of our resources. Firstly, the world has come to recognise that natural resources will not last forever and there is a crucial need for investment in alternative energy sources. Many international banks and organisations have been granting generous subsidies and loans to nations that make the effort to invest in and develop alternative energy. Sadly, we are not on this list and it is very difficult for me to understand why. We have the income and finance, we have the facilities at the University of the West Indies and we have access to expertise from all over the worldfrom Germany to Brazil to Israel. We have abundant sunshine to begin a push toward solar powernot in the sense of replacing fossil fuels as a power base, but in helping citizens to outfit their homes with the technology to make use of solar power. These measures are already being used in places such as Germany and their sun exposure is nothing compared to ours. Other sources of power such as wind and wave can be seriously looked into, given our island status and exposure to steady winds off the Atlantic. Secondly, on the issue of poverty eradication, we are beginning to stall and even erode some of the amazing things we have accomplished. Our system is an interesting mix of free market and welfare. We have free health care and pharmaceuticals, we have free education and access to many other free services. We are, however, failing in delivering these services at a high quality and are not developing other much-needed systems. Our health care system is in a sorry state and, once again, we have the money and the expertise to fix it but we are lacking the will. Our free provision of HIV medication is extremely commendable, but many people are afraid to access them out of shame and the negative attitudes that pervade many public medical institutions. We are sorely lacking in dealing with mental conditions, addiction problems and stress. Our planners are concentrating too much on superficial buildings and projects, rather than investing in the population to eradicate poverty. We do not have enough jobs. Short-term programmes are not good enough. We do not have proper day care for young children and proper employment protection. Not enough is being done to provide affordable housing and not enough is being done to aid agricultural development and thus lower food prices. Then there is the issue of the environment. On this we are undoubtedly inadequate and should be deeply ashamed. Our environmental laws are a joke, illegal quarrying is still taking place but no one is doing anything. Houses are still being built without consideration for the environment. Farms and factories are polluting the rivers and seas with impunity. Cars and factories are belching toxins into the atmosphere. Vile, evil people are slaughtering pregnant leatherback turtles as they come on shore to nest after thousands of miles of swimming. The national bird has been mostly driven away. The average man and woman is still burning rubbish, engaging in illegal dumping and littering without a second thought. As a tiny tropical country, we should be taking pride on our pristine and spectacular beauty. Instead we have developed into a nation of people who care only about ourselves and our own pleasures. It is indeed sad that we will sit quietly during this summit where we could have shone as a brilliant star on the global stage. We have the resources, the knowledge, space and capacity to be a model nation, as close to utopia and a green country as is possible, but we are sorely lacking in political and popular will. It is indeed a shame that we are not living up to our full potential. Rajiv Gopie won the Presidents Medal in 2006 for business/modern studies.

I saw numbers for the third quarter. All the way in the back of the document, I saw a figure of minus 10 per cent of GDP growth for the third quarter, but when I look at the GDP for the entire year, it says 2.3 per cent, that is to say, the year 2016, so I find that rather puzzling. I couldn't quite understand that. I am not saying that the number is wrong but it seems to me that there is a discrepancy between the numbers for quarter one, quarter two, quarter three of 2016, and the numbers that they have for GDP for 2016 as a whole.\\u201d Second, he said: \\u201cI noticed the debt figure for the country at the end of 2016 is quite high, and again, I want to look at that carefully so that I can make sense of it, and also to look at the debt-to-GDP ratio and see what kind of jump we have made over the last 18 months.\\u201d Third, he said: \\u201cI think unemployment is higher than 4.4 per cent but they probably used the Central Statistical Office (CSO) figures which generally lag behind by two quarters, so the figure that you are seeing is not for March 2017 but really for September 2016. So if you did an estimate of what it's likely to be now, in March 2017, given the significant layoffs, losses of jobs and closure of businesses, with very few new hirings, except by the State, and very few, if any (new investments), I think the unemployment should be higher now but over the course of tomorrow, and Monday I will look at the figures more carefully and will give a more considered response in a day or two.\\u201d Financial consultant Ved Seereeram said: \\u201cI would question the low unemployment rate of around 4 per cent. Do remember that a report on poverty was published showing over 300,000 persons earning less than $1,000 per month.\\u201d Deferred Tax Assets will save us Seereeram said: \\u201cAlso striking was the rates Government is now paying on bonds, over 4 per cent compared to 2 per cent a short while ago. This will have significant impact on fixed income portfolios as the value of the portfolio will decline significantly while interest rates rise. Banks such as First Citizens, which has a large fixed income portfolio, would suffer significant losses, unless they do like Petrotrin and show the losses as a Deferred Tax Asset.\\u201d He added: \\u201cThere was no comment on the success or failure of Government's diversification plan. I thought this was important given our plight.\\u201d Seereeram said: \\u201cThe management of the foreign exchange is another major issue of great concern. I do not recall any emphasis on the projections for the stock of foreign exchange. There was no comment on the exchange rate and one would expect a comment if the regulators and Government are committed to a stable exchange rate for the foreseeable future.\\u201d Promising to make their statements in the weeks ahead, at least two other experts contacted by the Express, said they suspect political interference as the numbers in the Economic Bulletin's Appendix Tables as at March 9, 2017, are inconsistent with the numbers in the substantive document.

Last Tuesday, on the second day of the Trinidad and Tobago Energy Conference at the Hyatt Regency Trinidad hotel, Port of Spain, he suggested ways Caribbean countries like Trinidad and Tobago could protect themselves against global crises. Following is Dookeran's presentation to energy sector conference participants. Your Conference theme and timing are most appropriate for Trinidad and Tobago today. This is so as we come to grips with the global imbalances facing the world economy and as we embark upon new frontier industrialisation policies for Trinidad and Tobago. I believe it is the Chief Executive Officer of the Brazilian Company, Petrobras, Jose Gabrielli De Ascevedo who explained his country's challenge \\\"to direct international investment in association with local Brazilian companies to increase local content and in so doing to embrace large swathes of Brazilian industry\\\". This initiative has established Brazil as, perhaps the first sustainable bio fuels economy. Indeed, it is an expression of the new frontier industrial policies now required in today's global economy where new global imbalances are emerging. The global imbalances of which I speak are reflected on three fronts: in the simmering foreign exchange currency wars visibly noticed in the current \\\"on and off\\\" tension between the United States of America and China , realignment of currencies in the world the re-emergence of new food crisis resulting from the growing gap between supply and demand and this is transmitted to countries of the world, especially those which are heavily dependent on the importation of food or the raw material needed for the production of such food; and the continued ripples in oil and gas prices as the duo-politics of the world energy sector shifts to changes in technology The imbalances of which I speak, would indicate clearly what are some of the challenges facing countries like ours. The new fire storm in Egypt must indeed be occupying the minds of world leaders of countries trading in oil and gas as we do here, in Trinidad and Tobago. These global imbalances are indeed a reflection of the changing political order and small countries like ours must be prepared to anticipate and, as far as possible, develop policy actions to protect our economy and the well-being of our people. Let me start this dialogue with a very penetrating question and giving you a provocative answer. What is holding back growth and development in the Caribbean This is the question asked by a Caribbean scholar, Avinash Persaud. Prof Persaud, in a chapter in a forthcoming publication: \\\"Power, Politics and Performance\\\" answered the question himself. He argues that the Anti-growth coalition, so deeply embedded in the socio-economic and political culture in the small states of the Caribbean must be 'broken', before any growth and development can take place. Reflect on the term \\\"anti-growth coalition\\\" that is embedded in today's society must be broken before any growth and development can take place. The challenge therefore, for policy-makers, development takers, practitioners and those engaged in the field of economic change is How do we break the Anti-growth coalition In a practical sense I, as Minister of Finance have at great odds been striving to restore the national balance sheet of Trinidad and Tobago as a basis and precondition for igniting growth in our economy. Yes, there are challenges, the $13 billion CLICO settlement, the vexing problem of public sector wage negotiations and the meeting of bills in the construction sector. These are the clouds to be cleared before we can see blue skies again. Ahead of us is the rising food price inflation now being further fuelled by the world food crisis but, uppermost in our mind is, indeed how to trigger a new growth momentum in the economy of Trinidad and Tobago. We are fortunate that our efforts have begun to be acknowledged first by the full restoration of our sovereign A A credit rating by a major rating agency Standard and Poors (which, incidentally, recently down-graded Japan's sovereign debt) and changed our economic outlook from a \\\"negative downside\\\" risk to being \\\"stable\\\". This view was echoed in the International Monetary Fund's recent Board Meeting where the economic outlook while recognising the weakening economic situation saw the economic outlook for Trinidad and Tobago as positive. This is what it says: \\\"Directors supported the 2010/11 budget, which is appropriately geared toward reinvigorating the economy, and encouraged the authorities to accelerate its implementation. They agreed that once the economic recovery is well established, fiscal policy should aim towards reducing public debt and rebuilding buffers in the medium term. This objective could be achieved by reversing the large increases in current expenditures that occurred during the boom years, while ensuring adequate social spending and investment to promote economic diversification. They also called for strengthening of tax administration.\\\" This Government is firmly committed to build on this platform and to do so to confront the hurdles ahead of us or whether it reflects itself in short-term political impulses or whether it reflects itself in medium-term challenges to technology, management and competitiveness.The critical pillars for growth is indeed in the energy and investment sector, the very theme of your Conference this year. The recent fragility of our economic performance must not hide the underlying strength of our economy and Trinidad and Tobago's development potential. The 2010 Budget Statement emphasises the search for new economic space which is reflected in our strategy for growth pole development in the South West peninsula, Central Trinidad, North Coast development, Tobago and Port of Spain East. Underlying this development strategy is a supportive fiscal environment for new investment and a new programme of public offerings as we build a vibrant capital market and create new frontiers for the ownership of public enterprises. The challenge of change requires us to depart from the premises of past development strategies and embrace sustainable programmes. These are the underlying premises upon which the new frontier industrialisation strategy is being constructed. That strategy is premised on four basic points: 1) Re-invigorate seismic research to identify potential resources of hydro-carbon as we seek to expand private seismic data to an open data room and set the basis for renewed exploration in the hydro-carbon sector; 2) Develop an aggressive programme based on finance, technology and management to make Trinidad and Tobago's economy more competitive and, in this regard, the Government has recently established the National Competitiveness Council along with the Economic Development Board to chart the new frontier ahead of us. Implicit here, is the need to speed up our decision making and we are already engaged in a programme to improve our ratings and the ease of doing business. Much of these changes require the deep professional bond, strong political commitment and a clear direction which must be embraced by all; 3) Our international promotional effort for new investment in the on-shore and off-shore development must now expand our global reach to include Indian, Chinese and Brazilian investment prospects. As such, a new era of economic diplomacy will now inform our efforts to vigorously seek investments to support the new direction in our development strategy; and finally 4) No longer must we view the energy sector as a privileged enclave of a few but, indeed, we must move to the democratisation of this sector in search of opportunities to finance new economic space in our quest for inclusive development. These premises are the main ingredients for the new frontier industrialisation policy in which we are about to embark. True, the energy sector will remain a dominant factor driving this economy and we anticipate a growing contribution to the finances of this country by your deeper involvement in the petroleum industry of Trinidad and Tobago. You will appreciate the words of my friend, Watson Duke \\\"I want meh money right now\\\" and you will realise that I am the Minister in the kitchen over the hot stove. So we must be in a rush to open up the Green Fund for environmental sustainability and not close the door to any of our citizens for a share in the stake of this nation's patrimony. It is for this reason that as we construct the new frontier, we must not only find investment opportunities for monetising our gas, but, place a new battery to confront the problems of persistent poverty, not by treating the symptoms but by removing the cycles of poverty. So let me conclude by focusing very briefly on the issue of poverty and building opportunities for those who have been excluded from economic main-stream. Hereto, the new investors must accept a shared responsibility so that the \\\"new face of hunger\\\" must be confronted by the development of a truly entrepreneurial economy. The emergence of the entrepreneurial economy as a driver of growth and sustainable development will become and must be a shared responsibility by all the stakeholders in our society. It is in this context therefore, that we have taken specific measures for the development of the entrepreneurial economy, once described by Arthur Lewis as the missing link of development of Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean, by initiating a rethinking of the process of wealth creation, income distribution and poverty eradication. We shall also, in so doing, attempt to bring to the fore, the opportunities that respond to the global imbalances and we are looking very carefully, at this point in time, at measures to mitigate against the expected increase of world food prices and its impact on our local situation. Many measures have been good formed and we are now considering how, within the framework of the market economy, to enhance the prospect of dealing with expected increases in food prices. Much of that depends also on domestic policy considerations and that too has been given a new impetus by the fiscal measures that we have introduced such as development of agricultural production in Trinidad and Tobago and by the supportive measures we have put into place to encourage global food production. My friends and members of this esteemed audience, I consider it a genuine privilege to be invited to be here to share these thoughts with you at this time, and in this country, as we begin to embark on the rebuilding of a new confidence on the restoration of growth. I feel confident that the ground work is being carefully laid. As the chairman said, \\\"I am not in this alone.\\\" I am in this and the government is also in this with a new mandate and with your support and with so much good men and external support, I feel confident that as we approach this exercise in the framework of the many stakeholders in our country, we will be able to find the right doors opening for investments and investments in the energy sector, notwithstanding the difficulties that we sometimes come across. This generation, in this 21st century, in the turning point of the politics of this nation, as we begin to turn the corner we must not hold back growth and development but we must indeed break the anti-growth coalition that has dominated Caribbean societies. We must do so within the framework of a democratic system functioning at its best. Your conference must not only be challenged to embrace this new frontier but to reflect on the real challenges facing us as is our society in an increasingly turbulent world. We will do this not with the old victim of \\\"seeking what we can get\\\" but with the new vision of \\\"being inspired by what we can be\\\".

They are actually weighing their options extremely closely. \\u201cThey are looking at many factors, not only political stability, not only economic stability, the openness of the society, the quality of the labour force, the level of education, and level of literacy, they are looking at all types of factors and variables in making a determination as to where they can invest their money or where they can allow their names and their brand to be associated with a particular jurisdiction,\\u201d Sinckler said. The Finance Minister said that in spite of the economic challenges Barbados faced over the last few years, it had still been able to attract high quality foreign direct investment, such as Burger King, suggesting that spoke volumes for the country. \\u201cEven more interestingly, it also speaks about the confidence in the capacity of our domestic business people to be able to carry international brands to the standard that we expect. The expansion of this franchise here in Barbados is proving that we as Barbados are not out of the game, we are very much in the game. \\u201cThe people who have invested here have expressed that level of confidence that Barbados can continue to grow and do well if we apply all the things we know that are necessary in the context of building successful businesses, successful communities and ultimately a successful country,\\u201d Sinckler added.

The report stresses that, while the economic situation is tough, the constant flow of depressing headlines may be making finance professionals even more pessimistic than conditions actually justify. Three quarters of the 2,873 professionals who took part in the Global Economic Conditions Survey between August 19 and September 7, 2011, thought global economic conditions were deteriorating or stagnating. Nearly half, (49 per cent) had lost confidence in the economic prospects of their own organisations, while a similar percentage (45 per cent) thought their governments were not dealing correctly with current economic challenges. ACCA believes that much of the drop in confidence, especially in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, is down to a flow of bad news rather than the economic fundamentals, which have deteriorated only slightly in the past three months. Brenda Lee Tang, head of ACCA Caribbean, said: \\\"The weakening in demand and deteriorating access to finance reported by accountants were not sharp enough to justify the strong negative sentiment which they expressed. But after taking into account the effects that fear for the future will have on their views, the evidence still points to falling economic activity in the developed nations and a sharp slowdown in emerging economies. \\\"The drop in confidence could be seen as a result of people waking up to trends which have accumulated for the past year or more. Globally, demand has proven to be too weak to sustain reliable growth, investment refuses to pick up and inflation remains high. And on top of everything else, it's still unclear whether the sovereign debt crisis in Europe can be contained, or indeed what it will mean if it cannot,\\\" she said. Although all regions except the Middle East are now in negative territory in terms of both economic and business confidence, ACCA said it was particularly conscious of developments in the Asia-Pacific region, which once led the world into recovery. After falling steadily for more than a year, confidence levels in the region are now comparable to, if not lower than, those in Europe, and economies which undertaken more international trade (such as Singapore or Hong Kong) appear to be the worst hit. The picture in the Americas GECS readings for the Americas, where there were 182 respondents, are generally close to the global average, but the complexity of the region is significant. Generally, respondents in the Caribbean were more confident about the prospects of their organisations than their North American colleagues (20% reporting confidence gains versus 12%), even though their view of the global economy was decidedly gloomier (73% v. 63% anticipating deterioration or stagnation). In North America, both demand and access to finance appear to be improving, while cashflow problems and business failures are down. The labour market is becoming more subdued and less dynamic. In the Caribbean, on the other hand, demand is weaker and so business opportunities tend to mostly focus on niche markets or serving the needs of cost-conscious customers. That said, the outlook for investment is improving, which could provide a much needed boost to demand.

And new economic measures meant to secure the bailout are forecast to put the country, which emerged last year from six years of economic decline, through more misery.No one is producing. No one is buying. Everyone is scared, said 59-year-old Dimitris Farmakis, who has a cloth-making firm in Athens.On top of a slump in demand, Farmakis business is hit hard by a government limit on money transfers that makes it impossible to buy supplies from overseas. Hes cut down on production and given his staff time off.In a few weeks we wont be producing due to these shortages, Farmakis said.Farmakis woes are commonplace in an economy that analysts estimate will contract by about four per cent this year.Thats a big reverse from just six months ago, when it had emerged from one of the most savage recessions the developed world has seen in modern history. Its public finances were also healing and the country was even considering financing itself once again on international bond markets.Rip up that script.Greece fell back into recession in the spring amid growing uncertainty over the countrys future in the euro in the wake of the election triumph of the radical left Syriza party in January. As the bailout talks dragged on, concerns became more acute and the recession deepened, evidence suggests. The governments decision over two weeks ago to shutter all banks, impose limits on cash withdrawals at ATMs for Greeks, and restrict electronic transfers abroad dealt a huge blow to an economy that was already reeling.Bankruptcies are on the rise: bad loans on banks books are expected to surge to account for 40-45 per cent of all loans, from 35 percent in December, according to Moodys credit rating agency.Money has been pulled out in droves from the country over the past months of uncertainty. Deposits hit an 11-year low in May and analysts say it will take time for investors to find the courage to plow money back into the country, even if it has a rescue deal.The public debt load is unsustainable at around 180 percent of GDP or 320 billion euros and forecast to rise over the next two years as the economy weakens, the International Monetary Fund warned this week.Meanwhile, the budget savings the government will have to make to get the financial bailout from its European creditors will hurt economic growth. They include, among other things, tax increases that are likely to dent spending.Greece has already gone through (a) depression, said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. This ensures theyll go through three more years of recession if its implemented.The Greek government, and many experts, say the bailout deal is needed to avoid the even worse scenario of a complete collapse in Greeces banks, which would push the country out of the euro. Economists estimate that if Greece falls out of the currency union, its economy could shrink by another ten or 20 per cent.The government also notes that the bailout deal will ensure the countrys funding for three years and includes a promise to lighten its debt burden.In the short-term, it is needed to help the banks reopen, a priority for the economy to start breathing again.Imports in Greece have been hammered by the limits on money transfers that the government imposed two weeks ago to prevent a bank run. Business owners are warning there could be shortages of basic goods such as food if the situation isnt resolved and banks arent reopened.Exporters are also experiencing problems as many are unable to buy raw materials from abroad, while others say they cannot pay for agricultural products.Its a huge problem, were now only receiving from abroad the products that have already been imported and paid for, said Natassa Voudouri, owner of Contlift, which transports goods from shipping containers around Greece. From here on, things get harder ... The reason is that no money transfer can be sent abroad from Greece. At the moment were taking delivery of the last goods, which is food. All the rest is frozen and were expecting product shortages.Pantelis Kourbelas, owner of fashion company Ioanna Kourbela, which exports to 25 countries, is being creative as he tries to import thread and material from Italy and France.If we cant buy raw materials because we cant send money abroad we will have a problem, said Kourbelas, 62, who is also on the board of the Athens Traders Association. Were thinking of opening a bank account in another European country and all our transactions with clients who buy from us to be done through that account. Thats the only way we can ensure the continuation of production.While a rescue deal could allow Greece to ease its money controls somewhat, the country is unlikely to be able to undo them completely the last eurozone nation to impose such controls, Cyprus, took two years to lift them fully.

The 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that destroyed part of the Asian business giant's northeast coast could also lead to higher prices of commodities such as wheat, which may trickle down to the region. Goods coming out of Japan could also reflect the change. \\\"I am sensing a realignment of the currency between Japan and the United States,\\\" the acting Prime Minister said during a telephone interview on Saturday. \\\"It could happen. If it does, we could see an increase in prices of commodities coming out of Japan. Locally, that would mostly affect the auto industry directly. In terms of commodities, it would eventually indirectly affect is, if it were to happen.\\\" Dookeran said, however, there is a possibility that natural gas prices could go up as a result of the disaster, from which this country could benefit. \\\"Since nuclear power may now be in short supply, it is possible that we will see a short term rise in natural gas prices, which will be a positive for us,\\\" he said. Japan was up to late last week fighting to prevent a meltdown at its Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, where the reactor has overheated several times since the disaster after a series of explosions destroyed its core cooling mechanisms. Up to late yesterday, Japanese authorities said engineers had managed to lay a cable to Reactor no.2 and were hopeful of reconnection to the power grid, which would restart the pumps that cool the core. A 20-kilometre Exclusion Zone is still in effect around the plant amidst fears of a radiation leaks. Dookeran said the Government has continued its partnership with the Red Cross Society, through which donations can be made to aid in the relief of those in Japan affected by the disaster. \\\"We are allowing donations to pass through them (Red Cross) and we encourage citizens to take part,\\\" Dookeran said. He added this country has not so far been able to reap any benefits from the increased oil prices of the last quarter but this could change if the increase is sustained throughout this fiscal quarter. \\\"It was as we had projected for the first quarter but we have not been able to benefit yet,\\\" Dookeran said. Local oil production has also not been as vibrant as was hoped, further inhibiting profit. \\\"We might lose out because of low production but that depends on whether the price is sustained for this quarter,\\\" Dookeran said.

I think the government is well intentioned (in its attempts at improving bureaucratic inefficiency) and I commend Trade Minister Vasant Bharath for his work. But we need to take the next step in making policy changes happen: implementation from a crime perspective, and a business perspective to ensure we are all on the same page. Many other countries are trying to diversify just as we are. Those who will win are those with the ability to implement, ANSA McAL chief operating officer Gerry Brooks tells the Business Express. Brooks was speaking during an interview at the Tatil Building the groups Maraval Road, Port of Spain offices after the company announced its financial results for 2012 last Tuesday. I think the way forward is hard work. I think (Finance Minister Larry Howai) should come forward on a quarterly basis to give updates on where we are relative to the plans announced. We also need to prioritise our focus, he said. The key is now to translate budgetary promises and governance into action on the ground in various sectors. We have to navigate volatility and have a well balanced portfolio. Brooks notes there are several positives in the local economy: the strong foreign exchange reserves ($9.2 billion or about a years import cover); a healthy Heritage and Stabilisation Fund ($4 billion). Nevertheless, there are serious challenges. Crime continues to be a deterrent, and Brooks warns about the potential impact the continuing increase of crime in society will have on foreign direct investment, as well as the loss of human capital, and the additional burden on security costs to manufacturers that will inevitably pass to the consumer. The Port also continues to be a perennial hindrance to exporters, and one of the main hindrances against the ease of doing business in Trinidad and Tobago. When you are trying to export in the last quarter and the Port lacks efficiency, you will have afforded shelf space in a key market and you simply cannot export your goods. What happens is that space is taken by someone else. Then you will have to contend with the security of the distributor who is handling your product, he said. Brooks was optimistic about the potential of public/private sector partnerships (PPPs), especially regarding the nations ports, but said it was important that the role of each player was clearly articulated. Philosophically we support (PPP). In maritime for example, post-Panama Canal expansion vessels will provide a great opportunity to develop that sector and the capacity of our port. Our port is way below the standards of several other ports in the region and internationally, including Jamaica. How we engage capital, dredging, port infrastructure and services, engagement of the union, and activity and turns is something we need to spend time on and in some cases, respectfully, we believe the government needs to step aside and let the private sector take over because we are better equipped to do some of these services; they can take their stake in the form of taxes, he said. There is also the problem of absenteeism and labour legislation in the local work environment. We have got to take a fresh look at labour legislation to modernise it, because a key element is to have the right labour stock and for that labour stock to be productive and support what we want to do drive competitiveness, he says, adding that he is not placing blame on anyone, but it should be an obligation that all major partieslabour, the government and the private sectorhave to come together in a new transformative manner in order to implement change. Brooks said there also needed to be speedier implementation of policies including licences for relevant State authorities in the construction sector; procurement legislation; the beverage container bill; the single electronic window (SEW) for Government approvals; and construction codes, especially in the event of natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes. There must be the alignment of State agencies, labour and productivity and enabling legislation to support agencies to ensure strategies we put in place really come to life to transform the economy. Because its been three or four years where weve either had negative growth or flat growth. It is very important that the diversification thrust take root so we can begin to move and catalyse the economy, he said. Despite the setbacks faced by the countrysand regions largest conglomerate, ANSA McAL, has its sights set on expansion. We are very focused on growth. We think we have just begun to touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the businesss potential and certainly it is one something we feel can certainly make it on to the Fortune 1,000. But we plan to do so step by step, account by account, business by business. There are some brands we feel are capable of international penetration into key markets and we want to ensure we can leverage those brands from an international perspective and grow them. We have substantial cash generatedover $1.3 billion in free cashand very little debt. We have a mix of organic growth and inorganic, acquisition led opportunity, Brooks said. ANSA McAL recorded revenues last year of $5.9 billion12 per cent over the previous years $5.3 billion. Profit before tax was $952 million, up five per cent from 2011s $905 million. We are going to grow step by step, very deliberately and very carefully. We have a good group regionally, with a significant macroeconomic impact and multiplier effect in many of the territories in which we operate, so we have a responsibility to grow the business responsibly and profitably, he said. The 130-year old company has an asset base of over $11 billion, with approximately 6,000 employees. Its business operations span the manufacturing, brewing, insurance, finance, real estate, media, shipping, trading/ distribution, automotive and industrial equipment retailing sectors. The company also operates subsidiaries throughout the region, including in Barbados, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, Guyana, Grenada and the USA. The company is listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (AMCL: $66.71). Several of its subsidiaries are also listed, including ANSA Merchant Bank (AMBL: $37.53); Guardian Holdings Ltd (GHL: $19.50); and Guardian Media Ltd (GML: $19.26). We are responsible for about 15 per cent of the capitalised value of the TTSE. In taxes, we probably pay about $1 billion, so we are the largest taxpayer outside the energy sector. And in many territories we are significant employers. Our contribution should not only be measured in financial terms, but also in social terms and I simply want to commend the Anthony N Sabga Awards, which have significantly contributed to scholarships throughout the region and helping to catalyse innovation, thinking and research, which I think is integral for development of territories, Brooks said. In 2013, Brooks, who also wears the hat of manufacturing sector head, envisions the group continuing its momentum for growth: We are going to ensure our governance structure is strong. We think we have good people, and we are going to use our resources. We will try to execute our strategies well, focusing on customer service and satisfaction. We are going to utilise technology to maintain our high standards of products and services, with the right infrastructure to deliver and improve our brands and our results, he said. But its an overall strategy. Brooks says the company doesnt distinguish one sector from the other: all divisions are important for holistic growth. We treat all our businesses equally because we are excited about the potential of all of them. There are some obvious onesthe beverage business; financial services; weve made substantial investments in our manufacturing; in automotive weve made some new acquisitions especially in luxury brands. Our governance structure causes each sector head to look at each and really try to exploit the organic and inorganic opportunities there. We feel there are tremendous opportunities in all our sectors and will work to improve them, Brooks said.

The most immediate effects will be felt in Britain. But economists say the ripples could be felt much farther afield. Companies will wonder whether to invest or locate in Britain during the years-long negotiations to define new trade conditions with the EU, its biggest business partner. Across Europe, trade and immigration may lose ground to nationalism and protectionism. The EU itself, minus market-oriented Britain, may turn to more government intervention and regulation. Other countries may eventually seek to leave the bloc. \\\"A new set of economic circumstances has been created, which the world will have to deal with,\\\" said India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. \\\"Volatility is the new norm. And therefore, economies have to learn to live with crisis after crisis.\\\" The global economy isn't in a crisis right at the moment, but growth is muted and uneven among countries. The International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of 3.5 percent for this year. The Chinese economy is slowing, the U.S. recovery has hit a slower patch, major emerging economies like Brazil are in recession, and Europe and Japan are stagnating. That's not good enough to bring people out of poverty or get them jobs. Unemployment remains at a high 10.2 percent in the 19 countries that use the euro; in the U.S. it's a lower 5.5 percent, but the labor participation rate has not recovered since the recession of 2008-9, indicating many workers have not benefited from the stronger U.S. recovery. Here's a look at what the vote means for the world economy. ___ ECONOMIC GROWTH The most direct economic pain will be felt by the U.K., while the direct consequences for the world economy are likely to be more moderate. Moody's Analytics estimates that global economic output would be 0.25 percent smaller after five years than it otherwise would have been, while the EU would be a full percent smaller and the U.K. 4 percent. Then there are indirect events. Stock market plunges can make people feel poorer and less likely to spend. Uncertainty can make executives put off investments in new production. \\\"Uncertainty certainly impedes investment decisions, and with few signs of any pickup in the global economy we're probably going to see a slower rebound in capital spending,\\\" said Sara Johnson, senior research director of global economics with HIS Global Insight. ___ CENTRAL BANKS The market plunges following the vote are one reason for the world's central banks to keep their rock-bottom interest rates in place. \\\"Brexit could be a game changer for central bank thinking,\\\" Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, wrote in a research note. The Federal Reserve is less likely to raise short-term interest rates this year \\u2014 and might even have to cut them. Greene predicted that the Bank of England could have to print money to finance government spending, tax cuts or both and that the Bank of Japan could follow. The European Central Bank could have to expand its current bond-buying stimulus program. ___ THE LONDON LILY PAD Many big companies use the U.K. as a base for their European operations. London's strength as a banking center is in part based on easy access to financial markets in Europe. Regulatory approval to do business in the British capital means an all-access pass to the other 27 EU countries, a process called passporting. Global banks like JP Morgan Chase have already said that they would have to move jobs from London to the European mainland if Britain leaves the EU. ___ CONSUMERS, TRAVELLERS The pound and euro both dropped Friday, which should make British and eurozone exports cheaper overseas. American travelers heading to Britain and the rest of Europe are going to find cheaper meals, hotels, souvenirs and museum admissions because the U.S. dollar will go farther against a weaker pound and euro. Airfare for peak summer months probably won't dip but any taxes and fees levied in Europe will be cheaper. For instance, all coach passengers leaving the U.K. for the U.S. pay 73 pounds for the Air Passenger Duty. That tax is now cheaper. ___ TRADE The impact on UK-EU trade would depend on how quick and amicable negotiations are on a new set of relations. Britain could wind up like Switzerland, which simply adopts EU requirements without having any say in how they are decided. Britain sends 44 percent of its exports to the EU, less than any other member country but still quite significant. The price for continued market access, however, could be allowing free movement of workers. A desire to control immigration was a major force behind the \\\"leave\\\" campaign, so it's unclear if such an agreement could ever be reached. \\\"If the U.K. takes a tougher stance on immigration, for businesses this will be a disaster as the EU will retaliate,\\\" said Christian Stadler, professor of strategic management at the Warwick Business School in Coventry, Britain. \\\"Access to the EU will become difficult. For some companies this means doing business in Europe won't be attractive anymore.\\\" \\\"Others will have to deal with complicated bureaucracy,\\\" he said. \\\"In short: a nightmare.\\\" ___ MARKETS Stock markets plunged on Friday, with Germany's DAX falling almost 7 percent, the Dow 2.6 percent and Britain's FTSE 3.2 percent. The pound hit a 31-year low. Outside of the U.K., however, that turmoil may not last. Analysts at Oxford Economics think the global market reaction and fears of an EU breakup are exaggerated. Today's drops \\\"are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the U.K. \\u2014 at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5 percent of world output.\\\" ___ POLITICAL DOMINOES The British vote have a much broader impact if becomes a political turning point away from trade and economic integration. In economic terms, free trade is considered a plus for growth. It should mean bigger markets, lower consumer prices and more competition. Yet those advantages can quickly be forgotten if people feel that the benefits are not fairly distributed, or that their jobs are left unprotected and move to other, lower-cost countries. Many a British exit could embolden anti-EU, anti-immigration political movements such as the Front National in France. Its leader, Marine Le Pen, is already considered likely to make the final round of presidential elections next year. Geert Wilders, head of the anti-Islam, anti-EU Freedom Party in the Netherlands, called Friday for a referendum on the EU there, too. And it goes beyond Europe. Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee for U.S. president, has described the free trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico as \\\"a disaster.\\\" Likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has said the U.S. should \\\"renegotiate deals that are not working for Americans\\\" and if necessary reject a proposed trade deal with Asian countries if it doesn't show clear benefits for raising wages and jobs. \\\"In the US there is a clear parallel between the rise of Donald Trump... and what is going on in the U.K. and the rest of Europe,\\\" said Rob Carnell, U.S. economist at ING-DiBa. \\\"The recovery has left large swathes of the population behind, and this is their protest.\\\" \\\"I think this vote has been a vote against open and integrated societies, quite frankly,\\\" said Guntram Wolff, director of the Breugel think tank in Brussel. \\\"And I think the sentiment in many other European countries...would be to say, we will not counter that, we are so fearful, that we will basically try to counter populism by following the same road and be more protectionist.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

A woman talks to Brazil\\u0092s President Dilma Rousseff, who is running for re-election for the Workers Party (PT), as Rousseff makes a campaign stop at a popular restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, last Wednesday. RIO DE JANEIRO Brazils formerly high-flying economy, once the darling of emerging markets, has fallen into recession, according to government data released last Friday, as a legion of newly minted middle class citizens tightened their belts and halted a credit-driven spending spree. The governments statistics bureau reported that gross domestic product dropped 0.6 per cent in the second quarter, in large part because of soft consumer spending. First-quarter results also were revised downward from 0.2 per cent growth to a 0.2 per cent drop, showing a two-quarter slide that most economists use to define a recession. Analysts said the economy also suffered because investors are holding off, waiting to see how the October presidential election changes the economic winds. Even the World Cup may have played a part because workers took many days off, contributing to limp industrial output. But the heart of the problem may be a crisis for the governments model of consumption-led growth. Of course Im spending a lot less! said Maria Sousa, a 25-year-old doing some window shopping but no buying at a mall in Rio de Janeiro. Im feeling less confident about my financial situation and Im thinking more about trying to save than spend. London-based Capital Economics wrote in a research note last Friday that it is consumption that has been the key driver of growth since the 2009 global financial crisis. But consumers are now struggling, in part because household balance sheets have become stretched following a decade-long credit boom. After blistering 7.5 per cent growth in 2010, Brazils economy has just limped along. The long, slow slide means there arent any regional shocks expected from the official drop into recession, but it still darkens the horizon for Brazils neighbours, many of whom send a large percentage of their exports into the nation. Argentina, whose economy is in recession and where citizens face inflation of 40 per cent, may be hurt the most. About one-fifth of Argentinas exports flow into Brazil, but the amount Brazilians buy is forecast to shrink. Brazil itself has been hurt by falling demand for its cars and big-ticket household items like refrigerators and washers in Argentina, one of the reasons Brazilian industrial output fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. Analysts said that to return to its days of fast growth, Brazil must undertake long-pending reforms to its tax system, labour laws and bureaucracy. Brazil remains a grindingly difficult place to do business. It ranked 116th on the World Banks most recent Ease of Doing Business Index, despite being the worlds seventh-largest economy. Brazils taxation regime was billed as the globes most complicated and burdensome, according to this years comparison of tax systems in 189 nations carried out by accounting company PwC, along with the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. That adds to bottlenecks at every turn when Brazil tries to capitalize on its potential, analysts say. The economic indicators are also the last thing President Dilma Rousseffs struggling re-election campaign needed. The slump gives more ammunition to Rousseffs rivals ahead of an October 5 presidential election vote, particularly for environmentalist Marina Silva, who is now leading polls and tapping into the widespread frustrations of many Brazilians, angst that fuelled last years massive anti-government protests.

Germany, the dynamo of the Euro zone, reported negative quarterly growth on the back of falling exports. The US investment bank, Morgan Stanley issued a report saying that the US was dangerously close to recession. All of this taking place against the background of the increasing riskiness of European sovereign bonds. Stock markets every- where are in retreat this month and ended this week in negative territory, again. Anxiety about the future is pervasive. Another substantial concern is the risk that the Euro zone crisis could escalate into another banking crisis. Banks and other financial intermediaries buy bonds as investments, or as part of their reserve requirements, in accordance with governing law. Deferment or compromises on government-backed Eurobonds would count as incidents of default which would lead to write-downs, distressed balance sheets and ultimately bank failures. This is one of the reasons why bank shares fell so dramatically this week and why short selling was banned last week, at least as a temporary measure, on European stock markets So the Minister can expect weaker world economic growth and in that context a weaker oil price (below US $100 per barrel) and a weaker gas price. The country's maintainable taxation revenue therefore will fall somewhere between TT$38 and $42 billion assuming that non-oil taxation revenues and Vat continue at their current rate and that there are no new taxes. In any event no new tax, including property tax, can cover the decline in tax revenues to be derived from natural gas, as it is revenues from gas, not oil, that drive the state's revenue. Before he considers any such adjustment, the minister must also look at incentives and/or devices that would spur the economy forward. In the last Business Guardian, several executives spoke out giving their take on what should be included in the budget. From the gas sector there was a call for a lowering in the natural gas feed stock pricing mechanism. There were calls for incentives to \\\"encourage research and development\\\", marketing assistance to facilitate international exports including meeting world standards to make T&T business more competitive internationally. And there was the usual talk about the need for measures to diversify the economy and kick start the construction sector. It is noteworthy that no executive interviewed said they were considering new investments. And the minister must also consider a tax regime to encourage additional offshore exploration. In short, measures in the short term that will reduce Government revenue. Any opportunity for budgetary adjustment must therefore lie on the expenditure side. But there are factors which inexorably expand the expenditure side. Salary increments occur naturally, increasing emoluments by three per cent per annum approximately. Inflation also affects the state's capacity to maintain its expenditures on goods and services as it pushes up the cost/price of everything and anything that it buys. New initiatives on the state's part also increase its expenses and modernisation costs money. And then there are the expectations of the electorate. Promises made during the election campaign usually require additional social expenditure encompassing several budget periods. This in part explains the current intransigence of the unions. On a more positive note, the fall in oil prices will reduce the impact of the \\\"gas\\\" (petrol) subsidy. But that by itself is not enough. In 2009, the previous administration reduced the subsidy by increasing the price of premium petrol at the pump, leaving the price of super and dieseline unchanged since they are significant inputs into the transportation system. The reduction in the subsidy, started in 2009, should be continued if only because it will lead to greater efficiency and more importantly, free resources for development. It is in this context that the decision to increase the age of imported used cars is not very prudent and places additional burdens on the state in the long run. Yet various ministers, rather than preparing the country for the inevitable, have indicated that the subsidy will remain. Other areas of social expenditure now need to be reviewed and calibrated to meet available resources. This requires both science and detailed work to ensure that the right balance is found. There will be the usual talk about efficiency and wastage but that will remain talk unless the matrix of benefits is harmonised. Whilst this work was started in 2009 as a result of the decline in energy prices, it did not go far enough and was forgotten in the aftermath of the 2010 elections. The imperatives of adjustment demand that whilst the impetus to home ownership should continue, the state cannot continue to subsidise both the cost of land development and the interest rate on the purchase of houses or land. And even if increasing food production is vital, a lending rate of three per cent at the Agricultural Development Bank cannot co-exist with 14 pages of fiscal incentives to farmers. Since the budget is unlikely to tackle all these issues, even if the speech does, we can expect to see another deficit, at least on paper. There was a real deficit in 2009, a paper deficit in 2010 (the final outturn was actually in surplus if one considers that the deficit was actually the result of a \\\"saving\\\", a transfer to the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund which Mr Dookeran initially said did not occur) and the final figure for 2011 is as yet unknown. At June 30, the Government was in surplus by $1.3 billion notwithstanding the projection of an $8 billion-plus deficit when the supplemental budget of June 2011 is taken into account. It is highly unlikely that a deficit of this size will occur unless the funds expended on the Clico \\\"bailout\\\" are brought to account which it will not for technical reasons ($5 billion to Clico, $1.9 billion in respect of Clico Investment Bank, $400 million to British American and a still unclear figure in respect of those policyholders who are due $75,000 or less). There still remains a substantial payment to come. The fiscal space is even more limited in 2012 than it was in 2011 and the spotlight is on Minister Dookeran. If 2010-11 is any guide to the future, it matters more what action he takes, than what he says.

The Department of Management Studies at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, Barbados recently concluded a survey of consumer sentiment across Caricom. Results indicated that consumers in a few countries were not as affected by natural disasters, rising inflation and the global economic meltdown. Other buyers in different Caricom territories believed that economic conditions are worse than they were a year ago. Following are the full results and analysis of the more than 6,000 responses received in the Caribbean-wide survey: The Department of Management Studies at UWI Cave Hill presents the first edition of its quarterly survey of consumer sentiment across Caricom. The Consumer sentiment indices we present measure consumers' perceptions and expectations of their personal financial situation, business conditions, economic conditions, and buying conditions. The indices are quantitatively derived scores with an anchor of 100. The indices can range from 0 (very pessimistic/negative outlook) to 200 (very optimistic/positive outlook), with 100 representing neutrality. Our indices are calculated using the same methodology as the widely reported University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index in the USA. Participants and Sampling Method Surveys of consumers were administrated by trained research assistants in Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and the OECS territories of Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts & Nevis, St Lucia and St Vincent & the Grenadines. A total of 6,157 responses were collected across ten countries. A sample of 500 consumers is used to construct the indices in the USA, UK and Canada and we require a minimum response rate of 500 persons per country for that country to be included in the survey. Consumer Sentiment Index: At the end of the first quarter of 2011, the Caricom Consumer Sentiment Index stood at 68. The fact that the index value is less than 100 suggests that a majority of consumers are generally pessimistic about their personal financial situation and general business and economic conditions. The pessimism in Caricom is shared by our major trading partners, in that at the end of March 2011 the index stood at 87.3 in Canada, 67.5 in the USA and 38 in the UK. Across Caricom, the Consumer Sentiment Index scores range from a high of 85 in Guyana to a low of 53 in St Lucia. The results suggest that consumers in Guyana, St Vincent & the Grenadines and Grenada are among the more optimistic or less pessimistic, St Lucians, Kittians & Nevisians, Jamaicans and Antiguans are among the more pessimistic, while consumers in Barbados, Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago are around the Caricom average. Consumer Expectations Index: The Consumer Expectations Index stood at 67. The fact that the index value is less than 100 suggests that a majority of persons across Caricom expect their personal financial situation, general business and economic conditions to get worse over the next year. The Caricom outlook is a bit more optimistic than in the USA (57.9) and the UK (50). Across Caricom, the Consumer Expectations Index scores range from a high of 81 in Guyana to a low of 47 in Jamaica. Consumers in Guyana and St Vincent & the Grenadines have the most positive outlooks, consumers in Jamaica, St Lucia, St Kitts & Nevis and Antigua & Barbuda have the most negative outlooks, while consumers in Barbados, Grenada, Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago are around the Caricom average. Current Economic Conditions Index: The Current Economic Conditions Index stood at 70. The fact that the index value is less than 100 indicates that a majority of persons in Caricom think economic conditions are worse than they were a year ago. The scores range from a high of 91 in Guyana to a low of 47 in St. Kitts and Nevis. Across Caricom, consumers in Guyana, Grenada and St Vincent & The Grenadines give the highest ratings to current economic conditions, consumers in St Kitts& Nevis, Antigua & Barbuda and St Lucia give the lowest ratings to current economic conditions, while consumers in Dominica, Trinidad & Tobago, Jamaica and Barbados are around the Caricom average. Current Personal Financial Situation: The Current Personal Financial Situation (compared to one year ago) Index stood at 88. This suggests that a majority of consumers' personal financial situation has remained the same or gotten worse over the last year. The index scores range from a high of 112 in Guyana to a low of 50 in St Kitts and Nevis. The results suggest that over the last year the personal financial situation of a majority of persons in Guyana and St Lucia has remained the same or gotten better and things have been pretty even in St Vincent & The Grenadines and Grenada. On the other hand, a majority of persons in Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica and Barbados have seen their personal financial situation remain the same or worsen, while a sizeable majority of persons in St Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Jamaica have seen their personal financial situation remain the same or worsen. Expected Personal Financial Situation: The Expected Personal Financial Situation (next 12 months) Index stood at 103, indicating that a majority of consumers expect their personal financial situation to stay the same or get better over the next twelve months. Consumers in Guyana and St Vincent & The Grenadines are the most optimistic about their personal financial prospects over the next twelve months and a majority of Barbadians, St Lucians, and Dominicans expect their personal financial situation to remain the same or get better over the next 12 months. However, a majority of consumers in St Kitts and Nevis, Antigua & Barbuda, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada expect their personal financial situations to remain the same or worsen over the next 12 months. Current Buying Conditions In The Country: The Current Buying Conditions Index stood at 91 indicating that a majority of consumers across Caricom thought it was a bad time to undertake major purchases. The scores ranged from a high of 126 in Grenada to a low of 44 in St Lucia. The results suggest that a majority of consumers in Grenada, Guyana and St Vincent & The Grenadines thought it was a good time to undertake major purchases, while a majority of consumers in Jamaica, Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago, St Kitts & Nevis, Barbados, Antigua & Barbuda and especially St Lucia thought it was a bad time to undertake major personal expenditures. Government Economic Policy Rating: Respondents were also asked to rate the current economic policies of their government. As to the economic policies of the government would you say the government is doing a good job, only fair, or a poor job On average only 14 per cent of consumers thought their government was doing a good job in terms of economic policies. Respondents in St Vincent & the Grenadines, Barbados and Grenada gave the highest marks to current government economic policies in that a majority of respondents rated government's economic policy as good or only fair. Jamaican respondents gave the lowest grade on government economic policies, and over fifty percent of respondents in St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago thought government's economic policies were poor. Conclusion In general, consumers in Guyana and St. Vincent & the Grenadines are the most optimistic in Caricom, while consumers in Antigua & Barbuda, St Kitts & Nevis, St Lucia and Jamaica are the most pessimistic. We attribute this to the fact that Guyana and St Vincent & the Grenadines are among the least tourism and international financial services dependent economies in Caricom. Hence, consumers in those countries may have suffered less from the impacts of the global economic recession and the ensuing slow recovery. On the other hand, Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts & Nevis along with being heavily tourism dependent may have been disproportionately impacted by the Stanford debacle, while St Lucia has had the additional impact of Hurricane Tomas. We would like to thank the citizens across Caricom for taking the time to complete our questionnaires as we look forward to your continued cooperation as we try to foster a Caricom Single Market and Economy.

A new report from ACCA Accountants for small business says that the SME finance function plays a critical role at different stages of an SMEs growth in attracting investment and helping them emerge from the shadows. ACCA says that SMEs need to make themselves ready and in shape to be able to receive finance and that the burden should not be solely on the lender or investor. Rosana Mirkovic, ACCA Head of SME Policy, said: There is considerable evidence which shows growth is much stronger amongst SMEs with a comprehensive finance function backing them up. The role of the accountant in an SME setting goes well beyond the basics of bookkeeping. Their role is vital at different stages of an SMEs development. Credit providers, supply chain partners and other stakeholders need a wealth of information form the finance team of an SME. For some investors the information they require changes after investment to focus on other aspects of the business, such as agreed milestones. Finance professionals are central to providing that insight into the business at all stages. Day to day financial management is the key to accessing finance. By the time the owner/manager decides to apply for any kind of funding, their chances of getting it are mostly locked in by the way theyve run their business to date. Independent research confirms that a well-run finance function staffed with appropriately trained people makes SMEs more creditworthy and investment-ready, and is a cause, not a consequence of growth. Despite that fact, most SMEs dont take advice before applying for loans; most have no trained staff in charge of their finances; and most dont produce regular management reports. While focus has largely been on who wont lend to SMEs, small businesses have a part to play in making themselves finance-ready. ACCA points to BDRC SME Finance Monitor statistics which show that in the UK, for example, 17.4 per cent of SMEs with regular management reporting, a formal written business plan and financially trained staff grew more than 30 per cent and ten per cent of those companies had a minimum risk rating. Just 7.5 per cent of SMEs without that financial expertise and support grew 30 per cent and only 2.5 per cent had a minimum risk rating. Mirkovic added: Our research, and that of others highlighted in our report, points in the same direction the role of finance professionals is widening and taking on a more business-focused nature, which is of particular importance for SMEs. From their infancy to their eventual growth into something larger and beyond, the role of their finance function changes and adapts to suit the needs of the business. The accountants who help a new start-up get off the ground will play a very different, but equally critical role when that business is in full, sustainable growth mode. It is for this reason that ACCA trains its members to be skilled in a broad range of abilities to make them complete finance professionals. Of course, we would always highlight the benefit ACCA accountants bring to any business, but the figures point to a more sure-footing for SMEs who have a rounded finance function behind them. There is clearly a significant difference between the SMEs embracing a comprehensive finance function and those who are less committed to being financially robust in their operations, even after accounting for influences such as business size, age or sector. High-growth firms are most likely to reach their maximum growth rate just three years from registration*, which means that at such an important period of change, having a finance professional on board that can support the business from start to high growth and beyond is clearly important. ACCA says that the SMEs have emerged as a key sector for the global economy. SMEs account for half of the worlds private sector output and nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of jobs worldwide, as well as approximately one-third of all developed-country exports. ACCA also reveals that the SME sector is a major employer of finance professionals in its own right. Although only about 13 per cent of ACCA members careers start in SMEs, 45 per cent of members, including 54 per cent of CFOs, have at some point in their lives worked for an SME. A new, free guide for small businesses as well as other useful support initiatives have been launched by ACCA aimed at helping SMEs with their finance operations, covering a range of issues, including hiring and training financial staff, outsourcing finance functions, software and systems advice as well as planning for future growth. Other useful support and guidance is also to be made available.

One consequence of the People's Partnership slowness in getting a move on is that problems and issues, once thought manageable by new hands, become only knottier. By today protests by the Public Services Association (PSA) are set to reach a new high, boosted by at least the moral support of 13 trade unions. Again, no movement has been shown on the Government side from the infamous one per cent offered by the Chief Personnel Officer. Yet another day of big marches and idle work places is likely to communicate the degree to which the Government has lost the initiative. Shows of militancy in the streets have emboldened PSA president Watson Duke. He was yesterday telegraphing rejection of any new CPO pay rise offer in less than \\\"double digits,\\\" even though the government has warned of a ballooning deficit if PSA-demanded pay increases are implemented.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Winston Dookeran appeared serenely to wait for the PSA campaign to run out of steam. \\\"Negotiations are underway,\\\" he said on Sunday. \\\"There is a process and hopefully rationality will prevail.\\\" The PSA, its labour allies, and the rest of T&T's business, are unlikely to adjust expectations and responses to the pace at which the People's Partnership administration appears willing and able to move. Thedelay in making State board appointments stands as the definitive, single illustration of an administration engine inexplicably stalling before it starts. Economy watchers over the last week have struck notes of frustration and disappointment. \\\"It seems as though the economy has come to a standstill, even though it has managed to pull itself out of economic recession\\\" FCB analyst Matthew George observed in the Business Express. \\\"A self-inflicted recession\\\" is how UWI economist Gregory McGuire summarised present economic conditions. \\\"When the Government's inaction stymies the activity of the State enterprises and statutory authorities, the result is an overall slowdown of economic activity,\\\" he wrote. Whether the economy is \\\"stagnant\\\" or \\\"in recession\\\", fingers of blame are pointing at the lack of active government being shown by the Persad-Bissessar administration over a range of fronts. If Government spendingestimated at 33 per cent of gross domestic productis needed to recharge the economy, the absence of enough such spending must result in job losses, dampened consumer behaviour, and flat business performance, further depressed by a slowdown of investment. The thunder of labour protests, then, is likely to be echoed in other sectors. Patience is running out for an administration which appears to have blocked its ears against the cries of widening frustration and the sounds of an economy grinding to a halt.

The International Monetary Fund points out that regional economies continued to falter, posting marginal gains in 2010. The first two quarters of this year have not been much better for many of them, even though the IMF said last month that overall, the Caribbean was beginning to turn the corner slowly after a \\\"long and deep recession\\\" and the prolonged effects of a global financial meltdown. In its latest Regional Economic Outlook released in May, the Washington, DC-based IMF said high public debt levels and weak external demand have held back growth in the region for the past two years. The IMF said tourism was improving gradually, with tourist arrivals improving in The Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and the Dominican Republic faster than eastern Caribbean territories. But it also noted that rising commodity prices also presented a clear downside risk to most Caribbean islands, with the exception of oil and gas rich Trinidad and Tobago which stands to benefit from higher oil export prices. The region's financial system remains vulnerable to shocks from cross-border financial conglomerate transactions, like the collapse of CL Financial and its subsidiary, insurance giant CLICO. As Central Bank Governor Ewart Williams pointed out during the business and finance seminar reception at the University of the West Indies last Wednesday, \\\"The Caribbean economies are still digging themselves out of the global crisis of 2008 and unfortunately the recovery of the region is lagging behind that of other developing countries.\\\" \\\"Countries in the region have been growing at an average rate of two per cent per year while small island states have been growing at an average rate of 3.6 per cent per year, roughly the average for the world economy,\\\" he said, noting that if the major economic players sought to reverse this trend, they will have to address their long-term viability. Since most Caribbean country economies are small, fragile and energy dependent, it is critical now to find ways of divesting to protect themselves against future downturns. It may also be a good lesson for Trinidad and Tobago to keep in mind.

True, Trinidad and Tobago is far from being any economic basket case. Indeed, the Central Bank was earlier this month projecting growth in real gross domestic product of one to two per cent. This economy has been in recovery mode following the sharp decline from 2008-2009. It is in the pace of picking itself up and taking off, however, that the T&T economy has recorded a disappointing performance. Inevitably, fingers are pointing at the People's Partnership administration into whose hands the economic levers were placed one year ago. Finance Minister Winston Dookeran in mid-May praised his own defensive policy posture in protecting the economy through restraining expenditure, citing his braking manoeuvres in the Clico investor pay-outs and in the public sector wage increase offers. But Mr Dookeran has also acknowledged the State's role in priming the pump and stimulating economic activity. As the Central Bank has noted, however, the expected fiscal stimulus from Government spending on capital projects simply did not occur over the six months since the September 2010 Dookeran Budget. It was in November that, with Transport Minister Jack Warner and National Infrastructure Development Company head Carson Charles, the Finance Minister had talked up the economic stimulation and job-creation potential of the Point Fortin Highway. In January, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar attended the sod-turning ceremony. But for that $7 billion project, so far only the most preliminary start-up signs are visible. Mr Warner had even promised highway construction, with a selected Brazilian contractor, would start in February. It turns out that the loan funding for the project is far from ready for drawdown. The spin-off effects of that unreadiness are being felt across the economy, as business stagnates, the banks are brimming with funds that companies see no need to borrow, and confidence evaporates. The Point Fortin highway project symbolises the larger failure of the State to kick-start public sector investment projects. Nor is that the only economic sin of omission attributed to the State. Business organisation leaders last week complained to the Business Express about intolerable delays in VAT refunds that complicate their financial arrangements. Meanwhile, the state also owes some $1 billion to contractors and is offering only a tortoise-paced process for rectifying such painful shortfalls in business receivables.

The T&T International Finance Centre tower thrusts skyward, proclaiming forward-thinking hopes and aspirations, dating from the last Manning administration, toward the achievement and maintenance of vital economic returns. Such returns must be suitably differentiated against those deriving from oil and natural gas. It's in this regard that an advertorial published last week by the T&T IFC resonates with special relevance. For the focus is on diversifying the T&T economy by means of \\u201cestablishing a robust financial services sector\\u201d. It is heartening, in these times when energy export income, investment and employment describe a steadily downward trend to recognise and uphold the existence of an organisation whose mission boldly aims \\u201cto make T&T the premier location in the western hemisphere for financial services\\u201d. The advertorial, taking in stride the dread pattern of T&T economic downturn and the prospects of a dark cloud indefinitely hovering, actually asserts the possibility of a \\u201csilver lining\\u201d. Official policy, as notably articulated last December 29 by Prime Minister Keith Rowley, appears to encourage little hope for near-term advances in economic diversification. Initiatives, such as those by the IFC, aimed at \\u201cexpansion of the nation's financial sector\\u201d, enjoy at best a low-key emphasis. Tourism, agriculture, maritime services are among sectors routinely suggested, invariably in a vaguely futuristic sense, as promising for the T&T economy. It is for the IFC now to ring a bell and call attention not just to the possibilities in the field of international finance, but also to an achievement it claims in the listing of T&T among nations leading in \\u201cfinancial attractiveness, people skills and availability, and business environment\\u201d. So defined, such T&T attributes are all too rarely promoted to the end of raising national self-esteem and advancing this country's claims as a location or destination for investment. Little daunted by apparently widespread pessimism about T&T's prospects outside the energy sector, the IFC highlights positives that include low infrastructure costs, high literacy, strong telecommunications infrastructure, tax incentives In addition, the IFC cites assets \\u201cnearshore location to Canada and the US\\u201d. At a time when shortfalls even in Carnival production and attendant economic activity work a disturbing if not a depressing effect, T&T is responsibly encouraged to see itself as a place inviting not just to energy investors but also to major players in international finance. The IFC's is thus a good-news story, worthy of sober celebration. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

GECS, the largest regular economic survey of accountants in the world, gauges the views of ACCA and IMA finance professionals globally, using the hands-on experiences of accountants in industry and practice to provide a truly global perspective of the economic recovery. The first GECS edition for 2014 saw global business confidence nearly cross over into positive territory for the first time in five years. But in the Caribbean, GECS Q1 shows that both business confidence and economic sentiment deteriorated in early 2014. Forty three per cent of respondents were optimistic about the state of their national economies, down from 45 per cent in late 2013. Over half (53 per cent) were pessimistic, up from 49 per cent previously. Only 14 per cent of respondents reported rising confidence in the prospects of their own organisations, down from 34 per cent in late 2013, while 39 per cent reported a loss of confidence, down from 48 per cent previously, the ACCA said in a statement last week. Emmanouil Schizas, ACCAs senior economic analyst, said: The shift in confidence is strongly supported by deteriorating fundamentals. Business opportunities in the region fell sharply for a second consecutive quarter, back to levels last seen in the third quarter of 2012. Investment opportunities also fell, and are now scarcer than at any time during the last three years. Cashflow and demand conditions tightened, although they remain close to average levels for 2013. Most importantly, a year-long trend towards increasing price and exchange rate stability was broken in early 2014, and the tentative recovery in access to growth capital was interrupted. As a result capacity building by businesses fell for a second consecutive quarter, to the lowest levels observed in the last three years. Brenda Lee Tang, head of ACCA Caribbean, commented: The role of the profession in supporting economic growth is one ACCA is passionate about, so this 21st edition of GECS comes with some interesting findings about accountants perceptions regarding business confidence and economic recovery. In this edition, it is worth noting that the Caribbean is not the only region to question the recovery - respondents in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific and Africa have all slowly dropped out of the global recovery consensus over the least six months. Global findings Thirty per cent of respondents around the world were now more confident about the prospects of their organisations than they had been three months earlier, a figure unchanged since late 2013. On the other hand, 31 per cent reported a loss of confidence, down from 34 per cent in late 2013. Additionally, more than half of the global GECS sample (58 per cent, up from 55 per cent in late 2013) were optimistic about the state of their national economies, reporting that recovery was underway or about to begin. The pessimists only made up 38 per cent of the sample, down from 42 per cent in the previous quarter. However, a closer look revealed a worrying picture for the global economic recovery. Schizas added: Despite the best business confidence readings since the GECS began in 2009, ACCA and IMAs analysis of the influence of fundamentals on business confidence suggests that the economic recovery is flawed and has now become much more fragile. Since early 2013, global business confidence has become increasingly dependent on price and exchange rate stability. This trend is a sign of building financial turbulence, and has accelerated dramatically in early 2014. Financial stability is now a more significant contributor to business confidence than cash-flow and demand...

Imam Ali acknowledged that his followers comprised criminals and former prisoners who sought refuge in Islam. The Express reported on how the Jamaat was able to set up a base in Carapo by squatting on State lands, was being funded through the Ministry of Sport's Life Sport Programme and the collusory/antagonistic relationship between the group and the police. In Part 4, the Sunday Express focuses on the funding from Life Sport and the relationship between the Carapo Muslims and crime, gangs and the Government. Rajaee Ali, through the Ministry of Sport's LifeSport programme is getting about $1.5 million a month in profit and has raked in about $18 million in the last year, National Security Minister Gary Griffith has alleged. Ali, the son of Jamaat-Al Muslimeen's Imam Hassan Ali, is coordinator of the Carapo arm of the Life Sport programme. Minister Gary Griffith alleged that the younger Ali is using ghost names in the programme. There are supposed to be 60 participants in one area, and overall, the programme operates in 33 areas. A stipend of $1,500 is paid a month for every participant enrolled in the programme. Griffith said in each area, 30 of the 60 participants are ghosts. Ali, Griffith alleged, is pocketing the stipend being paid on over half of the participants in the overall programme with the complicity of the Ministry of Sport. \\\"What they do is cut it by half-the other half are ghosts. Each person is supposed to be paid $1,500 a month, so you're looking at $1,500 by 30 by 33. So Ali and company get $1.5 million in net profit per month,\\\" he alleged in an interview with the Sunday Express on Friday. The LifeSport Programme is one way in which the Jamaat has been funded through the government in the past two years. The LifeSport Programme, which started at $6.6 million in 2012, increased to $29 million in 2013 and by 2014, the programme increased in cost by $84.4 million to $113,502,273. It was an initiative of the Ministry of Sport's permanent secretary Ashwin Creed. Its intent was to introduce sport and life skills to boys between 16-25 years old to curb crime in high-risk areas. Griffith said the sum Ali is able to pocket from the programme is exclusive of management fees and catering fees which are part of the Ministry of Sport's expenses in the programme.. \\\"We actually found out that the LifeSport fund was being used as a fuel stop off point for further activity,\\\" he said. But intelligence is not evidence, as Ali still conducts prayers at the Carapo mosque. Griffith observed that in the United States, there are hundreds of people on a terrorist watch list. \\\"What you don't do is allow them to paint the Pentagon. You don't give them a contract to paint the White House,\\\" he said. Sunday Express: \\\"The Jamaat had a contract to paint buildings\\\" Gary Griffith: \\\"Spanish (an alleged gang leader) was actually putting in CCTV cameras in the Duncan Street Police Station. And then people will try and pretend they didn't know.\\\" The Sunday Express understands that Cabinet, and certainly the National Security Council, were aware of this growing threat over the past two years. Rajaee Ali, \\\"the Don\\\" Griffith identified Ali as \\\"the one who has been (allegedly named) in most of the murders in Arouca and Maloney, D'Abadie and O'Meara and those areas.\\\" He has become the don, the godfather inside there,\\\" he said. In 2004, Ali was charged with the murder of Amadoo Huggins, when he was just 18. He has spent eight years in prison. In 2007, he was one of three prisoners who escaped from Golden Grove Prison in Arouca, but was eventually caught and sent back. He was released in 2011. Two weeks ago, following the murder of former independent senator and senior counsel Dana Seetahal, Ali was arrested for gang related activities. The National Security Minister was asked by the Sunday Express to explain just how profits allegedly made through the LifeSport Programme were used. \\\"The LifeSport Fund is one of the major things which has affected us,\\\" he said on the country's security apparatus to control crime. \\\"Most of the criminal activ ities, the gangs work on is the profit they get from these State contracts. So they use their profits. The funds they get, they use to pay their gang members, they pay police officers,\\\" he said. Asked how aware and complicit the Cabinet was to the fund financing criminals, Griffith said: \\\"In fairness to the government, they weren't aware till I brought it to their attention based on the intelligence I had.\\\" He did not want to disclose on the record exactly when the Cabinet was apprised of the LifeSport's other uses. Attempts to contact Ali by phone for comment have been unsucessful. Letter from Mr Hugh Grant As for how Ali became the coordinator, details were discovered in a memo from the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Sport dated June 12, 2013. \\\"In addition, with respect to the letters of engagement between each coordinator and the Ministry of Sport, we have observed that a Mr Hugh Grant executed the contracts for the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Sport for an on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The Ministry of Finance and the Economy wishes to remind you that the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Sport is the Ministry's Accounting Officer and is the appropriate officer for executing such documents. \\\"Further, with respect to the letter of engagement between Rajaee Ali and the Ministry of Sport for the provision of services as a community coordinator for the two month period commencing January 2, 2013, it should be noted that the letter bears the signature of Mr Rajaee Ali as both the Permanent Secretary and the Community Coordinator. Please clarify,\\\" the letter noted. \\\"Furthermore, it should be noted that whilst we are unable to approve the payment to coordinators until the contracts are executed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Sport, we have observed that there are inconsistencies in the certification of the coordinators invoices. The Ministry of Finance and the Economy is very concerned abour the inconsistencies in invoices submitted for payment, most notably in respect of the fact that new invoices are being generated in lieu of our request for the original invoices to be appropriately certified,\\\" the memo stated. Auditor General's report In the Auditor General's 2013 report, it noted several financial irregularities in the Ministry of Sport and in the LifeSport Programme: 1. Three invoices for equal amounts totaling $259,350 for catering of meals for the LifeSport Programme in three different areas-Marabella, Morvant and Bagatelle did not reflect any business address or telephone contact number for the supplier. 2. From a review of one month's payments under the LifeSport Programme, 59 participants who were seen to have been paid stipends totaling $88,500 for St Joseph, were also seen to have been paid $88,500 for Maloney. In addition, a further amount of $76,500 was paid to 51 participants for Maloney. Also, payments for six participants in the Maraval area were made to the same bank account. The report noted that analysis of the internal audit programme of work for the year revealed that high risk areas such as the LifeSport Programme were not included for review. Cutting the Funding On Friday, Minister of Works and Infrastructure Surujrattan Rambachan told Parliament: \\\"Mr Speaker, I want to say that this Government has never and is not in the habit, now or ever been in the habit, of funding criminal elements in Trinidad and Tobago. \\\"That will not happen under this Government. \\\"The Government will always strive to ensure that people who conduct themselves within the law will be the beneficiaries of that which the Government has to offer the country, in terms of its development,\\\" he added. But Griffith explained that the Ministry of Sport was recently forced to host a family day for about $8 million to pacify the participants because he tried to force the Cabinet to hold back approval on the LifeSport payment. \\\"That is why I am so, you want to use the word, obsessed with destroying these gangs. If I cut their financial supply, its going to stop them from being able involved in the corruption of the criminal justice system by buying off police officers, paying off anyone, being able to pay gang members. Crippling the financial pockets will enable the law enforcement agencies to now move in,\\\" he said. Griffith elaborated: \\\"If they have good finance, good capital, they are able to invest assist and distribute their funds, on how they were able to be so successful. If they have no finance, they can't run a business. \\\"Gang activity is a business. That is how they thrive on it. To run a business, you need capital. Where are they going to get that capital from\\\" Griffith said he became aware of these activities when he was the Prime Minister's National Security Adviser but became more \\\"vociferious\\\" when he became Minister. \\\"I had the authority to start putting, squeezing the system. I was able to come and point the fact that gangs have tried to infiltrate into state funding,\\\" he said. Asked whether the Government would take steps in an election year, given that Imam Ali had said the Jamaat voted for the People's Partnership, Griffith responded: \\\"If it is that this Government or any Government feels that they need to liaise with criminal elements to be get in Government, I don't want to be part of that Government. I don't think any citizen would want to be part of it. \\\"For too long, we keep hearing of these insurgents, these radical people who say that if they give us money and you find us, we will get them to vote. Apart from lack of ethics, it is tantamount to treason in a country. And if you're starting to buy votes, what you're actually doing is selling the soul of the country. \\\" If you sleep with Devil there is going to be a price to pay. When you come into Government, you're going to have to pay the price.\\\" Howai on Life Sport Finance Minister Larry Howai said he was concerned about whether the Life Sport programme was potentially funding criminals. \\\"As Minister of Finance and the Economy I assure you that I am concerned about these allegations as reported in your articles. Notwithstanding our resource limitations (monitoring 30 ministries and 75 state enterprises/statutory bodies.which is not really the remit of the Ministry...is not easy) the Ministry of F&E has in the past few months re-doubled its oversight efforts of all Ministries and in particular of this Programme. An audit was done of the Programme following the discrepancies which were identified and the findings of the Report were forwarded to the Minister and the Sport Company to ensure that the controls and supervision exercised by these bodies over the Programme could be tightened and improved and appropriate action taken where persons were guilty of any wrongdoing. \\\"As the letter from the PS referred to in the article this morning indicated, the Ministry of F&E exercises great care and where irregularities show up, these are referred to the relevant Ministry for action immediately. While the The Ministry of Finance and the Economy does not in general, do disbursements for the Ministries, it tries as far as it possibly can to ensure that the money spent is of benefit not only to the individual participants in a programme but to the country as a whole,\\\" he said.

The Chamber, guided by our Tobago Division, and in concert with the Tobago Hotel and Tourism Association, has been a key driver in proposing a debt restructuring plan, aimed at businesses which would be viable, save for experiencing cash flow difficulties due to the slowdown of activity in the tourism sector in Tobago. We believe that the effort by the government to address the Tobago economy at this critical juncture is long overdue. This plan was presented to central government, the Tobago House of Assembly and other key stakeholders at several meetings during 2010 and 2011. It was a culmination of approximately four years of dedicated work and determination to see it to fruition. We have always stressed, that the injection of the money into Tobago's cash-strapped businesses is paramount and urgent. Consequently, with this new development, steps must now be taken to accelerate the process, so that businesses can take advantage of the windows of opportunity which may open from the initiatives announced by the Prime Minister. The Chamber looks forward to continuing to work with central government, the Bankers Association and the THA in order to fulfill our mandate with regards to ensuring the economic survival and viability of Tobago businesses. The very survival of the Tobago economy rests with a well-functioning tourism industry, and we therefore welcome the other proposals for boosting tourism in Tobago. These include Tobago as a duty free economic zone for shopping, and construction of additional hotel rooms and first-class marinas. These initiatives certainly seem to have the potential for significant impact on the development and modernisation of the island's tourism product, as well as the creation of much-needed sustainable employment on the island We however recognise that these initiatives may require further research and consultation in order to gauge accurately the net economic benefits to be realised from the proposed projects. Recent statements by the THA's Finance Secretary demonstrate that the most desirable approach is to achieve full stakeholder collaboration and buy-in. This will certainly go a long way to ensuring the success of any project being contemplated. Some commitments must also be made regarding the time frame for implementation of the proposals. The Chamber reiterates its readiness to assist, in any way possible, to move these projects from discussion to realisation, once it has been reasonably demonstrated that the proposals are economically sound. Yet, we note with concern, that no fully developed, holistic economic plan for Tobago has been developed. The Chamber strongly believes that in order to reap the fruits of these - or any - initiatives, an overall economic development plan for the island must be developed based on careful research, stakeholder input and with goals and timelines clearly defined. This is imperative if we are to attract investors wishing to participate in our development drive. The arrival of the energy industry to Tobago is imminent with the announcement that Centrica Energy is in discussions with the Ministry of Energy over the commercialisation of gas off the north-east coast of Tobago. Since this could represent the largest investment in the island's history, it is expected that numerous business opportunities will in due course emanate from this activity. There is still some time before this is activated, and we hope that central government and the THA will collaborate in ensuring that residents of Tobago are sensitised, and offered the necessary technical and artisan training to equip them to take advantage of new business and employment opportunities. The Chamber will certainly play its part by continuing our collaboration with the THTA and similar business representative organisations in order to widen ownership and strengthen our lobby. We are positive that Tobago can continue to build on this renewed momentum for a prosperous economy. We reconfirm our commitment to be part of any process that will be to the benefit to the island's business sector and indeed, all Tobagonians.

Minister of Planning, Housing and the Environment Emily Gaynor Dick-Forde, who also spoke at the launch, acknowledged the growing importance of small and medium businesses to the economy during the period of economic downturn. Dick-Forde said the IIC programme, which is being funded by the Governments of Korea and Austria, can help strengthen the ability of local small and medium enterprises to continue to make an even greater contribution to the development of the local economy. She added that in Trinidad and Tobago small businesses are often defined as comprising six to 25 employees while medium 25 to 50 employees and of 2006 there were 1,924 small enterprises and 740 medium-sized enterprises operating in this country.

Speaking to the Express yesterday, economist Jwala Rambaran said the slowdown and its effects on the local economy could lead to more responsible handling of taxpayers' dollars this year. The economist, who was among many financial experts who critiqued both the level of Government expenditure last year and the use of the $70 oil price in the national budget, said the fallout of the global economic crisis leaves room for the powers that be to do \\\"a complete re-assessment of this country's economic status, and to re-examine the road down which the country is headed.\\\" Like Rambaran, Imtiaz Ali, head of the San Juan Business Association, said the slowdown has created the opportunity for the government to do more with less, instead of the other way around. The businessman said, \\\"When we have less money, we always exhibit more discipline, we tend to control it better.\\\" Karen de Montbrun, president of the Trinidad and Tobago Manufacturers Association, said it is obvious the Government has already started moving towards \\\"tightening its belts.\\\" She said she was pleased to see this country's administration leading by example. While Gregory Aboud, president of the Downtown Owners and Merchants Association, said both the media and politicians are making the economic situation out to be a \\\"crisis\\\" when it is only a slowdown. He said that the exaggerated descriptions of the country's present economic climate are doing more damage than good, as they are scaring both average citizens and potential investors and therefore hindering the public's confidence and slowing growth even further. He is fearful that all the talk of a local economic crisis could become a self-fulfilling prophecy which citizens create for themselves. While Rambaran agreed with Aboud to some extent, he said the reality is that while the country is not in crisis mode, it is high time that both the man on the street and the man in charge embrace the fact that everyone, everywhere could be facing a global recession which can last up to two years.

John's Former Antiguan finance minister Harold Lovell is supporting moves by the Antigua-based regional airline, LIAT, to reduce its staff and downsize its operations in the face of continued economic challenges. Last month Prime Minister Gaston Browne said he wanted to hold a meeting with the shareholder governments of the airline after it announced plans to send home at least 180 workers and shift some of its operations to Barbados. In a letter to St Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves, the Antigua and Barbuda prime minister is urging that the financially strapped airline take no further action until his administration discusses the matter. We understand that from time to time we will have to make changes, we understand that LIAT is in a very precarious position, at the end of the day our economy is also in a precarious position and I just want to get all the facts together, he said. But Lovell, speaking on Observer radio here, said that the airline has no choice but to review and downsize its operations. LIAT has to downsize, I mean, I know perhaps, its politically incorrect for me to say that. But the point is if you run a restaurant and you have 50 tables and you employ, for argument sake, one person per table, and then you have 20 tables you would not keep the 50 employees when you only have 20 tables. There has to be something which allows us to absorb those workers or to have a strategy thats going to deal with the excess capacity that you now have, he said, indicating that the government should examine other options to provide employment for the workers likely to be laid off. The former civil aviation minister said this could be done through creating business opportunities for complementary aviation services. If you incorporate a company, the business which would be the training of pilots, there is a market out there for that, because every airline that operates at the level of LIAT around the region they are using ATRs and this is an opportunity, Lovell said, noting that private investors and not the government should be involved in running the airline. LIAT is owned by the governments of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados Dominica and St Vincent and the Grenadines. The major shareholders have been appealing to other regional governments to invest in the airline that provides the main mode of transport between the islands. Lovell said Antigua and Barbuda cannot simply keep saying no to LIAT without putting forward a viable solution to its financial problems.

The United States narrowly averted a trillion-dollar debt default last Tuesday when President Barack Obama signed a bill raising the country's debt ceiling. But the debt deal might not be enough to maintain its coveted AAA debt rating, international credit rating agencies are saying. What may be more worrisome for Trinidad and Tobago, are the spillover effects likely to flow from a US economy on the brink of a downgrade. Fitch Ratings last week said the agreement to raise the debt ceiling and make spending cuts was an important first step but \\\"not the end of the process\\\". Moody's Investors Service assigned a negative outlook to US debt, but confirmed its AAA rating for now. A negative outlook means the rating agency could lower the rating in the next 12 to 18 months. Moody's said continued slow economic growth, higher interest rates could lead to a downgrade. Moody's also said weak fiscal discipline in the coming year could do the same. US debt has held the AAA rating since 1917. Fewer than 20 countries are currently rated AAA. Among them: the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and Singapore. Scotiabank managing director Richard Young believes there could be negative and positive impacts for Trinidad and Tobago. \\\"In a broad sense as a country, as has been said publicly, there must be some spillover. Remittances from the US could decline but on the positive side, if there is a downgrade, US supplies (like food) could be cheaper. But there would be a gestation period for this if the US economy gets impacted because of a lower rating,\\\" he told the Business Express. If the US is downgraded, prices could come down and Trinidad could reap the benefits. But there are also currency concerns. If the US dollar gets weaker, it will make other currencieslike the Canadian dollar-even stronger, Young suggested. Canadian dollars are selling at almost TT$7 for one now. The value in absolute terms of Trinidad and Tobago's Heritage and Stabilisation Fund could also be affected if the value of the US dollar dips. One could speculate that oil and gas revenues could come down too, if prices slide on the international market. \\\"As a country, we must be concerned because it is not just the United States, the whole world is in a tailspin, and we must be part of that,\\\" Young says. \\\"We must be prudent. But there may also be a golden opportunity for the country to re-engineer itself.\\\" While he commended Finance Minister Winston Dookeran's efforts to stabilise the economy, Young suggested that any downgrade in the US will have some effect on Trinidad and Tobago. Dookeran maintained last Thursday that Trinidad and Tobago's economy remains stable even though Standard and Poor's lowered this country's long-term local-currency sovereign credit rating to 'A/A-1' from 'A+/A-1'; and the same time affirmed the country with an 'A/A-1' foreign-currency ratings. He said in a statement this new development is based on methodology rather than a change in perception. He noted that the change will still leave the country with an 'A' Grade and in his views it reflects the stringent measures taken by the rating agency in the aftermath of challenges facing the US economy. \\\"Under the revised methodology, the gap between the local- and foreign-currency ratings on most sovereigns we rate worldwide is narrowing. This is because we believe that given the increasing globalisation of markets, governments are likely to have fewer incentives to differentiate between their local- and foreign-currency debt in the event of debt restructuring.\\\" It also added that, \\\"The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the government's cautious macroeconomic policies should keep its fiscal and external debt burdens steady, which includes the expectation of no further erosion of the balance sheet because of the resolution of CL Financial Group bankruptcy.\\\" TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

A host of sceptics were adamant from the start that Sir Allen Stanford's fanfared entry into West Indies cricket was too good-or too bad-to be true. His global financial empire might have turned over skillions annually but there appeared no business sense to his sudden heavy investment in a regional game restricted to small territories with small economies and small populations. Even in the long run, it surely could not earn a profit. Perhaps it was a message from accountants bold enough to deliver it that is one reason for his decision to \\\"review\\\" his involvement. It was similar advice that forced Kerry Packer to cut costs in his second season of World Series Cricket. There are clearly other grounds for Stanford's reasseement. He himself has cited as another the sponsorship clash with Digicel over his Super Stars' 20/20 for 20 million match against England that became the jewel in his crown. It led to an expensive, widely-publicised case in a London court, an embarrassment for which he squarely blames the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). It was an event he clearly expected to boost his global image and that of his companies. Instead, the British media ensured it was a public relations disaster with its disparagement of every aspect of it. There were many who could not accept his stated motives at face value. \\\"My love for cricket is as great as any West Indians' and it is certainly something that, when it is at the top, we all rise to the top with it, businesses included, and I have businesses in the Caribbean and we all float up with it,\\\" Stanford said prior to this year's regional 20/20 tournament. \\\"Plus it's a very emotional thing and when cricket falls into the trough as it has been, you want to try and do something about it. \\\"In essence, this was the impetus for my venture into the business of cricket in 2005, and it continues to be the driving force behind my heavy investment in the game in the Caribbean,\\\" he added. Michael Holding was one of those who first sparked Stanford's interest in cricket. He spent a brief time as one of the 'legends' on his board of directors before resigning. Ironically, he became one of his sharpest critics. The revered fast bowler of the great team under Clive Lloyd (who also severed links with Stanford early in the piece) acknowledged that the initial plan benefited West Indies cricket through grants to individual associations to develop the game and its infrastructure. But he claimed that changed with Stanford's deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for the US$20 million Super Series in Antigua and subsequent projects in England. \\\"He wants to promote himself and his companies, that's all,\\\" Holding told the London Daily Mail last August. \\\"If people can't see that then I can't help them, it's their problem.\\\" Whatever the arguments and the causes for Stanford's change of direction, there can be no doubt that he injected a new excitement to Caribbean cricket to counteract the constant bungling and incompetence of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the depressing results on the field. Even Chetram Singh, long-serving Guyana board chief and WICB director, acknowledged that Stanford cricket \\\"pulled a lot of people in to the game and a lot of territories benefited from the money to buy equipment and renovate their grounds and hire coaches and so on\\\". If he now pulls the plug on his Caribbean cricket operations, as opposed to his English venture-as seems likely with the disbanding of his board of legends and the closing of the office in Antigua-the 20/20 tournament will be missed most of all. Quite apart from the huge prize money earned by the winning teams and playersTrinidad and Tobago pocketed US$1.5 million in the two years, Guyana US$1 million, Jamaica US$500,000it gave the anonymous weekend club cricketers from previously ignored smaller islands their moment in the television spotlight and their impoverished associations finances never forthcoming from the regional board. Characters like Dane Weston from US Virgin Islands who became a star with his stares, hip-wiggling wicket celebrations and \\\"war\\\" talk, like Lionel Ritchie, the batsman from St Maarten with the showbiz name, like construction worker Maxford Pipe from the BVI. It brought Lionel Baker and Andre Fletcher to wider public attention, both moving into the West Indies team, Baker as Montserrat's first Test player. The accepted modern maxim is that sport is a business and, like any other business, is guided by the bottom line. It led Stanford to sell his Caribbean Star and Caribbean Sun airlines and it now appears as if his venture into West Indies cricket will endure the same fate.

INSPECTION: Minister of Sport Anil Roberts, third from left, and other officials on a walkabout at Larry Gomes Stadium in Malabar, Arima on Tuesday. The stadium is one of four facilities having upgrades done to its track and football field. When it comes to projections on the Trinidad and Tobago economy, the International Monetary Fund's been \\\"dead wrong for the last three years\\\". That's the \\\"pessimistic yet realistic\\\" view of economist Dr Dhanayshar Mahabir in response to the IMF's optimism that the twin-island economy \\\"is turning the corner\\\" and is projected to grow by 1.7 per cent in 2012. \\\"The Fund has been very clever in their use of language. They did not show where the growth was going to come from. There's nothing by way of objective leading indicators. There's no hard data,\\\" Mahabir told the Business Express last Friday. Despite burgeoning new car sales often associated with prosperity, the country has been in recession since 2008, he said. The IMF's positive outlook, after years of economic stagnation, was widely quoted by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar during political rallies in the lead-up to a no-confidence motion brought against her by Opposition Leader Dr Keith Rowley last week. Economic recovery is a victory the People's Partnership is hoping to claim after two years in office. Stymied by an inheritance with included outstanding debts to contractors, wage negotiations with unions and a resolution to the CLICO issue, Finance Minister Winston Dookeran could not see the blue skies he hoped for in 2011. With an expensive budget- over $50 billion which capitalises on a plan first set forward in 2011 to turn the economy around, the Government is hopeful that 2012 will be that year. With wage negotiations being gradually concluded, money being paid to contractors as well as CLICO policyholders, coupled with investments in the energy sector and from Government's overseas marketing to India and Brazil, the Persad-Bissessar administration is hoping the liquidity injection will positively impact the economy. But with an ironing out of some issues, says Mahabir, comes new challenges higher salaries for Petrotrin workers and the news that Trinidad Cement Ltd (TCL) will import cement to meet quotas. \\\"Ancel Roget has shown that there's nothing sacrosanct about a five per cent wage cap and Petrotrin settled to minimise pain to the country. And while cement is not critical as gasoline, it is important for construction which is the sector needed to pull the economy out of the rut,\\\" he reasoned. As far as Mahabir's concerned, T&T's economy is on a tightrope. And in that scenario, there'll be no economic growth for 2012, or for the next six years. \\\"We've had three years of decline. Though it's not been steep, it is slipping backwards. And 2012 does not appear to be a year of progress,\\\" he said during a telephone interview. He accused the Central Bank of practising loose monetary policy and the Government of loose fiscal policy. \\\"Fiscal policy does not hold much optimism for economic revival. We have exhausted our monetary and fiscal ammunition and the private sector has not responded. The private sector usually responds when expected profitability improves,\\\" he stated. Since 2008, Mahabir has been wary of economic projections and analysis of the economy. Quite simply, he doesn't believe his contemporaries understand the economy the way he does. And while he begs forgiveness for his arrogance, he explained that analysis usually relies on the superficial be it the healthy state of foreign reserves or the low level of foreign debt. \\\"In 2008, the Government was of the view that you had to spend your way out of a decline. That was a fundamental misunderstanding of what ailed T&T,\\\" he explained. During the period 2004-2008, significant investments were made by the Government and the private sector. He characterised this period as \\\"years of heavy spending by all actors of the economy\\\". Post 2008 though, the private sector withdrew from spending evidenced by the level of investments made in buildings, plants and equipment, he said. He observed that with manufacturing plants operating at two-thirds their capacity, there was simply not enough private sector activity. \\\"When the Fund gave projections, I did not see the source of growth,\\\" he said. For instance, Mahabir believes the CLICO money repaid to policyholders will be banked and not immediately re-invested, contributing to the liquidity crisis in the country. \\\"CLICO money will do nothing to stimulate the economy. The Government has gotten it wrong and they are misleading the country. People would not want to spend their funds immediately. They would keep it to spend for the rest of their lives or over a range of activity over a period of time. The fund would be parked up in the bank,\\\" he explained. Can the government policy achieve 1.7 per cent growth For that to happen, says Mahabir, the leading indicators would vary, such as: the amount of building permits approved by Town and Country Planning for execution (indicative of housing and construction activity), orders by manufacturers for new plants and equipment, the number of new office buildings the business class plans to construct and reduction in inventories of finished goods by manufacturers. \\\"In a boom period, sometimes you have to wait for two weeks to get building blocks. So how long you take to fill the order of a customer is also indicative of the state of the economy because there's a great demand for building blocks,\\\" he said. So what can the Government do to get out of this quagmire For Mahabir, that answer lies with Foreign Direct Investment a return on the government's trip to India, a return on big investments like Atlantic (which impacts on several sectors of the economy). \\\"Public policy has to be figured. Dookeran cannot afford any more deficits and the Central Bank cannot afford any more looseness,\\\" he said.

GECS, the largest quarterly economic survey of accountants in the world, gauges the views of ACCA and IMA finance professionals working at the coal face of businesses. The Q2 2013 edition showed that just 24 per cent of respondents in the Caribbean reported increased confidence in the prospects of their organisations - up marginally from 23 per cent in the first quarter of 2013; while 45 per cent reported a loss of confidence, up 14 per cent from the first quarter of the year. On a global scale, the GECS found that both business confidence and optimism about the economy continued to rise during the second quarter of the year. Nearly half of the GECS sample 47 per cent felt that the state of the economy was improving or about to do so, up from 43 per cent in early 2013, while just under 50 per cent were pessimistic, predicting deterioration or stagnation, down from 54 per cent in the first quarter. This is the highest level of optimism about the national and global economies in two years, and the strongest year-on-year improvement in three years. The survey showed there was improved availability of growth capital on a global scale in the second quarter of 2013, which was driving confidence upwards. Emmanouil Schizas, ACCA senior economic analyst and editor of the GECS, said: While there has been a drop in the Caribbeans confidence levels, across the globe the survey shows the highest level of optimism about the national and global economies in two years, and the strongest year-on-year improvement in three years. Business confidence has inched upwards, following an overly-bullish first quarter, and is now in line with the fundamentals of the business environment. What is encouraging is that the marginal improvement in global business dynamism in early 2013 has now accelerated across all measures of investment, orders and employment. Employment in particular is recovering quickly and is now stronger than at any point in the last two years. Brenda Lee Tang, head of ACCA Caribbean, added: Although access to growth capital in the Caribbean improved in the second quarter of 2013 and appears to be on a generally upward trend, the improved trading environment isnt leading directly to a rise in investment in the region. Less demand and tightening cash-flow conditions, added to the rise in inflation may be making Caribbean businesses cautious about making long-term commitments. Despite that caution, the Caribbeans finance professionals are reporting that businesses are hopeful about the wider economic recovery, with 52 per cent optimistic about seeing economic conditions improve, up from 45 per cent earlier in the year, which may bode well looking to the rest of the year. Across the world, fewer respondents reported falling revenues and declining orders. There has been little change in the share of respondents worried about customers or suppliers failing, despite the tightening of cash-flow conditions. The second quarter also saw businesses reporting more investment and business opportunities being available particularly through investment in new markets, niche offerings, and high quality standards.

Data obtained by the Express from the Ministry of Legal Affairs shows that the registration of new businesses has increased by an average of 10 per cent since the global financial meltdown in 2008, while company registration has increased by more than 20 per cent. \\\"Whether they are actually successful is something else,\\\" said local economist Indira Sagewan-Ali during a telephone interview last week. Nevertheless, she said \\\"entrepreneurs are integral to all capitalist economies, therefore vital to Trinidad and Tobago\\\". \\\"They are the drivers of the engine of growth-the private investing sector. Private sector investment generates employment and provides revenue to the government which is used to provide basic utilities and social services,\\\" she said. \\\"From an economic growth perspective\\\", Sagewan-Ali said \\\"increased emergence of small and micro enterprises in a crisis period is important for domestic stability\\\". She added, however, that necessity \\\"is the mother of all invention\\\". Something 23-year-old Sean Hanuman has fully embraced. \\\"I saw an opening for the maintenance industry because there are not a lot of companies that do drain cleaning and tank cleaning here in Trinidad, and honestly, the ones that are around, are highly overpriced,\\\" he said. The managing director of TopLine Maintenance, Hanuman recently started his business out of his apartment in Valsayn after coming to terms with rumours of restructuring at his old job. \\\"Up until January 5, I worked at Kimberly Clarke (Trinidad) Ltd for three years as a quality control technician\\\". \\\"Before that, the company was called Misons Industries, and I was there for two years doing the same thing so making it five years that I worked for that company,\\\" he said. Hanuman said he scraped up his savings and borrowed from his family to start TopLine Maintenance and strongly believes that if he keeps his focus \\\"I am going to give Century 21 a run for their money at some point down the line\\\". \\\"It was not life long, it was something that just happened, but I know it's going to work,\\\" he said. Hanuman admits that maintenance cleaning is a dirty business; after all, he cleans everything from clogged toilets to water wells. \\\"Somebody has to do it and I don't mind being that person being me\\\". Recalling how at one point in time he had to call out maintenance personnel, Hanuman said the people charged him $1,500 an hour to unclog a drain. \\\"I thought that was a lot of money, so I decided I could go lower than that, much lower and still make,\\\" he said. For a young person, however, starting a new business can be a scary endeavour says Sandrine Rattan, manager, Corporate Communications at the National Entrepreneurship Development Company Limited (Nedco). Which is why she said \\\"At Nedco, we recognise that for an entrepreneur starting a business, access to office space and sound, professional advice and guidance are critical so the ETIIC (Entrepreneurial Training Institute and Incubation Centre), an initiative of Nedco, was established as an institute of excellence to respond to such needs by providing a supportive environment where ideas can be transformed into successful, commercially viable, robust enterprises\\\". According to Rattan, Nedco receives 400 applicants per annum or 35 monthly. In addition to that, they have helped 2,089 individuals through loan financing within the last three years. But overall, she said, the retail services is the sector in greatest demand (34 per cent) followed by Food and Beverage (nine per cent) and Beauty Culture (eight per cent). Hanuman believes, however, that his choice was the best for him. \\\"Starting this new business, I mean it's a lot of work, but there is a joy in it for me 'you are not at the mercy of an employer who would decide to make your position redundant or lay you off'.\\\" \\\"Studies have shown that whenever there is an economic crisis, people want to maintain the ability to live life the same way, they just want to do it for a cheaper price and that's how TopLine came about\\\". \\\"We are providing a service, which is limited and very expensive here in Trinidad, for a cheaper price, and its not that I am using outdated equipment. \\\"I am using top of the line equipment, which is how I came up with the name TopLine\\\". As a new company, Hanuman said they have made themselves available 24/7. For more info about starting your own business contact Nedco at 821-5800.

And therefore it supports the Central Bank initiative to increase its committment to the foreign exchange market from the current level of US$115 million per month to US$200 million per month and to try and deal with some of the queues that have developed, he said. He added that this would add more purchasing power into the system. He was speaking in the debate on the Finance Bill in the House of Representatives yesterday. Dookeran stressed that the country was fortunate because the level of foreign reserves continued to be good. But, he noted: \\\"We cannot become complacent because the trend is not always in the right direction.\\\" He said there was a recognition of the need \\\"to trigger the economy\\\". On the debt to the contractors, he said he was advised that between June and October, the Ministry of Finance spent $2.4 billion to deal with contractors' claims. He said there were other claims which were being dealt with by the Ministry of Housing and Environment. \\\"The problem is not over but we have made a dent in that situation and we hope to remove it over time,\\\" he said. He said on the issue VAT refunds, he noted businesses have been \\\"crying and are in great pain\\\". He said Government had increased the payout of VAT refunds from $350 million to $400 million and was hoping that the VAT office could take it to $500 million. This would also inject some purchasing power. Dookeran said much of the issues Government was grappling with, related to the inheritance which Government got from the PNM. It would have been nice if we could have inherited a clean balance sheet, he said. \\\"Regrettably this is not so,\\\" he added. He said however that \\\"it was comforting\\\" that the international community at large which had been watching carefully the vulnerabilities that the country was faced with and its reponses, had indicated their confidence in Trinidad and Tobago.

He also examined the impliecations for Trinidad and Tobago of the economic declines in the United States and Europe as well as the way the country was managing its oil and gas industry. Following is Warner's full statement: A couple months ago, I had the honour of attending the World Economic Forum in Dalian China. Neal & Massy is the first Trinidadian Company invited for membership into the WEF as one of the Global Growth Champions. The conference was fascinating and eye opening. The magnitude and scale of operations in China is important for us to all understand. Similarly, the effects of the global economic forces and their impact on our small economies is also important for us to understand. Thesis of my speech today is: We, the business community (and I generously include myself), are taking care of our business but we are collectively not leading this country like we need to. As I now understand and appreciate the global economic and geopolitical forces that are currently at work, there is an urgent need for us to step up to further leadership in our twin island republic. I would like to share some Insights World Economic Forum I will break my summary into two parts: (1) Western Trends and (2) Eastern/ Asian Trends (1) Western Trends US and UK shifted banking crisis to a Fiscal problem but do not have the policy consensus to deal with the Fiscal problem. Instruments to address Fiscal problems are politically unpopular. US consumer is deleveraging, slowing down consumption in US. Corporate sectors in the US and around the world is also deleveraging to assure financial strength in times of uncertainty Banking sector has tightened lending criteria with a more pessimistic outlook Large companies are OK, they have cash but SMEs are hurting cash crunch and little access to credit European countries have not taken medicine and seem to be delaying the inevitable In Europe, they have only just realised that the emerging Banking crisis needs to be addressed and there is now a call for increased capitalisation of European banks. However the European Banking Crisis which is arising from sovereign debt problems with the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) needs to be transferred to Fiscal debt and deficits across the wider European Union. The problem will require an international solution IMF (Global) coordination. European Union is being seriously challenged: -Monetary Union without Fiscal or Political Union -When fiscal requirements for membership (Debt/GDP limit, Fiscal Deficit limit) are out of compliance in anyone state, there are no mechanisms for correction other than coercion or threat of leaving the Union -Weakness in the model is being tested and will result in some major changes to the EU. - PIIGS are challenging the viability of the union. The prescribed medicine for Greece is: Improved tax collection, privatization and austerity. However the Greeks don't want to take the medicine and are protesting further assistance from the European Union - how ungrateful. On the other hand, the Germans are facing an increasingly angry public that does not understand why their wealth must be used to save countries like Greece, where the retirement age is much lower, fiscal discipline is not exercised and where help is resisted and resented. All indications are that the US and European markets are going to continue to struggle in the foreseeable future (2) Eastern/Asian Trends Cannot go back to US/Europe Dominance (US cathedral) - 1950s-1980s: US drove consumption and production across world. - 2010: US and Europe were out-produced, out-traded and out-invested by Rest of the World (ROW). - Now: US and Europe still hold the largest stake in base consumption. However, China and Asia drive production and are the primary drivers of consumption growth, along with the other BRIC countries. - By 2020: China and Asia replace US in driving both consumption and production. More economic growth to be driven by emerging market economies, especially China and India. What are the Implications for Trinidad and Tobago Our Caricom, US and UK trading partners are going to see tough times for some time ahead, as US and European consumers will continue to struggle in the medium term while US and Europe sort out their problems. Many of our Caricom partners are facing increasing problems of mounting debt. Barbados (112 per cent Debt to GDP) is on the brink of being downgraded by S&P and Jamaica (136 per cent Debt to GDP) is in a stalemate with the IMF over forward looking targets including: Reducing the wage bill from its 11 per cent of GPD to nine per cent by March 2016; Decline in the debt ratio from 130 per cent to 114 per cent by 2014, and 100 per cent by 2016; Reducing the current account deficit to GDP ratio to five per cent by 2014. Others in financial trouble include St Kitts (196 per cent Debt to GDP) and Grenada (120 per cent Debt to GDP). Although our Oil & Gas industry is providing a cushion, however note: it is not being particularly well managed. Let me summarise the current dynamics of the Oil & Gas Industry Oil production in Trinidad and Tobago has declined steadily over the last 26 years from an average of 176K bopd in 1985 to an average of 94Kbopd YTD 2011. The prize oil producing asset, Trinmar continues to under-perform, producing 22,000 to 23,000 bopd. From 34,000 bopd in 2006, Trinmar's production fell consecutively in 2007 and 2008 and has never regained despite the reserves and potential production of the field. Many experts are confident that the field could be returned to 35,000 to 40,000 bopd production with the right management. Successive Energy Ministers have stated that increasing oil production is of the highest priority, but the single lever that would make the most difference - changing the management paradigm of Trinmar (eg, through a JV or sale to a majority party) continues to be avoided. What's the definition of insanity Doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. Even more depressing is the outlook from the Gas perspective. Over the years, our government did an excellent job of maximising Trinidad & Tobago's take from Oil & Gas operations. When I researched this as a consultant in 2002, we were already among the best. Well we have played this hand beyond its utility. Trinidad is no longer considered among the most attractive investments for gas exploration opportunities and we can see the result in our bid rounds. We fail to attract interest and the little interest we do attract is from second and third tier companies, which do not have the level of technical or financial resources follow deliver new production reserves. As the cost of finding gas increases with exploration taking place further offshore in deeper waters, the price at which gas can be sold to the domestic market increases. Without any relaxation on the government take from upstream producers, downstream plants are experiencing an increase in the cost of their most significant raw material. As a result, our petrochemical downstream industry is also getting less attractive. The only new plant completed for the downstream in the last 3 years was the AUM plant, even though there is always a long litany of prospects that are read at every budget speech. So what, you may ask, should be the Role of Government The role of government is best served as an enabler. The government served very useful catalytic functions in getting the Point Lisas Estate established and kick-starting the petrochemical industry. As much as possible, Government should stay away from running things. Governments are seldom the most efficient agent for manufacturing or delivering any product or service. They are just not structured to do that. Why should the government own a commercial bank, far less two Why must the government operate ports and airports Why does the government own 51 per cent of TSTT Why does the government maintain a monopoly on petroleum marketing Why is our government so big for just 1.3 million people While the Minister of Finance has held out his hand for collaboration with the Private Sector, I have one main problem with the 2012 Budget - it is too big. A $54.6 billion for Total Expenditure net of Capital Repayments and Sinking Fund Contributions represents an 11.4 per cent increase above the budgeted expenditure for last year! Governments, in general, are addicted to expenditure. Once expenditure levels are raised to a level, it is nearly impossible to reduce them - just look at the difficulties in Greece. We are being far too reliant on the Government to spark economic recovery through its spending. It's a dangerous precedent that get increasingly hard to reverse. So what's the Role of Business against this backdrop There is a wave consciousness sweeping across the globe demanding greater responsibility from corporations and businessmen - witness the spread of the \\\"Occupy Wall Street\\\" movement. We are being attacked and criticised for being greedy and acting selfishly. While don't have the protests in Trinidad (yet), we certainly have the commentary. I think the Trinidad business community needs to be a more proactive interlocutor for Minister Dookeran's outstretched hand. I think we need to be more vocal about what we see needs to be done and we need to start taking some bold actions and leading by example. I know this is difficult because we have seen the consequences of speaking up under the different regimes. We have also seen the advantages that accrue from staying in good favour. This however is NOT leadership. This is self-preserving cowardice. I know, I practise it myself. I don't want to jump out of my crease and find myself run -out or stumped and everybody else still batting. We need therefore to find a mechanism to join forces to lead a new initiative, not unlike the original Vision 2020 (which was started as a Masterplan to sustain economic growth, by businessmen and led by businesses, NGO, academics, labour leaders and community based organisations before it became politicised). In 2001, Trevor Boopsingh (RIP) recognised Tsumani of Revenue that the GORTT would receive from the Gas industry and set about getting business people to recognize the need to create a long-term plan to use the wealth that was going to be created to sustain economic growth. A great deal of analysis and consensus building went into that effort at the time. Well it's more than a decade later and times have changed. It's time for us to take the lead again. This time the rallying cry is not the Tsunami of Revenue corning; it's the cliff that lies ahead when the Revenue falls off of it. So I call upon you, this esteemed body of businessmen and women to deliberate on this challenge and hatch a new initiative to thrust business back into the business of leadership. We can bring together other stakeholders such as labour, Universities, NGOs community based organisations and even government to chart a course together through these times of unprecedented uncertainty.

The 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that destroyed part of the Asian business giant's northeast coast could also lead to higher prices of commodities such as wheat, which may trickle down to the region. Goods coming out of Japan could also reflect the change. \\\"I am sensing a realignment of the currency between Japan and the United States,\\\" the acting Prime Minister said during a telephone interview on Saturday. \\\"It could happen. If it does, we could see an increase in prices of commodities coming out of Japan. Locally, that would mostly affect the auto industry directly. In terms of commodities, it would eventually indirectly affect is, if it were to happen.\\\" Dookeran said, however, there is a possibility that natural gas prices could go up as a result of the disaster, from which this country could benefit. \\\"Since nuclear power may now be in short supply, it is possible that we will see a short term rise in natural gas prices, which will be a positive for us,\\\" he said. Japan was up to late last week fighting to prevent a meltdown at its Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, where the reactor has overheated several times since the disaster after a series of explosions destroyed its core cooling mechanisms. Up to late yesterday, Japanese authorities said engineers had managed to lay a cable to Reactor no.2 and were hopeful of reconnection to the power grid, which would restart the pumps that cool the core. A 20-kilometre Exclusion Zone is still in effect around the plant amidst fears of a radiation leaks. Dookeran said the Government has continued its partnership with the Red Cross Society, through which donations can be made to aid in the relief of those in Japan affected by the disaster. \\\"We are allowing donations to pass through them (Red Cross) and we encourage citizens to take part,\\\" Dookeran said. He added this country has not so far been able to reap any benefits from the increased oil prices of the last quarter but this could change if the increase is sustained throughout this fiscal quarter. \\\"It was as we had projected for the first quarter but we have not been able to benefit yet,\\\" Dookeran said. Local oil production has also not been as vibrant as was hoped, further inhibiting profit. \\\"We might lose out because of low production but that depends on whether the price is sustained for this quarter,\\\" Dookeran said.

Celebrating 135 years of Service to our business community is no small feat. The Chamber has a rich history of community building and of being one of the leading change agents for our nation. Our Vision today To be the Voice of Business in the ongoing development towards a strong, sustainable national economy is, most likely, much the same as it was when we were established in 1879. This celebration in 2014 is more than a remembrance of the Chambers past accomplishments; it is also a celebration of a new vision to inspire leadership for our future. It is a purpose-driven celebration, delivering meaningful results while enhancing public awareness and perceptions of the Chambers role in advancing our business community and our wider nation to achieve a strong, sustainable economy. This is a mandate that requires strong, sustainable and responsible leadership at all levels of society whether in the context of government, business, education, community and civic organisations, and neighbourhoods that will strengthen and truly transform our nation. This is the second time I have been given the privilege to address our Annual Business Meeting as president of the T&T Chamber, and, one year ago I introduced myself as the leader who wanted to define my presidency at the Chamber by Building Bridges for the Common Good of business and the wider national community. I said we would create or reinforce those bridges between the public and private sector and civil society that would help take our country forward, based on openness, courage and innovation. I believe that over the past year, the Chamber has made great strides in achieving what we set out to do. In 2013, we gave more focus to undertaking much research, and were able to take some strong stands on a number of matters which are very important to you, our Members. Increased and efficient trade is a crucial area in the growth and development of business. Recognising this, our Chamber is the only business service organisation which offers a Unit dedicated to International Trade Negotiations services: our International Trade Negotiations Unit. This is our mechanism for facilitating national trade policy and facilitating growth of business in Trinidad and Tobago. In 2013, the ITNU continued to represent our members interests in ongoing negotiations with Guatemala, El Salvador and Canada. The ITNU has been working closely with the Ministry of Trade, Investment and Industry and other business organisations to solidify preferential access for local companies in the areas of goods, services and investment. Minister, we publicly thank you and Minister of Finance for your financial support of this initiative. While the negotiations with Guatemala concluded in 2013 and those with El Salvador are almost complete, negotiations with Canada now face a June 2014 deadline that is rapidly approaching. Due to the significant trading interest involved, I use this opportunity to strongly urge the Government to do all possible to ensure the maintenance of preferential access into the Canadian market. Also on the Trade Negotiations front, the Chamber continues to seek our members interests at numerous Continues on Page 17 meetings relating to the operation of the Caricom Single Market and Economy, the most significant of which is the meeting of the Council for Trade and Economic Development (Coted). Private sector input and interaction is vital for the enhanced operation of the Single Market, and so I encourage our Members to actively participate and use every opportunity to contribute to the CSME, via the Chamber. Lobbying and advocacy on behalf of the business community continue to be the mainstay of the Chambers efforts. We have hosted closed-door meetings with several Government Ministers and Leaders of State Agencies, including the Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment; the Minister of Finance and the Economy; the Minister of National Security; the Governor of the Central Bank; and the Comptroller of Customs and Excise, just to name a few. We have seen positive outcomes from these discussions the most recent being our meeting with the National Security Minister. In 2013, we continued our participation in the 2013-2014 National pre-Budget consultation process, canvassing the views our Members via e-surveys and at our Annual Pre-Budget Panel Discussion, which offered us the opportunity to coordinate the interests and concerns relevant to the business community for inclusion in the National Budget. Using this feedback, we submitted our recommendations to the Finance Ministry in May, and met with the Minister of Finance and the Economy to make our formal presentation, where we advocated for change or improvements in various areas of national importance. We have also called on the government to give a formal account of its specific commitments outlined in the Budget. In particular, our Tobago Division, currently chaired by Diane Hadad, has done tremendous work over the past few years lobbying to the Central Government and the Tobago House of Assembly on the issues that have affected the development of our sister isle, such as air and sea transport. The Division has worked steadfastly to assist in the implementation of the $250million Tourism Development Fund, the brainchild of the Division, which offers debt restructuring for tourism-related businesses and upgrade of room stock for small to medium sized hotels. Tobagos economy continues to decline and we advocate to the authorities to deal with Tobagos issues with some level of urgency. For several years, our Chamber has been insistent that the authorities must put the necessary mechanisms in place in the best interest of the development of our business community, and, by extension, the economy. Happily, our collaborative relationship with successive Governments has always allowed a willingness on their part to listen and take our views on board. However, we believe that it takes too much time for the authorities to translate willingness into action and full implementation. The successive changes in Government Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, and their portfolios, have all had a drastic impact on timely implementation. What causes further delays, is that each new leader in their respective Ministries wants to review and put their own stamp on already-agreed plans.

It is important, however to examine Tobago in a historical context before proceeding. Tobago was initially incorporated as a ward of Trinidad during the colonial period in 1898. It was mainly a peasant economy with a few plantations producing for export - sugar and cocoa. Small scale farming supported the subsistence needs of the domestic population. Additionally, these farmers also worked for the plantation owners under the Metayage System (to produce crops and give half to the plantation owner, as payment for rental of land) and provided some cash crops for export, mainly to Trinidad as well as sugar and cocoa production for export by the plantation owners. By the mid 1970s to the early 1980s, as a result of mega-projects and investments in oil in Trinidad, the Central Government became the main driver of the economy through state corporations, the expansion of the public sector and social programmes. Whether Tobago benefited equitably from the increasing government revenues became a moot point which led to the passage of the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) Act which was established in 1980. In that year, it had become clear that Trinidad and Tobago could no longer depend on the energy and petrochemical sector for growth and foreign exchange. As the country became more sensitive of the need to diversify, greater focus was given to tourism as an engine of growth. Some thirty-odd years later, while several sectors for diversification have been identified, there has been no clear way forward for their development. This includes the tourism sector in Tobago, despite several strategic plans for the development of the sector which have been articulated by successive governments. Nevertheless, tourism in Tobago has still grown in strength over time, and has managed to become a well- established destination in the international tourism market. Apart from the public sector it remains the main employer and generator of foreign exchange. It is well-known that Tobago's tourism industry has seen sharp declines over the past five years. When the decline started after the events in the USA of September 11, 2001, steps were taken to revive the Industry and average occupancy levels moved from about 17 per cent to over 60 per cent, with the Tourism Rolling Plan introduced by the Government. Since 2006, the decline has been devastating to the Industry. It is important to note that this sector is estimated as representing 46 per cent of Tobago's GDP, 57 per cent of its employment and 96 per cent of its exports, and has thus had a tremendous adverse effect on the economic activity in Tobago. The decline of the tourism industry in Tobago represents a major loss in revenue for the Government and increasing tension on already strained resources. Furthermore, many of Tobago's large businesses are subsidiaries of Trinidad-based organizations and thus their negative bottom lines with increasing risk impacts on their Trinidad counterparts. Also, the free movement of the labour force between Trinidad and Tobago would imply that as the economic situation in Tobago worsens there would be increasing migration to Trinidad and emigration to other countries, which represents another major loss of resources and a loss of industry knowledge. The Chamber, through our Tobago Division, has been one of the stakeholders involved in drafting a Stimulus Plan for the Tobago Tourism industry. We support its implementation in order to rescue Tobago from this current crisis. However, the stimulus plan should be only one component of an overall development plan for Tobago's tourism sector. The question now becomes who should draft and implement a long-term development plan for Tobago and how does this fit into the wider nation The lack of success of the Tobago House of Assembly is not dissimilar to many parts of the world where centralized governments have failed to bring desired outcomes. This phenomenon has brought about the advent of Local Economic Development (LED) as an alternative approach to centralised government. According to the World Bank, 'the purpose of LED is to build the economic capacity of a local area to improve its economic future and the quality of life for all. It is a process by which public, business and nongovernmental sector work collectively to create better conditions'. LED, therefore basically refers to development strategies and while these work best in more developed areas there has been considerable success in areas of employment, development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and engaging underprivileged groups such as the informal sector, women and the uneducated in society. While traditional strategies adopt a sectoral approach, LED takes a territorial approach; traditional strategies generally take a top down approach and LED strategies are structured to take a bottom up approach; also, local institutions which plan and implement LED programmes are more adaptable and interact with local economic stakeholders. Further, there have been whispers of making Tobago a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) which essentially incorporates the principles of a geographically delimited area, singularly managed with separate Customs (duty-free benefits) and streamlined procedures and eligibility for benefits based on location within this zone. The Chamber sees such an initiative as one that would complement the stimulus plan for Tobago and which would form part of a wider plan for the island and a national development plan. It should be part of an overall growth strategy to enhance industry competitiveness and attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to develop and diversify exports. The Chamber notes that such zones are most successful when they are privately owned, developed and operated, and when they are used as a supplement to country wide reform in regulatory, trade and investment. In terms of the incentive framework, encouraging zones to compete not on the basis of the provision of incentives but on that of facilitation, facilities and services has been identified as a best practice. Emphasis should also be placed on the importance of operating on a cost recovery basis that is market-oriented rather than a subsidized basis. With all this said the Chamber therefore encourages structured, inclusive dialogue to be held in Tobago with key stakeholders to come to agreement on its social and economic priorities to improve Tobago's future. The Chamber's Tobago Division has begun the process of identifying key areas that need immediate improvement in Tobago which was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Economy and can be found on the Chamber's website. To take the discussion further there needs to be greater collaboration with stakeholders and the recognition and discussion of their recommendations on the way forward. Thus, the Chamber stands able and willing to engage key stakeholders on this issue with the hope of finding a way forward for Tobago and the wider Trinidad and Tobago economy.

I do not subscribe to that perspective. These economies may be broken but I believe we can pick up the pieces.

The odds are immediately stacked against Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar and Minister of Finance Winston Dookeran. By his own account, and in a June 11 report on the state of the economy, Dookeran points out \\\"in simple terms\\\" that the government's total cash balances have declined from $17.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2008 to a $5.43 billion as at June 2010. An even though crude oil prices have risen steadily to around US$75 a barrel , the price of natural gas- the country's main revenue earner- has been weak and has averaged around US$4 per mmbtu. The Dookeran report projects that this could fall even lower given the significant gas exports from Australia and Qatar and the large deposits of shale gas in the United States that are now being economically produced. The minister has also suggested that the large sums of excess liquidity in the commercial banking system be used in more innovative ways to encourage the development of small and medium-sized businesses. As Minister Dookeran and his team at the ministry prepare the 2010 national budget, there will have to be a reexamination of how Trinidad and Tobago governments have spent the country's earnings. There will also need to consistent attention given to revitalising the economy which is still feeling the effects of the global downturn and which is projected to register little or no growth this year.

In what was the fourth consecutive negative-growth year for the national economy, the Group enjoyed revenues of $5.9 billion, improving its profit before tax to $952 million. With an asset base of more than $11 billion, the conglomerate boasts of contributing upward of $1 billion in taxes and employing 6,000 persons. By any measure, here is a corporate citizen of which we can be proud. In its long history, it has expanded and grown through a clever combination of vision on the part of its founders and principals, innovation, acquisition and plain hard work. Interestingly, McAL has built its fortunes on only minor interventions in the lucrative energy sector, proving that even in and oil and gas economy it is possible to thrive outside the hydrocarbons orbit. As the corporations board and senior executives celebrated another successful year, Chief Operating Officer Gerry Brooks made some noteworthy statements. He observed that companies in the Group accounted for 15 per cent of the capitalised value of the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange, and the Group was the biggest taxpayer outside of the energy sector. He also trumpeted the Groups corporate social interventions, particularly those in education, research and innovation. Brooks hinted that the Group was aiming at breaking into the elite global club of the Fortune 1000, which would be quite an achievement if or when that happens. What is remarkable about ANSA McALs consistent performanceit topped $1 billion in profit in 2010 and 2011is the conglomerates diverse spread. Its 60-plus subsidiaries encompass manufacturing, brewing, construction, automotive, trading, distribution, insurance, finance, real estate and media. While its main activities are located in Trinidad and Tobago, it conducts business in other Caribbean countries and in North America. The corporations success has not been without challenges, negatives that most private sector enterprises complain about, but which successive governments seem to be powerless to rectify. A major obstacle lies in the operations of the countrys principal ports at Port of Spain and Point Lisas. Companies like McAL, which rely heavily on import and export of goods, complain about inefficiencies at these ports that increase the cost of doing business. Brooks described the ports as a perennial hindrance, adding, When you are trying to export in the last quarter and the Port lacks efficiency, you will have afforded shelf space in a key market and you simply cannot export your goods. What happens is that space is taken by someone else. With containerised cargo being the prime means of international shipping trade, efficiency is measured in moves per hour, and our ports are said to lag behind international benchmarks. A related and costly anomaly is the fact that Port Point Lisas, the countrys second biggest port, is still deemed an outport by Customs. What this means is that for any work conducted by Customs personnel outside of regular working hours, overtime payment kicks in (rather than a shift system, as obtains at Port of Spain). This additional cost is borne by PLIPDECO (the port operators) and consignees. It is a grossly unfair burden that hurts business, and by extension, the economy. In an interview with the Business Express last week, Brooks alluded to a public and private sector partnership relative to the countrys ports, in which, presumably, ANSA McAL might have an interest. Shortly after it assumed office, the current Government listed a number of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises that it proposed to divest. The Point Lisas Port was one such company. In noting other challenges his company faced, Brooks pointed to crime being a disincentive to investment and a major cost by way of security measures. He also lamented the continuing complexities of doing business in the absence of a single electronic window, something a number of trade ministers have grappled with, thus far unsuccessfully. The success of conglomerates like ANSA McAL bodes well for the economic well-being of the country. Such corporate giants do not seek state subvention. They ask only that Government pave the road to doing business, removing obstacles to success.

The PM has described a video showing a man resembling a government minister wrapping what appears to be a marijuana cigarette as \\u0093dirty tactics\\u0094 by the opposition People\\u0092s National Movement (PNM). \\u0097Photo: DEXTER PHILIP The e-mail crisis which we are currently experiencing can be traced directly to the issue of the funding of elections and political parties. Two of the individuals who are said to be at the centre of the controversy about Section 34, Ish Galbaransingh and Steve Ferguson, are major financiers of the United National Congress (UNC) and the People's Partnership. Another alleged financier, Jack Warner, was heard to say that he was in a way responsible for many of the UNC parliamentarians being in office. I assume he was saying that he invested in the UNC's election campaign and bought out its leader and its parliamentary team. One recalls the adage that election campaigns are occasions when political leaders earn money, whether their party wins, loses, or draws. After every election that is stained by scandal, proposals arise seeking to fix the rules relating to campaign financing, including demands for public funding of such campaigns. The demand is usually made by the losing parties As we reminded readers in last Sunday's Express, money has always been one of the prime sinews of politics. In many contexts, it is the most important political resource, the sine qua non which determines most though not all outcomes. As we argued, it is particularly the case in small societies. In the contemporary era, one needs money to purchase television time which in most societies is the most expensive commodity. Money is also needed to acquire the skills and services of advertising companies, polling consultants, vehicular equipment and all the other supports that are required to enhance and improve performances in contemporary elections. \\\"Treating\\\" has become big business. In most Caribbean island societies T-shirts are also an expensive electoral commodity. Wearing these shirts not only advertises political identity but also indicates how much support one's party has. Some people accumulate several just for the sake of doing so because they have not yet made up their minds. There has been much debate in the region and elsewhere as to how the funding problem might best be addressed. One strongly held point of view in the Caribbean is that political parties are private organisations even though they serve a very important public purpose. These political \\\"clubs\\\" should therefore be left to manage their own affairs, including the sourcing of funds to meet the cash needs of their operations. Why, many ask, should scarce taxpayers funds be used to support private organisations and their leaders who are in the main corrupt, power driven, and ineffective The other view, which is strongly held, is that political parties are much too important a public resource to be left unregulated. In some parts of the Americas, they are seen as the only remaining bulwark which prevents states from becoming narco-states in which power is bought and sold as a commodity. They need to be strengthened rather than be left to fend for themselves. Parties and elections have however become much too expensive to maintain. The main problem is that legitimate funding for them has become very scarce. In the post-Independence era, political elites were able to secure funding from members and well wishers, and from the new industries and from businesses which were being established. They were also supported by friendly governments and organisations which had an interest in making capitalism and democracy work sustainably or who saw them as milch cows. The economic structures of most Caribbean economies have however changed significantly and so too have investment patterns. Money is rapidly drying up or forthcoming mainly from Asian states such as Japan, or one or other of the two Chinas. Absent these sources, significant money is only available from big contractors, narco-traffickers and money launderers who are buying protection, or strategically placed elites who expect to be paid back. In many cases, offshore narco traffickers are rapidly replacing the small firms of yesterday. Dirty money significantly distorts our electoral processes, calling into question their transparency and legitimacy of our democratic systems. No Anglo Caribbean state has yet become a fully blown narco-state, but some leaders and those who want to become leaders are becoming dependent on drug money for the wherewithal to fund elections. Many states have become satellites of either Taiwan, Beijing and, more recently of Caracas. We have witnessed unseemly rivalries in countries such as Grenada, St Lucia, Antigua and St Kitts. Recall the role of Stanford in financing elections in Antigua. Complaints have also been forthcoming from Jamaica and Guyana that drugs are influencing, if not determining electoral or policy outcomes. In Trinidad and Tobago, the search for the dozen \\\"Mr Bigs\\\" said to exist continues. FIFA money is also reported to have been used to fix elections. The procurement regimes in all these states are seriously compromised. Money which is made available to fund elections or bribe elites invariably has to be paid back once the outcomes are determined. Section 34 is directly related to funding for elections. With the possible exception of the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago, Caribbean ano-states are not fiscally viable. Seven of them are among the most indebted states in the world. They are all drowning in debt and constantly have to approach bondholders and the IMF for accommodations to avoid the wolf at the door. Costs involved in servicing this debt represent a heavy burden on taxpayers and a disincentive to investment, foreign or local. Given the scarcity of money, and given the rising costs of elections, the question arises as to where does one get the wherewithal to service the routine needs of parties before and after elections. The answer, say some concerned groups, is not whether one resorts to public funding or not, but how much to allow them to spend and the form the distribution should take. What then is to be done Is public funding the answer All the states with the exception of Suriname share roughly similar views about public funding. They consider it an essentially un-British thing to do, even if Britain herself has adopted the arrangement, all be it in limited form. As we have argued however, the question is not whether there is public funding or not, but funding in what proportions and under what conditions. The answer to that question depends on what is already on the ground in terms of the type of electoral system that exists, the nature of the political and community values, the social stratification pattern which obtains and the amount of money that is available. Critically too is the viability, audit capability and regulatory integrity of the institutions that are available to the society. It is also pointless establishing public funding regimes if the elites steal the funds with impunity, spend it without due care and attention, find ways to avoid being both politically and legally accountable. The big question is whether it is practically possible. If the answer to the latter is in the negative, what do we do The one option that is not available to us is to leave things as they are to the modern buccaneers and picaroons.

Each of those articles said much the same thing and gave the same general prescriptions. The key point made in those articles was that we would never deal with the crime situation until and unless we stopped seeing it through partisan political lenses. The war against crime, I argued, had to be a national effort if only because it would involve decisions and actions which would bring down any single government and therefore had to be the responsibility of the nation as a whole. In the period since I wrote the first such article the viciously partisan nature of our politics has grown more extreme and the prospects of building a national effort on crime, or on anything else, have become almost non-existent. Because of this view I did not see any reason for writing any more articles on crime every time there was a surge or spike in the murder rate or, as one official used to say, in the number of \\u201chomo-cides\\u201d. While this reality has not changed it is true that there has been a change in the national context which is significant enough to dramatically change the whole structure of our crime problem. I am referring here to the financial and economic problem being faced by the country as a result of the precipitous decline in international oil and gas prices. It is not difficult to see how the resultant decline in revenues could in turn have an impact on the crime problem. The fact is that in the absence of any effective crime-fighting plan and in the absence of capable and trusted crime-fighting agencies, the one strategy which has been used by successive governments to try to stem the rate of escalation in crime has been that of buying off with money transfers poorly disguised as make-work contracts \\u201chotspots\\u201d and those persons who it is perceived are likely to turn to a life of crime. This is what Sir David Simmons was referring to recently when he is reported as saying that \\u201cthroughout the Caribbean, especially Trinidad and Jamaica, there was evidence which showed political parties embraced gang leaders and drug lords\\u201d including politicians involving those criminals in state-funded projects. Now that the national coffers are considerably depleted and it is difficult to find the wherewithal to fund even legitimate development projects, it is evident that the policy of buying off criminals, established and/or potential, cannot continue on the same scale as it did before and will not work, if it ever did, to reduce the rate of crime escalation. We may already be seeing the impact of this reality. There is no question that violent criminal activity and murder in particular, has been on the increase over the course of the year. Nothing the Government has done or tried to do, from increasing the number of ministers in the Ministry of National Security, to reintroducing join military/police patrols, has had the slightest impact on that relentless increase. When therefore Gregory Aboud of the Downtown Owners and Merchants Association (DOMA) recently issued a call for Prime Minister Rowley to take charge of the Government's crime-fighting effort he was merely reflecting the desperate insecurity which many citizens feel. In fact Mr Aboud had called for more effective action on crime several times this year. And when the heads of two business associations could say in response to Dr Rowley's statement that the Government was doing its best that \\u201cthat best was not good enough\\u201d we begin to understand that the national mood is on the boil with regard to the crime issue. Unfortunately there is no relief in sight. If, as I have argued, the steady escalation in violent crime over this year is attributable to the declining financial and economic condition of the country, then we also have to realise that, notwithstanding the Minister of Finance's proclivity for living in a fool's paradise, that financial and economic situation is not going to get any better any time soon. Because of that the old practice of throwing money at the criminals is not going to work anymore. The country simply does not have the resources to continue with that strategy. But in the face of that reality there is a chance for the Government to abandon all the old, discredited and unworkable \\u201ccrime plans\\u201d we have essayed so many times before. The Leader of the Opposition has called for talks with Dr Rowley on the crime situation. It may just be the opening that the country needs to forge a real commitment to a national war against crime. If we fail in this again then we had better prepare ourselves for a long winter of discontent.

It said during the quarter ending July, production in the energy sector was affected by planned maintenance and upgrade related downtime at the major oil and gas producers and by lower output associated with maturing oil fields. In recent years, energy companies have placed increased focus on maintenance in order to meet higher safety standards. On the non-energy side, construction slowed in the context of slower execution of government-related projects. On the other hand, some uptick in activity was observed in the Finance sector,\\u201d the CBTT said. It said that the contraction in the domestic economy is slowly impacting the labour market, as the unemployment rate trended upwards and the labour force participation rate declined. \\u201cNevertheless, unemployment remains low and there are anecdotal reports of shortages in certain specialist skill areas as well as in some low-wage jobs in the distribution sector. \\u201cThe labour market data for the fourth quarter of 2015 shows that the rate of unemployment rose to 3.5 per cent from 3.3 per cent in the corresponding year-earlier period, and of the estimated 22,300 persons unemployed, 57.0 per cent were males. Moreover the number of persons without jobs rose by 400 persons, but the effect on the unemployment rate was attenuated by a fall in the labour force.\\u201d The CBTT said that retrenchment data filed at the Ministry of Labour and Small Enterprise Development point to continued softening of the labour market, as some 690 persons were retrenched in the first seven months of 2016. In the midst of a subdued domestic economy, headline inflation remained relatively contained, increasing to 3.4 per cent at the end of June 2016 from 2.4 per cent at the beginning of the year. The CBTT said other price indicators such as building material and producer prices indices also showed moderate increases. Since jumping sharply in February 2016 following the broadening of the Value Added Tax (VAT) base, food inflation has settled around nine per cent. The Central bank said that more broadly, some price increases have been linked to the depreciation of the domestic currency vis-\\u00e0-vis the US dollar. It said the currency depreciated by roughly four per cent during the first six months of 2016. \\u201cHowever, the full pass-through of these increases may not yet have occurred given the lag in transmission, while some businesses may have chosen to absorb rising costs in the interim. In addition, some consumers may be substituting local goods for imported goods. \\u201cEmphasising the generally sedate inflationary environment, core inflation remained relatively flat and measured 2.2 per cent as at June 2016, after starting the year at 2.0 per cent.\\u201d The CBTT said that in the context of the deterioration of the international energy markets, which has resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices, Central Government fiscal accounts worsened in the first nine months of the fiscal year. It said the Central Government deficit rose to TT$6.2 billion (One TT dollar =US$0.16 cents) over the first nine months of the fiscal year compared to TT$2.2 billion in the corresponding year-earlier period. The CBTT said in the financial year 2015/16 mid-year budget review, the Minister of Finance, Colm Imbert, proposed several measures to boost non-energy revenue and to streamline expenditure, some of which would be implemented in the upcoming financial year. It said on the financing side, the government used overdraft financing at the Central Bank, but also borrowed on the local and international markets and accessed the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund (HSF). During the first nine months of fiscal year 2015/16, the Keith Rowley government borrowed a total of TT$4.9 billion in the domestic market, while in August 2016 the government receive \\u201cThe tenor of the bond is 10 years at a coupon rate of 4.5 per cent. The bond issue brought external debt as a per cent of GDP to 13.6 per cent. In May 2016, the Government withdrew US$375 million from the HSF, which was the first drawdown since the establishment of the Fund in 2007.\\u201d The CBTT said monetary conditions remained stable in the first seven months of 2016. \\u201cWith inflation low and broadly comfortable interest rate differentials against US short-term securities, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago has been able to hold its repo rate constant at 4.75 per cent since January in the context of the slowing economy. \\u201cLiquidity levels also remained broadly controlled, although they fluctuated during the seven-month period under review. Over January to April 2016, commercial banks' excess reserves averaged TT$3.9 billion daily, but rose to an average of TT$6.0 billion daily over May and June as the financial institutions geared up to participate in bond issues by the Government. \\u201cSubsequently, liquidity levels fell to a daily average of TT$3.6 billion in July 2016. Meanwhile, in light of the ongoing conditions of disequilibrium in the domestic foreign exchange market as a consequence of a major terms-of-trade shock, the local currency depreciated against the US dollar by 3.8 per cent in the first seven months of 2016,\\u201d the CBTT added. It said that the latest available estimates show that the external accounts deteriorated in 2015 to register an overall deficit of roughly US$1.5 billion, which represented a reversal of the US$1.3 billion surplus in 2014. \\u201cThe current account is estimated to have recorded a deficit of US$101.2 million in 2015 due in large part to a weakened merchandise trade account as the value of exports fell by about one quarter. Merchandise imports were also lower, by 16.0 per cent, on account of lower energy imports,\\u201d the CBTT added.

This is incorporated in a desire for, and practices of, technological solutions, managerial accountability, standardised assessment, and hyper-competition, which generate a consistent and reliable product efficiently and economically. In Education and the Cult of Efficiency (1962), Raymond E Callahan, presented an in-depth social-historical analysis of the personalities and sociocultural forces that influenced the actions of educational administrators in the first three decades of the 20th century, and through which business values, practices, and ideology had come to influence, if not dominate, the culture of educational administrators and schools. His analysis has a lot to offer us. Beginning in 1900, he argues that the visible successes of science, business, and industry in the 19th century gave them a position of ideological prestige and influence in the American psyche. This manifested in demands for more utilitarian, vocational or practical curricula within a changing national context of mass immigration, semi-literacy, cultural diversity, poverty, inflation, and suspicion of inefficient institutions, and created conditions for the emergence of efficiency experts who successfully advocated the application of business methods in education. From these ideas about economy and efficiency flowed rational and justifiable decisions to increase class size or the number of classes taught by a teacher, reduce salaries, narrow or eliminate inefficient curricula, and remove unproductive \\\"laggards\\\" from the schools. In the next two decades, these ideas would be elaborated in attempts to maximise the use of the school plant by shuffling students among rooms and so reduce the unit cost of education, and to develop systems of educational accounting that made simple acts stiflingly complicated and ushered in a bureaucratic hegemony that weakened the bonds of trust among teachers, administrators, and clerks. Finally, in the period following WWII, marketing and the science of propaganda's potential for shaping and directing public perception of business and creating \\\"good will\\\" would give rise to the public relations expert, who, like his efficiency expert counterpart of the earlier era, would bring fresh ideas and insight gleaned from business and industry into the educational realm and cement the standardisation of the operation of schools as a \\\"businesslike organisation.\\\" In trying to understand what he perceived as the unexpected capitulation of educational administrators to public criticism and the demand for business-like success and industrial efficiency, Callahan proposed what is now referred to as the vulnerability thesis. He argued that because of the way their school systems were financed and organised, those responsible for educational administration perennially found their security of tenure vulnerable to public criticism and subsequent dismissal. This corporeal fear of dismissal, he argued, often resulted in their abdicating their leadership responsibilities by yielding to the external demands for the application of business methods in education, with neither sufficient nor appropriate considerations as to whether such methods were suited to educational goals beyond efficiency, standardisation, and accountability. Similarly, he showed that teachers' instructional focus over the same period had shifted to student/class management, as they had come to adopt and implement some of the business strategies in their classrooms in order to please their administrators and their school boards, which had become dominated by businessmen. To reduce the vulnerability of educators, Callahan concluded that the organisation and financing of school systems would have to be changed, that the quality of the preparation of educational leaders in universities would have to be improved, and that both of these would have to occur more or less concurrently. These would help to counter the tragedy of modern education in which \\\"educational questions were subordinated to business considerations; administrators were produced who were not, in any true sense, educators; a scientific label was put on some very unscientific and dubious methods and practices and an anti-intellectual climate, already prevalent was strengthened\\\" which resulted in education being practiced in a \\\"businesslike, mechanical, organisational way.\\\" Very little has changed and the situation will continue to worsen until we review this ideology of \\\"business\\\" in education and make education/evocation a human(e) business.

The Washington-based financial institution said the St Lucia government, the private sector, civil society, youth and academia have concluded that the country has made significant progress in meeting its commitments made at the start of the second accountability workshop of the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) held here. The World Bank said the St Lucian Growth Forum (GF) chapter is coordinated by the Department of Planning & National Development of the Ministry of Finance, and comprises representatives of the Government and private sector in collaboration with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Compete Caribbean and theCaribbean Development Bank(CDB). Over the last decade, St Lucia has grabbled with the challenge of reshaping its economy; growth has been slow and unemployment, particularly among the youth, high. The CGF has provided a forum to assist the government in implementing reforms needed for the country to become more competitive and innovative, The World Bank said. The Washington-based financial institution said the discussion underscored enhanced Internet, information communications technology (ICT)-related services and infrastructure, fiscal incentives for improved business climate, and boost in productivity. It said the St Lucia Ministry of the Public Service has established Wi Fi hot spots at key locations throughout the island, that a community access centre is now accessible and available to residents in the town of Soufriere, and construction of two new ICT access centres has commenced in Micoud North and Vieux-Fort South. St Lucia will be the recipient of a Government Island Network Project destined to create Wi Fi hotspots island-wide, the World Bank said, adding Wi Fi hot spots will also be created at libraries throughout the island to increase access to communities and schools. In assessing fiscal incentives for improved business climate, the bank said the St Lucia Department of Finance has commenced work to enhance the effectiveness of the current incentives regime and improve transparency of incentives. This project is expected to provide additional support to private sector development by re-focusing the incentives regime on specific development objectives, it said. Through the National Productivity Council, the World Bank noted that the St Lucia Government completed the first productivity assessment, an innovative approach that includes teaching youth and providing tools to increase on productivity in the workplace. It also said that the Economic Planning Unit within the St. Lucia Department of Planning & National Development is facilitating continued dialogue and implementation of CGF activities. The CGFs St Lucia Chapter was formally launched in January 2013 under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, Planning and Social Security. The World Bank said the CGF provides a platform for private sector and civil society to give feedback on national and regional reforms and help track the implementation of actions needed to spur sustainable growth and opportunities for all in the Caribbean.
