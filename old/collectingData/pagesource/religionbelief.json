A little push of any one may result in an entirely unpredictable outcome, hence the name \\\"chaos\\\". The most popular imagery, and I emphasise the word imagery, is of the connectivity of a butterfly flitting its wings in the depths of the Amazon rainforest leading to a devastating typhoon in the Pacific Ocean. It is largely a mathematical construct that may be projected into the real world. The remarkable thing about the construct is that any system arising from a tiny push while apparently chaotic may display its own highly ordered structure. Although well-intentioned the Integrity in Public Life Act became chaotic for two reasons the net of persons affected was much widened, and, the Commission, despite its many failings and self-inflicted wounds, it was never provided with the human and other resources to meet its responsibilities. And it may become even more chaotic as it reacts to external pressures such as a little push from Dr Rowley. Readers of this column may very well question the connection of abstract theory and the now rather thorny issue of conflicts of interest. Each of us will have a range of interests. Institutions, even churches, may also have ranges of interests. A conflict may arise where the individual or institution, in their normal activities, has an interest that, if pursued, may possibly influence their pursuit of another interest that might lead to some sort of impropriety or corruption. An insurance claims assessor, for example, does not evaluate claims for a relative's property, nor does an attorney represent both sides of a conflict between parties. The important point to note is that most people and institutions are able to recognise such conflicts and eliminate them in different ways before they metamorphose from possible to real conflict, and chaos. The ways in which conflicts of interest may be eliminated vary but the common approaches at the personal level may be either simple avoidance, or open disclosure of interest, or recusal from the particular conflict or third party resolution. At public and professional levels special codes of practice may be developed informing parties of what is expected of them. It is not uncommon in our Parliament for example for individuals to state an interest but contribute to a debate on the matter. As has been emphasised by both Martin Daly and Dana Seetahal, who addressed the broad issue as opposed to giving legal opinions, both clearly defined the boundaries of the envelope of the power of the Commission. Now that the Integrity Commission has created the precedent of commenting publicly on a matter \\\"actively in the public sphere\\\" it will be much challenged even if or when it considers the matter of the Lighthouse of the Lord Jesus Christ Church, a matter even more hyperactive in the public sphere. Religion is and has been a powerful, emotive, violent and often divisive influence in human affairs, historically much involved in conflicts of one kind or another, often exercising power over others, while having no monopoly on morality. And in this country, although in theory a secular state where religion plays mainly a ritual role in the affairs of the State, the Constitution does nevertheless guarantee freedom of conscience and religious belief and observance. Thus any investigation of any impropriety or corruption of any church, regardless of the size of its congregations or body of beliefs and rituals is bound to be contentious. Why should this be so Potential conflicts of interest! Anyone party to investigating the matter who happens to be seen to be in a leadership position of the same religious persuasion, or of the same family of beliefs, or for that matter a member of any religion, will see the immediate conflict. I would think also that there would be a similar conflict for any avowed atheist. The believers, especially those closest to that particular brand, might simply go overboard in softening the approach while the atheists might be rather heavy handed. Possibly only rational agnostics might be able to look into the matter objectively. The Commission is conducting and enquiry into the Guanapo church matter, hopefully in its own deliberate judgement and not on any directive from the executive and not on the basis of it being \\\"actively in the public sphere\\\". While the Commission has considerable powers of investigation it is procedurally bound by Section 34 at the end of which if it suspects an offence has been committed it can do no more than report to the Director of Public Prosecutions \\\"who may take such actions as he thinks appropriate\\\"! The Chairman with his admission of pastorship of a church must therefore now recuse himself from any involvement in the Guanapo chaos. Moreover the Chairman must avoid expressing personal opinions that may be misconstrued as being that of the Integrity Commission.

But most people inherit their religion from their parents and know very little about what other religions teach. For example, according to the Hebrew Old Testament, about 4,000 years ago a man named Abraham had an encounter with God. Brought up under a polytheist religion, he firmly established the tenet of monotheism, which made the Jews a people apart. Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people and it was the first great faith to hold that there is only one God. Christianity, on the other hand, was born about 2,000 years ago in Israel with the story of its founder Jesus of Nazareth, who, it is written, was crucified and willingly gave up his life for the redemption of humanity. But Christianity sprang from Judaism and it is said that he who encounters Jesus, encounters Judaism for according to his human nature, Jesus in his incarnation was a Jew. Islam is by far the youngest of the three religions. It originated in the 7th century AD, but its conceptual roots are in Judaism and Christianity. Muhammad was its founder. He is considered to be a prophet like Moses and the one who guided the Arabs towards monotheistic truth. When it began in the desert region of Arabia, it was initially considered an \\\"Arab religion for the Arabs,\\\" just as Judaism was the religion of the Jews many centuries before. All Christians firmly believe that Jesus is the Son of God. To Islam, however, Jesus is only \\\"a creature\\\" and Islam honours him as a true prophet and not as the Son of God. Muhammad, on the other hand, is said in the Qu'ran to be \\\"the Seal of the Prophets\\\" (Qu'ran 33:40), the last and greatest of the prophets, and the one who finally closes the series. However, the miracles which Jesus performed are interpreted as being manifestations of his divinity. But unlike Jesus, Muhammad had no miraculous powers, and when asked by his fellow citizens to show them a miracle, which would prove his right to claim that he was a prophet, he appealed to the Qu'ran. The miracle, he said, was the Qu'ran. Now, a crucial Christian belief, \\\"the mystery\\\" of the Trinity, holds that while God is fully one, there are three Persons in the one God and Jesus is the second Person of the Trinity. Judaism does not accept that Jesus is the Son of God and considers the doctrine of the Trinity to be polytheism and a contradiction to the strict monotheism of Judaism. As a consequence of this, the shared beliefs of Judaism and Christianity stop abruptly at the Old Testament. Islam rejects the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. For the Qu'ran there is only one unforgivable sin, namely, associating other beings with God and placing them on an equal with Him. According to Muslim tradition, the Qu'ran is the infallible word of God revealed by the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad one night in Ramadan about the year 610 as he was asleep or in a trance. But the Christian Bible quotes the same Angel Gabriel as saying to Mary: \\\"And so, the child will be holy and be called Son of God\\\" (Luke 1:35). Which Gabriel is therefore telling the truth But Islam goes one step further and also professes that Jesus was never crucified. He was taken up into heaven by God after another who resembled him was killed in his place. The Christian Bible nonetheless quotes that person as saying: \\\"Father, forgive them for they know what they do\\\"! As for marriage, from early post-exile times, polygamy was generally accepted as the norm in Jewish society but in the year 1000 AD it was decreed that it was punishable by excommunication. Indeed, in his book The Bible and the Qu'ran, Jacques Jomier speculated that the polygamous law of the Qu'ran played a great part in the spread of Islam with the acceptability of divorce and the authorisation of having up to four simultaneous wives. Interestingly, it is documented that Muhammad himself had as many as ten wives. When he was 25 years old he married his first wife, a wealthy widow, Kadifah, aged 40, and his second wife and the youngest, Aisha, was six years old when he married her (Maxine Rodinson, Penguin Books, 1961). In addition, Jesus is quoted as saying that there is no marriage in heaven: \\\"At the resurrection men and women do not marry; they are like the angels in heaven\\\" (Matthew 22:30). However, the Qu'ran teaches otherwise: \\\"They (the righteous) shall recline in couches ranged in rows. To dark-eyed houris, We shall wed them\\\" (Qu'ran 52:20). All religions agree that God is Truth. But as Pilate once asked: \\\"What is truth\\\" Obviously, the world must not continually live a lie and I believe that it is destined that time will discover the truth and that one day soon we will all be one in that truth, whatever it may be!

This is a direct encouragement to the population to rely on divine intervention rather than rationality, hard work, personal and community commitment to solve our many problems. It also encourages regression to tribal politics in a society that is struggling to move past the barriers of race and religion. While Mr Carmona is entitled to his religious beliefs in his private capacity, as President of the Republic he took an oath to serve all citizens of the nation. So when he singles out a group of persons defined by their non-religiosity, who may number anywhere between 26,000 and 90,000 persons depending on how census data is interpreted, he sends a message that such people are not entitled to all the rights enshrined in the Constitution. It also raises questions as to whether an individual who was agnostic or atheist or even non-Christian, would be fairly treated by him in respect of particular appointments and decisions which fall under the authority of the President. Ironically, mere hours later in his national address, President Carmona asserted that, \\u201cEveryone is special and has a rightful place in this republic\\u201d and \\u201cThe common denominator of national dialogue must be compassion, empathy, understanding and tolerance''. This denominator he has signally failed to demonstrate in his dismissal and demonisation of non-believers. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

Justice Frank Seepersad. A DECISION is expected next month in the case involving a composer who sued the Tobago Housing Assembly (THA) after it was alleged his song was used without permission in an advertisement. The ad included pork, which he does not consume because of his religious belief. Recording artiste and performer Sean Caruth cited copyright infringement over the use of his song \\u201cThe Cook (Coal Pot)\\u201d, which he created in 2001. The matter is being heard before Justice Frank Seepersad and was called yesterday at the Tobago High Court. Caruth said there were advertisements for the 2012 Tobago Blue Food Festival with his composition \\u201cThe Cook (Coalpot)\\u201d. He said it was used as the soundtrack along with a clip displaying images of various types of food, including pork. Caruth said he does not consume pork because of religion beliefs. He said had he been contacted, he would not have agreed to associate his song with such images. It was stated that his moral rights as author of the musical works were infringed as his name was not indicated in the advertisement ad as well as his right to object to his musical work being used in connection with images of pork \\u201cwhich is contrary to (his) lifestyle and amount to derogatory action that is prejudicial to his honour and reputation.\\u201d It was stated Caruth\\u2019s performing rights were infringed upon as there was no authorization from him for his music to be included in the advertisement. Caruth\\u2019s neighbouring rights were infringed, it was stated, by the reproducing of 39 seconds of the sound recording in television and radio advertisements that ran between September 20 and October 14 2012. The advertisement was aired on one radio station over 200 times, court documents stated. It was also later on YouTube. In 2012 the co-ordinator of the THA\\u2019s event was informed the song had been used without permission and needed to be removed from television and radio advertisements. Caruth also launched a complaint with the Copyright Music Organization of Trinidad and Tobago with whom he had assigned the copyright for his musical works. The Copyright Music Organization of Trinidad and Tobago (COTT) advised the THA of the infringement and sought settlement. Caruth who said that up to March 2018 the ad was accessible on social media is seeking exemplary damages, interest and cost. The THA has submitted that it not a proper party to the proceedings and that it had no dealing with and is not liable to Caruth. It was also stated that Caruth was paid to perform at the 2013 Blue Food Festival, surrendering any claim regarding the 2012 use of the song. A decision in the matter is expected on July 23.

While people differ, one thing is common among all, they eat, drink, procreate and eventually die. Culture and religion lead different people in directions that may make one group to seem very different from another, but no matter what defines one group from another, none has been able to prevent diseases, sickness, accidents, disappointments and despair. Some people have learned over time that dancing, music, sharing with others, caring for each other and living in harmony with nature brings the human being the greatest joys. Almost every time I go to a funeral, it is the little things that one did to enhance the lives of another that is highlighted. I have never been to a funeral where family or loved ones boast about the accumulation of wealth or the amount of power one wielded. Its always to what extent we were able to positively impact the people we interacted with that determines our ultimate destiny or at the very least how people perceive our stay on earth. With this in mind I wish to challenge the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago to seek the greater good. What is wrong when as a nation we name our highest award after the Creator in Christian terms Other religions or people with different values should not be forced to accept the Trinity Cross, they can have the Order of T&T, but why eliminate our Christian history and values simply to be politically correct Why are we not insisting that our tax dollars are spent in ensuring that never again in our nations history we should be faced with a situation where our citizens are forced to sleep on chairs and on the floor in the corridors of our hospitals Why are we not opening up homes for the elderly where they can be treated with dignity Why are we not teaching our children to be tolerant of people of all cultures, races and beliefs and demonstrate the positives of loving each other Why are our aspirations evaluated by race, political party and culture rather than what is best for our nation Why is our politics divided in such a way that there are safe political seats anchored by ethnicity Trinidad and Tobago is blessed with natural resources, clean water, beautiful beaches, wonderful people and a location that protects our people from the ravages of natural disasters. In spite of these positives, however, there are people among us who are selfish, greedy, destructive, power hungry and wicked. It is because of these people that our cities and towns are dirty, our water courses are overgrown, our murder rate in among the highest per capita in the world, our system of justice has degenerated into one where street justice and revenge is replacing our courts and our children are living with a sense of hopelessness. It is up to us to face the challenges of tomorrow. We can put aside our sense of importance and silly pride and understand that we cannot stop our loved ones from getting sick or prevent our children from facing lifes hardships but we can do the best we can with the little we have. We can love God and one another and in so doing build better friendships, happier families, safer communities and ultimately a better nation.

Like other religious occasions that are celebrated in our multi-cultural society, Eid-ul-Fitr, besides being a public holiday, is recognised by most citizens, if only by their enjoyment of the culinary delights that are associated with it. Such acceptance of each other's beliefs and practices, which goes beyond the tolerance that our national watchwords expect of us, bodes well for the future of this melting pot in which dividing lines are becoming increasingly blurred. Indeed, Islam is a religion which that has historically attracted people of all ethnicities. Generally, our Muslims have been good citizens who have made, and continue to make, important contributions to the development of the country. Although they were late entrants to the education system through the establishment of primary schools from the 1950s, they have risen to the top by insisting on high standards from both staff members and pupils. They have successfully engaged in other spheres of nation-building, from the public service to private enterprise and everything in between. They have thrived in a nation that embraces all religions, to the extent that most communities today have mosques, some of them landmark architectural structures, others simple buildings. Over the past three decades or more, Muslim women in particular who have chosen to dress in their traditional garments, more so the hijab, have been accepted in both the private and public sectors. Such freedoms must make celebrating Eid more joyous. Indeed, it is now commonplace for some Muslims to host the Eid prayers in open spaces such as the grounds of the University of the West Indies. As we join with them in marking the end of another Ramadan, we cannot help but note the deadly attack in one of Islam's holiest cities, Medina in Saudi Arabia. According to news reports last Monday, the suicide-bomb attack near the Prophet's Mosque was part of a series of Ramadan-related bombings that targeted Afghanistan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, killing scores of Muslims. The Medina bombing was universally condemned across the Shia-Sunni divide. In fact, Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif, who is not normally friendly with the Saudis, said, \\u201cThere are no more red lines left for terrorists to cross. Sunnis, Shiites will both remain victims unless we stand united as one.\\u201d With the self-styled \\u201cIslamists\\u201d indiscriminately attacking innocent people across the world, Trinidad and Tobago's Muslims should see it as their duty to expose any would-be terrorists who may pose threats to this country. If the Prophet's Mosque in Medina is not sacrosanct to such diabolical minds, then surely T&T is vulnerable. Eid is as auspicious an occasion as any for us to vow to unite against terrorism.

What made Ali such a special individual It was his faith in Allah and the philosophy of Islam to which he subscribed that he stamped his name Muhammad Ali; a name which he took from the renowned translator of the Holy Qur'an, Maulaana Muhammad Ali, of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Anjuman, whose translation and commentaries influenced his life and the members of the Nation of Islam founded by Elijah Muhammad. The pure Islam, the religion of peace to which he subscribed, rejected the notion of the jihad of violence that is evident today in the Muslim world. It is this strong belief in non-violence, promoted in Islam only by the Ahmadiyya Movement and for which it has been ostracised, that made him refuse to be drafted into the military as he stood in principle to defy the mighty America. Today, America and the world stand in admiration of the principles which he espoused. He practised Islam in its purity, with humility, cha\\u00adrity, love and goodwill to all people. His funeral service reflected his philosophy that Islam is a religion of peace, free from violence. It recognises that all forms of religion emanate from the same creator, and teaches us that \\u201cmankind is a single nation\\u201d (Qur'an 2:213). \\u201cQaloo inna lillahi wa inna illihi raajeeon\\u201d \\u201cSay, surely we are Allah's and to Him is our eventual return.\\u201d IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night.

International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

In his message, Rowley noted that Spiritual and Shouter Baptists have overcome many challenges to be allowed the right to freely practise their religion. Imagine being forbidden to freely congregate for prayer and worship or being arrested for practising your religion. Picture being ridiculed, scorned and persecuted for your beliefs and having to flee to the hills, mountains and remote areas to escape the law, which prohibited your faith, Rowley said in a news release. That is what Spiritual/Shouter Baptists endured here in Trinidad and Tobago for decades. Rowley said, the religion, which is indigenous to T&T, has now spread to other islands and thousands of people are proud to call themselves Spiritual/Shouter Baptists. Far from the days when they were considered outlaws, the faith is now recognised for its positive contributions to our society, he said. However, Rowley said, steps must be taken to ensure the history of the Spiritual/Shouter Baptist is preserved as there is currently no repository of the history of the indigenous religion. The State must also partner with the church to help alleviate some of the social ills facing the society, he said. As we join our Spiritual Baptist brothers and sisters in celebrating Baptist Liberation Day, we use this opportunity to hold them up as an example of perseverance, persistence, strength and resilience. They have demonstrated that even the darkest hour of the night will eventually have to give way to the suns light. They understood, as we must now understand, that no challenge is insurmountable and we must always hold out hope for a better life and stay focused on working towards it, he said. Acting President Reziah Ahmed also extended greetings to the Baptist community in a news release yesterday. Today we join with our neighbours, our nations men and women and with our children to celebrate the historical occasion of the Repeal of an article of Lawthe Prohibition Ordinance of 1917, which, for many decades constituted oppression to our Shouter Baptist community, said Ahmed. It is a signal reminder of how men and women are the possessors of hearts and minds that have capacity for injustice, intolerance, and persecution of innocent people. Ahmed urged citizens to not take their freedoms for granted. Let us be grateful for our freedoms, and let us work to safeguard these freedoms, not only for ourselves, but let us leverage the communications platforms to extend our reach, beyond our shores, for the world is indeed a global village, she said. Indeed, as we celebrate this day of remembrance, let us uphold the great values of brotherhood and sisterhood and may we live in peace and harmony. Let us embrace our future with enthusiasm, hope and compassion and let us be forever reminded that it is in the capacity for love that man finds peace of mind.

You see, while there are places where facts and logic are essential to a good argument, Trinidad and Tobago isn't one of them. Instead, the individuals who get listened to in this place are usually those who present the most inane arguments as though they are gems of profound wisdom. Take medical doctor Courtenay Bartholomew, whom many people respect as a leading scientist. (Not me, eh, but people.) In his Express column of January 13, Bartholomew asserted that \\\"There can be no conflict between science and religion since both are supposed to deal with the truth, and it is written that God is truth.\\\" Now you may have encountered Christians who insist the Bible is true and, when you ask them how they know that, they answer, \\\"It say so in the Bible.\\\" You can't tell such people that they're committing a tautology, because they might report you to the police for using obscene language (and the police would believe them). Yet here we have a highly educated man also being totally tautological. (Do not attempt to say this three times fast.) Consider: if I told you that Prof Bartholomew was a zombie robot from the planet Karklebon, would you believe me just because I claimed I always speak the truth No, you'd want hard evidence, such as film footage of him eating somebody's brains while getting an oil change. This is the difference between the truths of religion and the truths of science. Science backs up its claims with experimental and observational data, tied together by logical explanations. Religion, on the other hand, proclaims truth on the basis of authority (\\\"God say so\\\"). And every religion has beliefs which are demonstrably wrong, in areas ranging from cosmology, biology, geography and history. In respect to this last discipline, another egregious example of false argument was provided on January 7 by Maha Sabha leader Sat Maharaj. In his ongoing quest to prove the perfection of ancient Indian society (the Hindu portion, that is), Maharaj asserted in a Trinidad Guardian column that pre-20th century India had no poverty, citing an 1835 address by Lord Macaulay to the British Parliament. \\\"Macaulay said he had travelled across the length and breadth of India and had not come across a person who is a beggar or who is a thief,\\\" wrote Maharaj. Now although Maharaj doesn't have a visible sense of humour, he clearly can't be serious. Anyone who genuinely wanted to argue whether 19th India was poor or not wouldn't rely on a selective account, especially when there are many other travellers who recorded quite different observations to Macaulay's. A better device is the Gross Domestic Product. According to figures compiled by the quantitative economist Angus Maddison, India's GDP per head in 1820 was $533, as compare to Britain's $1,243. But even that doesn't give a true picture since, thanks to the caste system, inequality was much greater in India than in Britain. However, the best measure of a country's poverty is a biological one: height. This is because better nutrition increases a population's average stature. Records show that in the 1840s, Indians recruited for indentured labour in Mauritius were 161-163 centimetres tall, as compared to English soldiers, who were 169 cms: and good statistics trumps anecdotes every time. January's dullest gem however, was provided on the 15th by economist Indera Sagewan-Alli, a former Opposition MP and regular guest commentator on TV talkshows. In an Express column headlined \\\"Power and political choices\\\", she wrote: \\\"According to a founding leader of the Caribbean Raja Yoga Movement, Sister Mohini, we each have the power to determine the perspective (positive or negative) we bring to the New Year and, indeed, to our lives.\\\" You'd think an economist would be more concerned with how resource allocation, incentives, and productivity impact on people's lives. But no. Instead, says Sagewan-Alli, \\\"If we choose success, immediately we assign power modules the task of defining actions that will facilitate success. All the forces of the universe then conspire with us to make success happen.\\\" And the proof of this amazing assertion Sagewan-Alli had set herself the goal of not finishing last in a 5K run. \\\"The sense of accomplishment, the surge of self-belief as I crossed the finishing line ahead of many was indescribable. But most important, it confirmed the theory that applying willpower to a task brings success.\\\" She didn't say, however, why the universe preferred everyone who had finished ahead of her. These are individuals whose opinions carry some weight in the society, with one of them sitting on the boards of several primary and secondary schools. So next time you get in an argument about why T&T is so backward...just forget it. kbaldeosingh@hotmail.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Pastor Lacaille always hailed out to my parents when passing our home on Lower Bushe Street and, almost invariably, came in to chat with them. Thus from the time I was a toddler to young adulthood, I was able to observe this gentleman at close quarters. This Baptist leader epitomised what being a Christian is all about. He was a very polite, soft-spoken individual who possessed the virtues of charity, humility and compassion for his fellow man, very slow to anger, with a passionate belief in his creator, never one to speak ill of another and ever willing to lend an ear and give sound advice. I consider it a great privilege and honour to have known this pious member of the Shouter Baptist following, who was persecuted and prosecuted for practising his religion but never wavered an iota from his convictions and beliefs.

Alas, many words to the wise have not been sufficient. People's National Movement (PNM) leader Prime Minister Patrick Manning in one evening managed to invoke both bogeys: first, byusing the term\\\"her own kind\\\" in reference to Kamla Persad-Bissessar; and then by warning Christians to be wary of United National Congress (UNC) coalitionmember Makandal Daaga because of the alleged desecration of the Roman Catholic cathedral 40 years ago. This latter allegation, for lacking validity,is likely only to backfire, andfor various reasons. First, although Mr Manning has been serving up \\\"political education\\\" in history on the PNM platform, his recounting of that 1970 episode entails a misstating of fairly well known events.For no suchdesecration occurred. The RC Church, whose cathedral demonstrators, including Mr Daaga, had entered, took no such offence.Indeed, the Catholic archbishop at the time, Anthony Pantin, had expressed sympathyfor the goals and grievances of the Black Power movementof whichMr Daaga was a leader. Fr Gerry Pantin founded the Catholic social-action organisation, Servol, as a direct result of the uprising. Mr Manning is strainingretroactively tomake an artificial mountain out of what is really a historical molehill. The PNM leaderis being more than a little disingenuous in calling for Mr Daaga to issue a \\\"letter of comfort\\\" to Catholics and Christians. More importantly, though, this blatant attempt to use religion can exacerbate divisions in the society, and indeed might be interpreted as a subtle degradation of religious mores as well. On their platform, some UNC coalition speakers have themselves beenusing religious belief to further their political fortunes,asserting that God is responsible for calling this election, that God wants Patrick Manning removed, and so on. A country which comprises several different religions and races can only become a nation when its various groups share common goals, values and aspirations. When politicians attempt to play different constituencies against one another, this process is hampered in ways which harm all citizens, even if some politicians gain short-term benefits from such divisions. Fortunately,more and morepeoplereceive racially coded language (\\\"her own kind'')and religious appeals with scepticism, even disdain. Addressing a World Press Freedom Day workshop last Monday, former media head Ken Gordon said, \\\"If we collectively condemn all who return to the old racial bogeys, and discard those who seek to keep us apart, they will get the message.\\\" We hope they do.

Throughout a world of diversity and conflicts, in spite of its disasters and its challenges, and even in countries that have been much secularised and commercialised, today the world once again celebrates the birth of Christ. Some may dismiss the importance of the day, but surely the deep and lasting messages of the event must continue to offer some hope for humanity. What may these messages be Although many will already be aware of them, it is perhaps worth revisiting some. One is that common feeling of communion with others, that feeling of belonging to family, community and country. Another, certainly, is that upwelling of compassion for others, especially the lonely and the unfortunate. And, perhaps, it's all associated with that transition from the dying old year to the new. But surely the greatest message is simply one of hope, for without hope, and belief in the basic goodness of man, all would be lost and life would have little meaning. Let us not delude ourselves. There may be many seasonal distractions and considerable commercialisation, and some inevitable personal tragedies. But the core message of Christmas cannot be one of mindless merriment, but only one of hope and charity. This year, despite the negatives we have seen, citizens of all walks of life came together as one people to fulfill the hope of a mother, the hope for the chance of life for her seriously stricken child, Hanna Lendor. The gesture manifested the deep spirit of giving that is part of Christmas, exemplified in the story of the three wise men bearing gifts for the Christ child. Disorders of the wider world necessarily cause disquiet and alarm, not only for the victims of natural disasters but also for the innocent victims of civil strife, conflict and terror. What survives, however, is that deep belief and trust in the goodness of humanity that expresses a common hope, that always rises to the trials of lifepeace and goodwill to all. The Express and its staff at this time join in extending our best wishes to all readers and their families. May we also in some pause, and some reflection on the message of Christmas, embracing the prevailing spirit of peace and goodwill, in confident assurance that together we can build a future.

Surely the pontiff and his advisers will have been aware of the reactions to the statement. And we are even more puzzled at the substance of the statement. Religions are generally conservative human associations with an accepted body of beliefs and rituals. What is notable about Christianity is that while it accepts both Old and New Testaments as the word of God, the testaments differ in their references to homosexuality. The Old Testament prescribes extremely barbaric punishments for the phenomenon while the New Testamentassuredly Christ's messagemakes little mention of it. Needless to say a not inconsiderable component of Christianity, the so-called gay and lesbian Christian community, publicly denounced the statement. And we suspect that many others will share their view. But what is also equally puzzling is that the Vatican, unlike many of the fundamentalist Christian churches, has progressively adopted a more liberal position on such burning issues as capital punishment and evolution. The science of animal behaviour has shown without doubt that homosexuality is relatively common especially among social birds and mammals, including the apes with which we share much of our DNA. Indeed, our closest cousin, the chimpanzeewith which we share 98.4 of our DNAdisplays the same general range of sexual relationships and activities as does the human species. So although science has not yet fully unravelled a genetic basis of human sexual orientation in humans, it seems highly probable that this will become known in time. The pontiff states that humanity needed to listen to the \\\"language of creation \\\" that supposedly defines the intended roles of man and woman, claiming that any union of two persons other than as a man and woman, husband and wife, presumably unified by a religious ceremony, was a \\\"destruction of God's work\\\". Anything else is self-destruction. The cynic might equally well argue that celibacy is contrary to natural law, preventing the natural flow of genes, the essence of life, from one generation to another. Today's world has changed radically from those days when the Church was part and parcel of the ruling classes and determined the norms of acceptable behaviour. In a functioning modern democracy religion has been guaranteed its specific place, in the same way that the individual man or woman is guaranteed basic human rights.

Its aim is to create a positive discourse on the Hindu view on a topic, by hosting a Queering Hinduism (the alternative Hindu discourse on alternative lifestyles seminar.The seminar, titled Queering Hinduism -the alternative Hindu discourse on alternative lifestyles was held last month at the National Council of Indian Culture (NCIC) Nagar in Chaguanas. It featured three speakers and their view of Hinduism regarding alternative or queer lifestyles. The conference focused on issues involving the LGBT (Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/ Transgender) community.Founding director of CIS, lecturer at the University of the West Indies (UWI) and NCIC founding youth arm chair, Dr. Arvind Singh gave his presentation entitled, LGBTH (where the H stood for Hindu).Singh highlighted the Hindu shruti-smriti paradigm of knowledge in which spirituality in the quest for the supreme truth is not concerned in the least with gender and sexuality.Singh drew from scriptural sources to show that in Hinduism, sexuality was seen as fluid and natural in all its manifestations.He said, The continued denial of rights is categorically UN-HINDU and privileges, like the trinity cross perhaps, the beliefs of some religious communities over others, not to mention over the fundamental rights of people.Krystal Ghisyawan, whose current research is focused on loving lesbian women in Trinidad and their desire for safety within their families, country and religion, spoke about the real challenges same sex loving women face trying to reconcile their sexuality with their religion and family life. She explained that they (lesbian women) often turn to a more personal, individual, less institutional form of the faith.Ghisyawan presentation covered, \\\"the loved experience of same sex loving Hindu women (whom she interviewed for her PhD thesis.) She said: Most of them felt as though there was pressure in the Hindu community to be an ideal model of femininity - heterosexual and submissive. I also referenced the myths within the religion that they identified with to make sense of their sexual orientation, such as the Ardhanareeshwar (half woman God) which combined masculinity and femininity in one body.

Take the word pastor, for example. In the language it may mean a priest, minister, elder or layperson, more often male, of one of the Christian faiths exercising some degree of spiritual or even social-behavioural influence over a group or congregation. Other cultures have different names for such leadership of different faiths, which we need not consider here, except that they exercise some degree of control over the group. The word may also mean a shepherd or one who herds or generally manages a flock of sheep for their wool and flesh, the words shepherd? and pastor often being used interchangeably, sharing a common theme of the individual herding/managing/controlling a group. The words plastic and plasticity? on the other hand have a wider range of meanings around a central theme of the property of being formless and amorphous and being moulded by diverse processes into distinct shapes or even functions. The word plastic is widely used in everyday life and one of its meanings is not unsurprisingly impressionable and easily influenced. Also, as we learn from biology and, incidentally, archaeology and history, that at birth a newborn human will have the potential to develop into an adult consistent partly with his or her genetic programming, and largely by the nurturing and conditioning of the immediate family, its social, cultural and political environment. Given the diversity of human cultures it is inevitable that the species must necessarily have a considerable degree of plasticity in contrast to many other animals that are prisoners of their genes. If one is born into one morph of a particular faith the odds are you will continue in it to some degree, although some may drift away or sever adherence. Although many animals, particularly mammals, have differing capabilities of learning, the human species with its large brain must obviously have unusual learning ability and consequently conditioning potential. While many mammals have genetically determined social structures involving herding behaviour, humans can hardly be described as a naturally herding species, being genetically somewhere between solitary and social, displaying extreme plasticity of social behaviour. This plasticity gives us language and writing, art and music, agriculture and food production, social, political and economic development, science in all its forms, clashes of cultures, histories of all its recent populations, and of course religion or religions. When we consider religion we tend to concentrate more on the body of beliefs about human life, ways and rituals, moral codes, religious laws, possibly also life about us, the nature of the planet and solar system, and the wider universe, and the cause or causes of material existence, possibly created by some sort of supernatural being or beings. We rarely consider origins or that religions might be mental states, properties of human minds and byproducts of their social conditioning. Perhaps, also, we often seem not to understand that religions in all their manifestations are closely interwoven with virtually all human activities or behaviour, language, war, commerce, politics, conquest, history, philosophy, the arts, disasters, disease, physical and economic development, environmental decay and slavery and even genocide. All too often, however, we seem to shy away from considering the origins of religions, mostly I imagine, in order to avoid offence. As I have suggested above, while we are not a naturally herding species our plasticity favours a considerable measure of herding behaviour, with all manner of pastors leading and controlling different groups, which in time achieve critical mass and a following. Put another way, it might be suggested that religion is more an expression of a human condition of a particular people at a particular time than an expression of ultimate reality, an expression that had some adaptive value, like speech and later writing, in binding primitive groups or super family groups of humans, favouring development of cultures, but which would later be a divisive force separating cultures. Writer Raymond Ramcharitar so aptly sees this condition as the malleability of human nature. In other words all religions could really be abstractions of the human mind randomly guided by cultural conditioning. Perhaps the best demonstration of religious plasticity is to be found in the United States, with its history of colonisation, conquest and enslavement. There are perhaps about 150 recognisable morphs of Christianity all sharing a small common core of beliefs, but with each grouping having a distinctive flavouring of binding rituals, from the rigid bureaucratic types, the mega churches, to the individual television performances, many competing for market share, with some seeking political power, and not a few offering healings on demand, gimmicks and prosperity. For survival they all rely on the financial contributions or tithes from their individual groupings, and their messages and promises. There are also other religions in that country; their numbers are much smaller but their basic methods may be comparable. Whether pastor or shepherd, the leadership, like political leadership, thrives insofar as it is able to herd its followers usually with props and promises.

A little push of any one may result in an entirely unpredictable outcome, hence the name \\\"chaos\\\". The most popular imagery, and I emphasise the word imagery, is of the connectivity of a butterfly flitting its wings in the depths of the Amazon rainforest leading to a devastating typhoon in the Pacific Ocean. It is largely a mathematical construct that may be projected into the real world. The remarkable thing about the construct is that any system arising from a tiny push while apparently chaotic may display its own highly ordered structure. Although well-intentioned the Integrity in Public Life Act became chaotic for two reasons the net of persons affected was much widened, and, the Commission, despite its many failings and self-inflicted wounds, it was never provided with the human and other resources to meet its responsibilities. And it may become even more chaotic as it reacts to external pressures such as a little push from Dr Rowley. Readers of this column may very well question the connection of abstract theory and the now rather thorny issue of conflicts of interest. Each of us will have a range of interests. Institutions, even churches, may also have ranges of interests. A conflict may arise where the individual or institution, in their normal activities, has an interest that, if pursued, may possibly influence their pursuit of another interest that might lead to some sort of impropriety or corruption. An insurance claims assessor, for example, does not evaluate claims for a relative's property, nor does an attorney represent both sides of a conflict between parties. The important point to note is that most people and institutions are able to recognise such conflicts and eliminate them in different ways before they metamorphose from possible to real conflict, and chaos. The ways in which conflicts of interest may be eliminated vary but the common approaches at the personal level may be either simple avoidance, or open disclosure of interest, or recusal from the particular conflict or third party resolution. At public and professional levels special codes of practice may be developed informing parties of what is expected of them. It is not uncommon in our Parliament for example for individuals to state an interest but contribute to a debate on the matter. As has been emphasised by both Martin Daly and Dana Seetahal, who addressed the broad issue as opposed to giving legal opinions, both clearly defined the boundaries of the envelope of the power of the Commission. Now that the Integrity Commission has created the precedent of commenting publicly on a matter \\\"actively in the public sphere\\\" it will be much challenged even if or when it considers the matter of the Lighthouse of the Lord Jesus Christ Church, a matter even more hyperactive in the public sphere. Religion is and has been a powerful, emotive, violent and often divisive influence in human affairs, historically much involved in conflicts of one kind or another, often exercising power over others, while having no monopoly on morality. And in this country, although in theory a secular state where religion plays mainly a ritual role in the affairs of the State, the Constitution does nevertheless guarantee freedom of conscience and religious belief and observance. Thus any investigation of any impropriety or corruption of any church, regardless of the size of its congregations or body of beliefs and rituals is bound to be contentious. Why should this be so Potential conflicts of interest! Anyone party to investigating the matter who happens to be seen to be in a leadership position of the same religious persuasion, or of the same family of beliefs, or for that matter a member of any religion, will see the immediate conflict. I would think also that there would be a similar conflict for any avowed atheist. The believers, especially those closest to that particular brand, might simply go overboard in softening the approach while the atheists might be rather heavy handed. Possibly only rational agnostics might be able to look into the matter objectively. The Commission is conducting and enquiry into the Guanapo church matter, hopefully in its own deliberate judgement and not on any directive from the executive and not on the basis of it being \\\"actively in the public sphere\\\". While the Commission has considerable powers of investigation it is procedurally bound by Section 34 at the end of which if it suspects an offence has been committed it can do no more than report to the Director of Public Prosecutions \\\"who may take such actions as he thinks appropriate\\\"! The Chairman with his admission of pastorship of a church must therefore now recuse himself from any involvement in the Guanapo chaos. Moreover the Chairman must avoid expressing personal opinions that may be misconstrued as being that of the Integrity Commission.

In my first article, which appeared in the Sunday Express of August 28, 1994, I urged among other things that \\\"the Trinity Cross award be dropped in favour of an award of truly national scope. The words 'Trinity' and 'Cross' carry obvious connotations of religion; they represent the very essence of Christianity. Even if 70 per cent of the population is Christian, ours is a secular society, where every creed is said to find an equal place. Therefore, logically, should any national award, and especially our highest award, convey any hint of emphasis on, or even leaning towards, this religion or that, or, indeed, carry any religious coloration at all Especially in a country as touchy as this one is on race and, to a lesser extent, religion, does this advance the cause of national unity\\\" I repeated this position in another Express article six years later, in August 2000. I added that I considered the whole national award system grievously defective, and that I would never accept any award under it. Nearly six years after that, in June 2006, I wrote this: \\\"For me, the most worrying aspect of the (Trinity Cross) debate has been the continuing subtext of religion, race and party politics in the comments of those favouring the preservation of the current top award. It is a dangerous cocktail. \\\"Where religion is concerned, you would think that many Christians' interpretation of Christianity is for them indisputably more important than anyone else's, and more valid than any commitment to constructing an equitable society within the framework of the country's Constitution and declared aspirations. \\\"Instead, it has largely been a question of asserting the primacy of Christianityin a secular state, mind youand a conviction that those 'devious' Hindus, led by Sat Maharaj, have in fact been carrying out their long-held plan to undermine the faith and eventually topple it. The heathens would then triumph, and a wrathful Christian God would, for our sins, unleash fire and brimstone and devastating floods upon our formerly peaceful, demon-free, Christian land (thus indiscriminately liquidating both Christian and heathen alike). \\\"But it isn't only Hinduism that threatens (Islam isn't spoken about too much, but that is perhaps because Muslims are fewer in number, and less voluble than Sat). Dem peoplethat is how, in a projected Vision 2020 world, many of us still see our fellow citizens: 'dem people', or worseare also 'Indians', and everyone knows you can't trust 'Indians'. \\\"They aren't going to stop at causing the cross to go; they will next move to change the country's name. That name (ask some of our 'historians') is 'Trinidad', and Trinidad is a country of which Tobagolike, say, Brasso Piedra or Rampanalgasis a part, and consequently without a separate identity in what we love to call, erroneously, our 'twin-island republic'. And, horrors, all dem 'Indians', even the Christian ones, are UNC. Never mind the current schisms in the party; they want to take over.\\\" I concluded: \\\"If over the years I have set my face like flint against an award with religious connotations, why do you think this is so Because I am anti-religious, or at least anti-Christian Because I prefer 'Indians' to black people Because I am a secret UNCite Because I am so gullible I've allowed myself to be led astray by 'dem people' Or is it because I wish to see us work towards a society in which every creed and race can one day genuinely find an equal place And in which much more energy is exerted on nation-building than on fevered exaltation of one's racial, ethnic, religious or political affiliations, beliefs and prejudices\\\" The Trinity Cross has now been replaced as the highest, or any, national award. Despite this, the Maha Sabha, the Islamic Relief Centre and others (\\\"the appellants\\\") approached the Privy Council (PC) on the constitutionality of the 1969 Letters Patent establishing the society of honour called the Order of Trinity, the highest rank of which was the Trinity Cross. In its judgment delivered last April 28, the PC said that the appellants were \\\"entitled to a declaration that creation of the Trinity Crossbreached their right to equality under section 4(b), their right to equality of treatment under section 4(d) and their right to freedom of conscience and belief under section 4(h) of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago 1976. Their Lordships will allow the appeal and make a declaration to that effect.\\\" I congratulate the appellants on their perseverance and eventual success (due in no small measure to the forensic skills of Sir Fenton Ramsahoye), but I am embarrassed that matters had to reach the point of having our highest courta foreign courtdeclare our former highest national award unconstitutional. We should all be embarrassed, and ashamed of the obstinacy that too many of us have displayed, and continue to display, in not recognising as equals a large proportion of our countrymen and women. At least I won't have to write anything on the subject in 2012. But the national award system as a whole, even with the departure of the Trinity Cross, is still defective.

Delivering greetings to the Baptist community in a news release yesterday, on the eve of Spiritual Shouter Baptist Day, Persad-Bissessar noted the significance of todays holiday, saying it was on March 30, 1951 that the Shouters Prohibition Ordinance of 1917 was repealed, allowing Spiritual/Shouter Baptists to worship and practise their faith openly without discrimination and repression. Like all others, this faith community enjoys protection under Trinidad and Tobagos 1976 Republican Constitution, which guarantees all citizens, freedom of conscience and religious belief and observance, said the Prime Minister. Persad-Bissessar said although the origins of the Spiritual/Shouter Baptist faith in Trinidad and Tobago can be traced to foreign countries, it has evolved over time to become a unique, indigenous religion. It has managed to fuse the spontaneity and rhythms of Africa with the restrained, traditional tenets of Christianity to produce a religion that is vibrant, expressive and dynamic. Today, the Spiritual Shouter Baptist Community constitutes a most colourful and vibrant part of our countrys religious mosaic. Indeed, many of ours sons and daughters of this faith are highly respected, not only among their own, but in the wider society. Many of them are professionals who hold substantive positions in both the public and private sectors. The Spiritual Shouter Baptist Community also plays a critical role in the education of our nations children by proudly managing their very own St Barbaras Spiritual Shouter Baptist Primary School in Maloney. Trinidad and Tobago can easily be described as the mecca for the Shouter Baptist movement in the Caribbean, she said.

This is a dangerous time for us. Fundamental rights are under attack, as is the Judiciary, the primary arbiter of the extent of those rights. As my esteemed colleague, Selwyn Ryan, wrote in this newspaper two Sundays ago: \\\"What we are witnessing is an unconcealed attempt at comprehensive executive aggrandisement.\\\" I would add that the attempt is intended to acquire power to whatever extent is necessary in order to mow down anything and smear anyone interfering with the executive aggrandisement plan. The title of this column is inspired by something written by Maureen Dowd in the New York Times earlier this month, in which she wrote about how ideals \\\"collide with harsh reality\\\" and the dangers of excessive compromise of inspiring objectives. She was analysing the apparent wavering of Barack Obama, whose election to the office of President of the United States initially set the world on fire. The focus of Maureen Dowd's column to which I refer was concern that President Obama's charisma might be diluted by his constantly reaching for common ground. She quotes the former President of the Czech Republic who warned that, \\\"With minor compromises start the big and dangerous ones, the real problems.\\\" Ms Dowd comments that, one must be careful not to compromise so much that, \\\"ideals get blurred out of recognition\\\". You can \\\"get smudged if too much is fudged\\\". This Government has been in a constant state of denial that violent crime is a serious problem for Trinidad and Tobago. It has consistently fudged dealing with the problem, often not even acknowledging that there is one. Unfortunately for us the fudging has taken us way past merely being smudged. We are experiencing grief in abundance. The population is traumatised, in fear of opening our doors or going out on routine business or for pleasure. There is no place that cannot be reached with impunity by the violent criminal element whenever they feel like it. The fudging of the crime problem is backed up by a belief that the Christian God is on the side of the Government and will deliver its Ministers from evil and, perhaps, the rest of us ordinary mortals will receive the collateral benefit of our delivery from evil. There are obvious practical difficulties in mixing up politics and religion. It is plainly offensive in a plural society for any public official to lay claim to knowledge of who is the true God. The Constitution guarantees freedom of worship and we sing that there is an equal place for every creed and race. However, in view of the claim of this Government that it is \\\"drunk on God\\\", (a blasphemy if I ever heard one), the difficulty of mixing politics and religion that concerns me most at the moment is the effect which reliance on religious belief has on the mind of the politician. In a lecture given in 1932, Freud, the psycho-analyst, compared and contrasted the roles of philosophy, science and religion and said of the effect of religion on men and women that: \\\"It assures them of protection and final happiness amid the changing vicissitudes of life, and guides their thoughts and actions by means of precepts which are backed by the whole force of its authority.\\\" Put simply, a person armed with an assurance that everything will be all right does not need to embrace philosophy or science or to heed the views of others in an attempt to consider \\\"how to avoid certain dangers or to combat many sufferings\\\". Likewise it would seem to those politicians with God on their side that there is no need for meaningful democracy because the wishes of other people cannot trump the certainty of the religious revelation. Consequently, checks and balances on executive power are a nuisance and an impediment to implementation of the revelation. Living in the midst of the misuse of religious fervour to gloss over bad politics and bad governance compels me, by contrast to many of President Obama's critics, to view his attempts to find common ground with sympathetic relief. I am comforted that the most powerful democratically elected official should first seek as far as possible to reconcile conflicting views on healthcare and wars being fought abroad, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, before attempting to impose his will on the population who elected him. The fact is we badly need a whole range of measures likely to bring peace and reconciliation in this small and divided nation of ours. We have fudged and smudged our path to a civilised quality of life. We have a huge amount of work to do to get ourselves off the road that is sign posted materialism only, and back on the road that is sign posted civilisation. The latter road is a broad and inclusive avenue, the former road is a dead-end, pun intended, in view of our disproportionate number of murdered dead.

Imam Mohammed said as president of the IRO, representing different religious beliefs, \\\"I cannot tell members what to do, but we can certainly tell them how we feel.\\\" He said, \\\"Catholics come together on Ash Wednesday, put on ashes to cleanse themselves and ask for forgiveness for what they have done. They fast and pray for some time, and then they go back and do the usual thing for the rest of the year.

Today I'll look at another recent study of religion in T&T, this one by an American anthropologist, Keith McNeal. It has the usual long, academic type of title: Trance and Modernity in the Southern Caribbean: African and Indian Popular Religions in Trinidad and Tobago. This book is a comparative study of the Orisha or Shango religion, and the Shakti Puja traditionthe worship of Kali and associated deities in modern Trinidadian Kali temples. It is historical ethnography: it combines historical research based on documentary evidence, with detailed descriptions of present-day practices based on actual observation and even participation (McNeal did most of this \\\"field work\\\" in 1999-2000). These two religious traditions are what McNeal calls \\\"subaltern\\\": both were historically despised and marginalised in colonial Trinidad, a situation which still prevails even today, though to a far lesser extent especially in the case of the Orisha faith. Derived from origins in West Africa and North and South India respectively, McNeal shows that they have evolved in remarkably similar ways, both adapting and changing in response to similar forces in colonial and post-colonial society. Because this is an academic book, there is a lot of theoretical discussion which is densely written and difficult; but the heart of the book for non-academic readers will probably be the chapters that present the \\\"ethnographical\\\" descriptions of the two religions, their ritual practices, their beliefs, their \\\"pantheons\\\" (deities). The fascinating material is enriched by striking photographs by the author of what he saw at Kali temples and Orisha yards (taken and published with permission, of course!) The core of McNeal's project is to show how similar the ritual practices and belief systems of the two religions are, though he never down-plays the obvious differences. Both are examples of what he calls \\\"ecstatic worship\\\": the central religious ritual involves persons falling into a trance (\\\"catching the power\\\") and \\\"manifesting\\\" a particular deity. During these manifestationsa term McNeal prefers to the more commonly used \\\"possession\\\"the \\\"medium\\\" counsels, rebukes, advises and (especially in the Kali temples) tries to heal those who have come to the service. Of course the manifesting deities are different: Kali and associated deities of mainly Indian derivation as against the Orisha pantheon of Yoruba origins. But the concepts behind the rituals of trance, manifestation and medium performance, McNeal shows, are strikingly similar. Each faith stresses a kind of mystical, cosmic energy which makes the trance and manifestation of the deities possible: Shakti in the Kali worship, which is often known as Shakti Puja, Ash in the Orisha. In addition, the ritual sacrifice to the deities of animals, goats and chickens, has historically been an essential part of worship services in both faiths, though not all Orisha \\\"feasts\\\" involve such sacrifices, and many modern Kali temples don't practice \\\"blood sacrifice\\\" at all. The similarity between the two faiths, therefore, is fundamental, having to do with core religious concepts and rituals. It's not just the fact that many African-Trinidadians attend Kali temples, and some Indo-Trinidadians are involved in the Orisha faith. It's not just that there are \\\"Indian\\\" deities who manifest in Orisha ritualsOsain is also known as \\\"Indian Man\\\", Ogun may manifest as Hanuman or Mahabil, Oshun has recently shown a link with Ganga Mata and Mother Lakshmi. The similarity has to do with deep spiritual conceptsoften called a \\\"cosmology\\\"and the ritual practices at the heart of both faiths. Shakti Puja or Kali worship, of course, is rooted in traditions of Hinduism originating in both North and South India which were brought here by the indentured immigrants in the 19th century. It was revived and transformed by influences brought from Guyana after national Independence, and the modern Kali temples were established from the late 1970s on. McNeal gives a detailed account of both the colonial practices which were \\\"precursors\\\" or fore-runners to the modern Kali worship, and the individuals, Guyanese and local, who pioneered the present-day movement. Although Shakti Puja is part of Hinduism, the modern movement has not been warmly received by mainstream, orthodox, \\\"Sanatanist\\\" Hinduism. It is generally frowned on as being a more \\\"primitive\\\", backward, \\\"low\\\" form of the faith. In this sense, the marginalisation endured by Kali worship in colonial times has continuedbut now it is the mainstream Hindu bodies, rather than the State, doing the marginalising. By contrast, as McNeal shows, the Orisha movement has been embraced warmly by many persons who are not the traditional, grassroots adherents of the faith, but who see in it a vitally \\\"African\\\" religion which can help redeem and recover their African identity. They have tended in recent times to lead a movement to \\\"purify\\\" the faith by eliminating the Christian (and Hindu) elements which have been part of it since the 19th century, and by emphasizing its Yoruba origins. No surprise that this effort has not been without its tensions and controversies. McNeal's richly detailed and always sympathetic study should help us to see how complex and fascinating our cultural and religious scene really is.

The sarcasm behind the statement elicited general laughter but National Security Minister Jack Warner, to whom the remark was no doubt directed, wore a cheerless expression. Warner had stated in a letter to Surujdeo Mangaroo, Public Relations Officer of the National Council of Indian Culture (NCIC) , that he had stayed away from the opening of Divali Nagar because of the presence of Rowley. Rowley said in Parliament yesterday that the country was fortunate because it had different cultures. \\\"At times like these it is the coming together and sharing of what the communities have brought and made Trinidad and Tobago's own that should cause us to understand our place in the world. \\\"In the area of peaceful coexistence, multicultural, multireligious, multiethnic communities living together and sharing experiences, working together to build a nation, there is nowhere else in the world where a better example could be found than Trinidad and Tobago, notwithstanding the best efforts of some who may not fully appreciate what we have accomplished in the short life of our country,\\\" he stated. Rowley said the triumph of light over darkness was something accepted by all religions in the world and Divali represented that. He said in this country, there were celebrations, such as Christmas and Divali, which transcended the communities for which they came. Minister of Transport Chandresh Sharma said said he was happy that in this 50th anniversary of Independence, the country stood strong as a nation in its commitment to religious freedom and diversity. \\\"Each Member of Parliament here has in his or her heart the best for Trinidad and Tobago. It is in this vein that we sit here every week and conduct a respectful debate on the issues affecting Trinidad and Tobago. We may have differing opinions on how we reach the same goal but we do have one goala better Trinidad and Tobago for all of us for the next 50 years,\\\" he said to loud desk thumping on both sides. He said the observance of Divali was testimony to the diverse cultural traditions of the country. \\\"It makes all of us very proud to know the high regard which we hold and demonstrate for each other's beliefs and customs,\\\" he said.

Those were the words of Bishop Mural Dillon, as he spoke during Spiritual Shouter Baptist Liberation Day celebrations in Tobago yesterday. Dillon said Trinidad and Tobago gave birth to three children during slavery and, in the post-slavery era today, two of them are national treasures and the other is treated like a bastard. These \\u201cchildren\\u201d are the steelband, calypso and the Spiritual Shouter Baptist religion. \\u201cThe world recognises steelband and calypso as natural treasures of Trinidad and Tobago...although the Spiritual Shouter Baptist religion has spread throughout the Caribbean and to some international countries, we are still treated like a bastard child in our own birthplace,\\u201d Dillon said. However, one of the highlights of yesterday's celebrations was the fact that the foundation for the proposed building for the Spiritual Baptist Educational Complex has started, at a cost of $600,000. Since 2006, when the lands were handed over by the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) to members of the faith, THA Chief Secretary Orville London had long called for a structure to be built and, with the help of some Tobago businessmen, that mission has been accomplished. However, thieves recently stole 50 lengths of steel from the property. London toured the lands and observed the foundation works yesterday. \\u201cI'm saying that the returns that Tobago demands is not the money, not in resources, not in even tangible returns. The returns are to be measured by the number of lives that you touch, the number of troubled persons that you comfort, the number of young people nurtured and prepared,\\u201d said the Chief Secretary. And Assemblyman Handell Beckles stated that the future of the nation is in God's hands. \\u201cAnd that is why I am comfortable that the future of the church is in God's hands and I am comfortable as a politician that the future of Tobago is in God's hands, and I'm comfortable that the future of our nation is in God's hands,\\u201d Beckles said.

In a previous column we looked at a Christian's duty to God as his stewards in actively engaging with the environmental crisis we currently face. The Bible is full of teachings that call upon Christians to fulfil their role and responsibility as caretakers or stewards to God, the rightful owner of the earth. Stewardship is a moral obligation and environmental destruction is the destruction of God's creation. Christian leaders worldwide have issued a clarion call to action, to hear God's call to protect and care for the earth. This week we will look briefly at what another major religion, Hinduism has to say about protecting the earth. In ecology, we often refer to the 'web of Life'. Interpreted broadly, in this view all of Earth's creatures are connected and our actions (direct or indirect) have consequences. This concept is captured beautifully by a Native American chief, Chief Seattle (1886) \\\"Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth, all things are connected like the blood which unites one family. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.\\\" This 'web of life' and the concept of interconnectedness is a foundational belief of Hinduism. Hindus believe that we are not separate from Nature. References to our interconnectedness and our relationship to Nature can be found in the Vedas, Upanishads, Gita, Puranas, the great epics such as the Ramayana and in the words of Hindu saints. Hindus believe that the Divine is everywhere. From this viewpoint, practising Hindus are true superheroes of the environment. Dr Pankaj Jain, Professor of South Asian Religions and Ecology says that though Hinduism is a diverse religion that has many manifestations at regional and local levels, there are several unifying themes. He explains that Hindus view the earth as the sacred Goddess Devi, who is worshipped and respected. Hindus believe in the concept of dharma or duty and karma. Karma is a central tenet in Hinduism that refers to consequences of our actions, both good and bad. These actions affect our future, including reincarnation. According to Jain, our duty includes our responsibility to care for the earth and our treatment of nature affects our karma. A morning prayer, eloquently expresses these concepts: Samudra Vasane Devi, Parvata Stana Mandale Vishnupatni Namastubhyam, Paada Sparsham Kshamasva me. Mother Earth, who has the ocean as clothes and mountains and forests on her body, Who is the wife of Lord Vishnu, I bow to you. Please forgive me for touching you with my feet. Another teaching that is fundamental to the Hindu religion is living a simple life. Scriptures speak about restraint from overconsumption and pursuit of material pleasures referred to as Sanyasa. Sanyasa can be thought of as a pathway to liberation or moksha. Dr. Jain points to simple living as a model for the development of sustainable economies where the earth is respected. As the great Mahatma Gandhi, who walked the pathway of simple living warned: \\\"Nature has enough for everyone's needs but not for everyone's greed.\\\" Hindus around the world have joined other religious bodies to engage with the global environmental crisis from a moral and spiritual perspective. As early as 1986, coming out of the Assisi Declarations on Nature, Hindu leaders joined in the call for action concerning the environment and espoused the role Hindus play in saving the environment. Presented in 2009 at the Parliament of the World's Religions, Melbourne, Australia, the \\\"Hindu Declaration on Climate Change,\\\" issued the following statements. \\\"The Hindu tradition understands that man is not separate from nature, that we are linked by spiritual, psychological and physical bonds with the elements around us. Knowing that the Divine is present everywhere and in all things, Hindus strive to do no harm. We hold a deep reverence for life and an awareness that the great forces of nature\\u2014the earth, the water, the fire, the air and space\\u2014as well as all the various orders of life, including plants and trees, forests and animals, are bound to each other within life's cosmic web. We cannot continue to destroy nature without also destroying ourselves. The dire problems besetting our world\\u2014war, disease, poverty and hunger\\u2014will all be magnified many fold by the predicted impacts of climate change.\\\" In Trinidad and Tobago, we are blessed with a rich Hindu heritage. How can Hindu's act as leaders, demonstrating a better way to live with each other and our natural world If you have an example of Hindus, individuals or groups, who are in touch with our natural world and are shining examples of environmental stewardship, please feel free to share your story with us.

He delivered the feature address at the First National Diversity Conference at Hyatt Regency Hotel, Wrightson Road, Port of Spain, on Friday. Moonilal was serving as acting Prime Minister while PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar was in Panama last week. The conference theme was Diversity is Inclusion...It is our common thread. The acting PM also thanked former minister of National Diversity Clifton De Couteau, who is now heading Gender, Youth and Child Development, for his contribution, and wished him a speedy recovery from a mild stroke he suffered recently. Among those present were Minister of National Diversity and Social Integration Rodger Samuel and Tertiary Education and Skills Training Minister Fazal Karim. Diversity presentations were made by University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) provost Fazal Ali, anthropologist Dr Dylan Kerrigan and Dr Fazadudin Hosein, vice-president for Spiritual Development, University of the Southern Caribbean (USC). Moonilal said the one-day conference was an opportunity for participants to stimulate the belief of Trinidad and Tobagos joint heritage and promote the objective that diversity must come alive and vibrant in schools, business places, communities and homes. Diversity must not be linked to our cultural diversity, it must go beyond. Diversity is genuine respect for all, a respect that must be borne out of education and understanding of who we are, what makes each of us different but unique, each of us with a role in building our nation, he said. Diversity is strength, strength in our collective difference. Diversity is opportunity, opportunities to discover the worlds that are literally around us, next to us and which, if we listen, could make each of us better citizens. Moonilal made reference to Prime Minister Persad-Bissessars comments at the United Nations General Assembly debate on Global Economic Development in New York on September 26, when she said: There are too many fences between us, fences of politics, ideology, religion, ethnicity and traditions. Such fences cannot be vaulted with respect for diversity. He also said the PM had sent her best wishes and requested the conference papers for future reading.

We all know that there are many journalists who abuse their power and yet are quick to point out the State's abuse of power. This double-standard plagues our country and keeps us in a constant mire of Third World power plays where do so doh like so. I probably would not have bothered to comment had it been any of the many personalities passed off as talk-show hosts, but in the case of Mr Mohammed, whose intelligence and efficiency are obvious, I feel moved to speak up and show my understanding of the big picture. The clip that has been circulating shows not an interview nor a discussion but a battering of philosophies and principles. Religion and politics are kicked around like a football in a Soca Warriors game where no goals are scored and the only thing that happens is that the players come off muddy and tired. The danger here is the ignorance of the principles of Islam to which Mr Mohammed adheres. Mr Mohammed was put in the position of having to defend his philosophical beliefs and it may be interpreted that Mr Mohammed's Islamic beliefs were used as criteria to question his professional ethics and personal stance. There is nothing about this that can be deemed right. A man's religious and personal philosophies regarding how he makes sense of his life and his world are no other man's business to question. Equally important is the fact that in a country like ours it is so imperative to be mindful of how we treat with religious and cultural differences, especially when we have a public forum. Our misunderstanding of each other is based on ignorance; we simply do not know each other. When this ignorance is aired it is fuel for the radicals and the fanatics to build a bigger fire of hatred. We must all be responsible for ensuring that every creed and every race find an equal place here. This is the beauty of our island but it is also the bane if we do not understand it and know how to treat with it. Had the men in that clip understood the true importance of nation first, they could have used that opportunity to educate the public on the beauty of a country where differences in opinions and religious philosophies are lesser than the unification of a people.

In his Indian Arrival Day message, Carmona said, From their humble beginnings as indentured labourers, trained to focus all industrial skills in the sugar industry, the East Indian population has taken those same industrial skills and have had them metamorphosed in the creation of an environment of defining competencies in the fields of medicine, law, engineering, entrepreneurial business, politics, culture, religion and sports. This has redounded to real benefits to our country, the Caribbean region and the world at large. Today, the Indian diaspora in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean represents a vital and unrivalled thrust in world culture, education and politics. Against a background of extreme adversities, our Indian brothers and sisters have persevered and demonstrated that hard work, sacrifice and belief in God can trigger great rewards. The progressive response of the Trinidad and Tobago diaspora meshing other cultures with their art, music, cuisine and customs, have provided a fundamental platform for us being regarded as a rainbow nation. Throughout my life, I have always held a very close relationship with persons in my community and by extension the East Indian community. That relationship, very personal in many regards, has not swayed my fundamental belief in equality and just and fair treatment for all persons. In fact, I have been taught that fundamental and philosophy of life by many persons including gurus of Indian ancestry. As a United Nations prosecutor, I have had the unforgettable experience of being exposed to the horror that can result from intolerance and bigotry combined with ignorance and blinded aggression rooted in ethnic and religious differences both in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

The cruel language and open ridicule of gay persons, combined with the reported evictions of homosexuals by families and landlords paint a reality far different from the tolerant, easy-going society which we proclaim ourselves to be to the world. This newspaper has been openly supportive of the judgment delivered by Justice Devindra Rampersad. It is consistent with our position that the State has no business legislating the sexual activity of consenting adults in the privacy of their various domains. While there is a place for the State in our lives, it is not inside the bedrooms of consenting adults. We recognise that our view is not shared by some religious persons and other individuals but respect their right to express their opinion and to practise the tenets of their faith. These are rights available to all, including gay persons, under the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago. What is not acceptable is bigotry, zealotry and extremism from any quarter. Trinidad and Tobago is a secular state which guarantees not only the individual\\u2019s freedom of \\u201creligious belief and observance\\u201d but \\u201cfreedom of conscience\\u201d, which may or may not involve religion. We claimed these rights in the aftermath of a brutal history of religious and political persecution of the vast majority of our people. More than most, Caribbean people know what it is to be deprived of rights, including the right to their humanity. Out of that past, we created new nation states that today stand on a bedrock of the very rights from which most people were once excluded. We are still far from perfect. The right of adults to love and to enjoy each other is not the only right that is still denied. The disabled suffer equally from the odious provisions of the Immigration Act which prohibit physically and mentally handicapped persons\\u2013along with prostitutes and homosexuals\\u2013from entering this country. As demonstrated in the case of the Child Marriage Act, the evolution of society requires ongoing review of attitudes and practices in the context of increasing respect and recognition of rights. Once upon a time, the right to kill the so-called infidel enjoyed sweeping religious sanction across a broad swathe of the planet. Today, such sanction is reviled, including by those who once upheld it. The challenge for secular states like Trinidad and Tobago which commit to freedom of religious belief and practice, is to balance the rights of the group with the rights of the individual. This is the delicate process that Justice Rampersad so carefully engaged in arriving at his judgment. As the Government prepares to pursue it to the end, we all have the right and responsibility to have our say. What we do not have is the right to abuse and humiliate another or to discriminate against them in attempting to impose our will. This is a moment to give real meaning to the national watchword of tolerance. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

His literalist views on religion are not likely to win many adherents. However, his emphasis on God, God's law, and spirituality in general has direct relevance for our nation. It is precisely because we have become a secular society without all the institutions and values of a mature democratic society that we are in this mess today. We desperately need to re-invent a world view or common philosophy wherein we can all recognise our common humanity, civic duties, common needs and obligations to our nation. Most societies believe in some concept of God, some creation myth, some system of law and clear responsibilities to its people/citizens. Without a commitment to a religion, spirituality, legal system or philosophy, one's life is barren of meaning and one is adrift like straw in the wind. Those who condemn the idea of religion on the altar of a materialist science ignore the fact that science deals only with material entities and, thus, can neither prove nor disprove the existence of God, essentially a non-material entity. One cannot turn to science for love or compassion. What is vitally important to recognise is belief in a transcendent deity is a universal phenomenon. Whether you agree or not with such a belief is irrelevant. It is the effect of such a belief on the believer that is important. In its positive aspects, religious belief has given coherence and stability to society throughout the ages. It is at the basis of Western civilisation and western values, including democracy. Its negative aspect is reflected in earlier historical cruelties inflicted in the name of religion. Nevertheless, there is convincing empirical and anecdotal proof believers in all religions are generally happier, more serene, kinder, live longer and are more trustworthy than non-believers. Believers constitute the bedrock on which the structure of social norms, values and laws of their society is erected. That is why believers are less likely to be criminals than non-believers. Our criminals believe in nothing but greed, selfishness, cruelty, injustice and violence against their fellow citizens. They are rapidly destroying the moral fabric of our nation. They are like weeds grown in toxic soil without proper care or nutrition. Neuroscience tells us violent criminals usually possess a smaller and undeveloped neocortex\\u2014the site of rationality, the only brain part that can restrain the violent impulses coming from another brain part, the amygdala. This latter responds to danger by the flight-or-fight syndrome. It has assisted the evolution of man by increasing his awareness to external danger. When we give way to anger and engage in fights or commit murder, we are being controlled by the amygdala. When we immediately withdraw into ourselves as a pattern of behaviour whenever faced with conflict, we are also being controlled. The appropriate response that would come from a functioning neocortex is to be reflective, objective, rational and moral in our behaviour. Neuroscience has pointed out violent criminals are generally brain damaged in some way. Brain damage, of course, cannot be used by criminals as a justification for their criminality. Pastor Samuel is correct to use the metaphors of Satan and satanic behaviour to describe their motivation, for their thoughts, values and actions all fall within the category of \\\"evil\\\". Simply put, murderers, especially gang killers, are evil and should be treated as such. We should not be tolerating the presence of gangs in our midst. We do not need them. They should be extirpated as quickly as possible. The Romans would have eliminated them immediately. The tragedy of T&T is that murder and acting out one's violent thoughts has become legitimate because our police forces are relatively inefficient because of educational deficits, poor training, lack of effective resources and inadequate leadership. It is comforting that a large section of our population is law abiding and kind, the consequence of believing in a God. We need to re-affirm the great importance of spirituality and religion for restoring and strengthening the moral fabric of our demoralised society and the lives of its citizens. It should begin in the home, addressed in the school, and emphasised by civic leaders. I refer to religion as any otherworldly view of life. I think of spirituality as a continuing search for ways to improve the moral quality of one's life.

Today marks 15 years since the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon carried out by a group as close to evil and as far from the tenets of their religion as you could get. New York City shook and suffered the atrocities live on TV. Everyone in every country knew that the world would forever be changed. I have been to Ground Zero and it is both a nasty scar and a beautiful monument to the worst and the best of that dreadful day. Nine days later George W Bush addressed the nation in a speech that introduced the world to Al Qaeda. The president said, \\u201cAl Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money; its goal is remaking the world\\u2014and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.\\u201d While Bush tried to walk a tight line and not condemn all Muslims, collective emotions were understandably high and some very negative, xenophobic views of Islam were formed, and are sadly still held by many Americans today. Islam is seen by some as a primitive, stagnated and closed religion that calls for barbaric, deadly and disproportionate punishment such as the fatwa issued on Salman Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses. The religion is viewed by many in the West as unrepentantly sexist and violent towards women, as well as supportive and protective of radical and violent acts done in its name. Countries where Sharia law is practised are viewed as alien theocracies that are actively adversarial to US interests. With those ill-conceived views about Islam flourishing in a post-9/11 world, it is easy to see how Islamophobia spread like a cancer across the US. It was present before 9/11, but after the twin towers collapsed many in the US were convinced war was a necessity to protect America's freedom from the terrors of Islam. In what would remain for me one of the greatest examples that there is always so much more right with America than there is wrong, a black man was elected president for two terms whose middle name was Hussein and whose father was Muslim. Nevertheless, 15 years later Islamophobia is so endemic and so almost mainstream that there is a presidential candidate who has made platform promises to impose a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the US\\u2014as well as putting all American Muslims on a register, and he is supported by millions. Living in America over the past three years has been incredible; however, with the presidential election approaching, I've recognised fault lines I've never seen before. Every day, a perverted idea of Islam is highlighted in the media and there is a potential president who uses intimidation, xenophobia and Islamophobia to scare American voters. Usually the last place big countries look for answers regarding social justice, tolerance and integration issues is smaller countries like my Trinidad and Tobago. But the fact is we in T&T do social justice, tolerance and integration remarkably well. Trinis experienced a violent and bloody attack in the form of an attempted coup 26 years ago in which Parliament and then prime minister ANR Robinson and some of his MPs were held hostage. The hostilities and hostage stand-off ended after six days with the president giving amnesty to the leader of the Jamaat al Muslimeen and his armed insurgents. The body count was nowhere near that of 9/11 but the threat to our freedom and democracy was perhaps greater. The psychic damage done to the people of T&T was significant. People were angry and wanted justice, no different from post-9/11 America. It's easy to think that since this attack there would be permanent fault lines between Muslims and the rest of the country but I have come to the conclusion that Islamophobia simply doesn't exist in T&T. I can also say that when the media and other opinion shapers look back at the attempted coup the criticism and blame is confined to the leader and his followers, not their religion and the other nationals who practise it. How is it that tiny Trinidad and Tobago could provide an answer for an issue that has plagued some of the largest countries for decades T&T has more public holidays than the US and the majority are religious holidays. We celebrate Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Shouter Baptist holidays. We celebrate Indian Arrival Day as well as Emancipation Day. I grew up knowing about Eid-ul-Fitr and Christmas, Divali and Easter, celebrated freedom from slavery and the arrival of East Indian immigrants. The difference is we don't just celebrate different religions, we embrace them and all our Trini brothers and sisters who practise them. The fabric of Trinidadian society is a rich tapestry of values and traditions of so many different cultures and religions. The US has ten federal holidays a year. It might be hard for some to imagine states such as Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Vermont or Texas learning much about Islam but I feel if Eid were a federal holiday the US would be closer to engaging Islam and ridding the US of Islamophobia. Exposure and education are the first steps taken towards tolerance and the US has yet to take baby steps to mainstream one of the world's great religions.

A general observation, made of all Hindu societies in the context of assessing the relevance of Swami Vivekananda and his Vedantic thoughts on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary, was made light of. Since it all began with an Express reporter's inquisitiveness (January 5) as to what I meant exactly, let me clear the air by coming directly to the point. My reference to present-day Hinduism, a religion which, unlike any other, has surmounted the vicissitudes of time and come out stronger, must have had some strong points inherent in itself. That, in my view, is its philosophy which is universal, all-inclusive and embracing and that which appeals to and transcends all other religious beliefs. And that is Vedanta or Upanishads, the kernel of Hindu philosophy, for which India is known the world over and through the ages. My reference was also to a certain section of priests and pundits who, I feel, and in this I am joined by a good part of this country's intelligentsia and the younger generation, have led gullible masses with their superior knowledge in conducting rituals. I must make it clear that I have never decried rituals or belittled pundits. In fact my grandfather was a noted pundit (scholar) of his time and much of his scholarly inheritances have come down to me through my father, who was a pundit of no less renown. The fact that the organising committee of Swami Vivekananda's 150th birth anniversary celebrations was chaired by a pundit who is an extremely erudite, intelligent and articulate person of great merit, says it all. I have always believed, taking my inspiration from Swami Vivekananda, that every religion in the world has three essential components philosophy, mythology and rituals and each complements the others. It is therefore but logical that religion cannot neglect one for the others, otherwise the religion would risk decadence and decay. The same for Hinduism too, at the beginning of the 21st century, when it needs to be evaluated in the context of a rational and scientific environment and questions have to be answered instead of being swept under the carpet or the questioners being browbeaten under a cloak of arrogance and deceit. It is against this backdrop that Swami Vivekananda needs to be evaluated if we have to discuss the relevance of his message. And that we did, over six days of interaction with the Trinidad population through a diverse range of activities. Starting with an exhibition of books, pictures and posters and a pictorial depiction of Swamiji's life all resources brought from India we presented a cultural programme in the Bisram Gopie Auditorium of the Divali Nagar, sanctified by the presence of Swamiji himself with a serene bust of the master right at the entrance. It was a reminder of the celebrations at the same venue marking the centenary of the Swamji's address at the Chicago Parliament of Religions where, for the first time ever, the western world was exposed to the philosophy of Hinduism through the principles of Vedanta. And the Upanishads had found their greatest voice. Imbued with the teachings of his \\\"illiterate\\\" master, Sri Ramakrishna, a person seeped in the \\\"jnana\\\" (knowledge) of the ancient Shastras (spiritual texts), whom the great French savant Romain Rolland had described as the \\\"consummation of two thousand years of the spiritual life of three hundred million peoples\\\", the new message of the soul, the symphony of India, Swami Vivekananda had burst forth at the Chicago Parliament representing a universal religion, a religion with which each of the 3,000 delegates could identify. In all seven sessions that he addressed, Swamiji was the last to speak, lest people not walk out of the Parliament. Such was his arresting charm, his awesome personality. To him religion was a means to salvation through social service and serving the basic needs of the poorest, the \\\"Daridra Narayana\\\" (God's poor) and also to fill the spiritual vacuum of the material West with loftiest thoughts of the human mind. Here was a man who was admirably linking the East and the West through Hinduism, the mother of all religions, not through empty rituals. They had been shunned and relegated to the margins of a hackneyed ideology but the brilliance of Hinduism shone forth all over America and England by the time the Swami had finished his first pilgrimage to the West. His return to India was tumultuous as he addressed the multitudes in Colombo, Madras, Ramnad and countless other places in southern India with his stirring call, \\\"Arise, Awake and Stop not until the goal is reached\\\". This, then, was our motto the immortal verse of the Kathopanishad and artiste after artiste, young and old, sang, recited, danced and set to music the vibrations of those eternal words as the entire Bisram Gopie Auditorium at the Divali Nagar was moved to ecstasy.

But the wonders of modern technology sometimes transmit the stark reality of the cruelty and barbarity of some contemporary human cultures. In one on-line English newspaper there was a brief video clip of a public daylight whipping of a woman by more than one policeman in Somalia. No details were ventured on the \\\"crime\\\" for which she was whipped. She was fully clothed in what I imagine to be an enforced dress code complete with head covering, ordered to sit on the ground surrounded by men, while two uniformed policemen took turns whipping her, not with canes but with long corded whip. The scene was interjected with her screams. As disgusting as the scene was the more abhorrent was the behaviour of the two policemen. When she defensively grabbed hold of the whip, another policeman emerged behind her with his whip and commenced whipping her across her back, both policemen cackling with laughter at her screams. The culture of the country, I suppose. The word \\\"culture\\\"it has so many meanings. The primary meaning however refers to the collective patterns of socially transmitted behaviour of human communities, including beliefs, languages, history, institutions, recreation, arts, science, commerce, laws and governance and so on. It must be noted, however, that cultures may differ markedly and often change. When one hears the word culture in the case of T&T it is more often understood to mean either entertainment of some form or folk and religious ways. But if we accept the primary meaning of the word we must accept that our culture must necessarily include many negatives. Compared with many T&T is supposedly highly corrupt, contemptuous of law, with disgusting road manners, cares little for the environment, littering and degrading, generating much noise and disorder, with most of our national institutions failing in their responsibilities to citizens. The one thing that continues to intrigue about our culture is the theme that Kevin Baldeosingh from time to time so patiently and clinically explains, the broad general correlation between religiosity and crime levels in different countries. For all the religiosity of T&T and the voluminous prayers that fly up to Heaven each day we continue to be a noisy, disordered, lawless, violent and crime-ridden society. We often continue to hear that we are a multicultural and multi-religious society, sometimes even with a sense of awe. On the other hand there is no doubt that cultures, including their subsets, can often bind peoples beneficially and support some measure of order, even as there may be strong divisions in that culture. At the same time there can hardly have any human culture where the process of binding does not involve some degree of coercion, in many cases extremely violent coercion. Religions may do it in different ways, some through the indoctrination from early childhood that may involve threats of one kind or another, or, through religious law that in some cases prescribes the death penalty for individual behaviours that would normally be ignored in other cultures. A Christian woman in Pakistan is sentenced to death for the \\\"crime\\\" of blasphemy the \\\"evidence\\\" being given by a group of Muslim women. Blasphemy is still on our law books as a criminal offence but is now ignored, whereas in Pakistan it may attract the death penalty as was recently reported. Perhaps some will note the irony of blasphemy being in some countries blasphemy against the dominant national religionin T&T against Christianity and in Pakistan against Islam. Perhaps some of the core values of the major religions may be shared, even by atheists and agnostics. These values however are few. It is when you get down to the broader customs, rituals and dictates of these that we see the divisive and exploitative methods of religions. It is not for a moment that I assume that religion or religions will disappear. But to survive in a more liberal world each religion or subset must use every possible device to maintain market share of the pool of available individuals, in some cases with promises and in others with repression. But can any Trinbagonian imagine living in a theocratic state and living under barbaric religious laws. T&T for all its faults is extremely lucky in that its governance has been in the traditions of the coloniser. We are what we are largely because of our history and culture that has been derived from western parliamentary systems that for the past few centuries have managed progressively to contain and diminish the powers of the Christian churches, with governments becoming progressively more secular. But even in some cultures as subsets continue to slaughter each other in the finest tradition of Christian religious violence of the past, now referred to as sectarian violence where Muslims slaughter Muslims, I imagine that some male Trinis might actually have enjoyed the public whipping of a woman. * Julian Kenny, chairman of the Environmental Management Authority, is a biologist and natural history author.

These charlatans have always been around and prey on the insecurities of not only the most vulnerable in society, but also on the supposedly educated and worldly. The arrest brings to the forefront a deep mania in our populace and speaks to the culture and mindset of our country. Sometimes harmful, at others helpful, belief in the supernatural and all of the associated fetishes and rituals is ingrained in our culture and psyche. The very notion of what is obeah is problematic and reflects pervading norms of power. What is called obeah means different things to different groups and the dominant meaning of the word is assigned by the powerful in society. For instance, the rituals of the Spiritual Shouter Baptists who meld Indian, African and Christian culture were and, sadly, are still seen as obeah and evil by many in society. The same thing happens within groups. The practices of worshippers of the goddess Kali are sometimes called obeah and evil by other Hindus whose views are tainted by their own prejudices and the blindness of the leaders in their sects. At the risk of inviting controversy, I would ask: why is there a distinction drawn between obeah and religion Both seek to access supernatural power, both are practices by people professing to have some connection with or insight into the workings of the universe and forces outside the universe. Both lack any clear logic in their dogmas and both are rooted in tradition and rest on the faith of their adherents. To move away from the arrogant and dismissive way that obeah and the spiritual arts are written about by the self-professed educated, I offer instead a nuanced understanding of what is happening in our country. Lest we forget, the belief in the supernatural runs rampant in our society. Our last prime minister was rumoured to have consorted with a \\\"seer woman\\\" who just so happened not to have seen the landslide defeat at the polls for her patron. Numerous are the other reports of the political, educated and business classes consulting with obeah practitioners to achieve some aim. Why is there this strong belief in obeah and the supernatural, and what are the implications for our nation A cookie-cutter response would be our \\\"backwardness\\\" and the lack of education and learning in our country. This would be quite false. If it's one thing, we are not backward nor are we uneducated. Such an answer also fails to address the consulting of obeah people by the educated. One of the real reasons may be uncertainty. There is evidence in developmental scholarship that shattered expectations and uncertainty leads to a resurgence of, or increased fervour in religious convictions and beliefs. I offer this same reason for the pervading belief in obeah and magic in our society. We live in uncertain times. There is much fear and much anxiety in our country. Some may find solace in prayer and the rosary, while others may find comfort in knowing they spent $10,000 on a \\\"guard\\\" from the obeah man. Either way, these charms help to alleviate the anxiety of everyday living, especially in these turbulent times. More closely associated with our unique cultural history is the power of tradition and imagination. We may be speeding toward a tech-savvy condition where the youth are constantly chastised for losing values, but the stories told by nanny and grandpa still exist at the forefront of our minds. Legends and tales of la diablesse, lagahoo and soucoyant are part of all of our childhoods. Whispers of the girl ghost at Claxton Bay or the dealings with bucks by the business class have enriched our folklore for generations and are still around today. These stories form powerful parts of our national psyche and though we may embrace the way of logic, technology and science, we never completely rid ourselves of them. The problem arises, however, when these beliefs are abused and come to hinder good judgment. In the case of con men and professed healers, there is much more at stake than money. While it is terrible for people to be scammed out of their money, what is even more pressing is when they are led to do things that are detrimental to their well-being. The obvious and saddening case is the disgusting advice by these charlatans to people to stop taking medication and instead use herbs or trust in some sort of magic. There is great worry in Africa and in other places where \\\"bush doctors\\\" have stopped people from taking anti-retroviral drugs for HIV. This has lead to death and the spreading of the disease by many deluded believers. The same has occurred in Trinidad and Tobago and will continue to occur. In these instances, the culprits should be charged with manslaughter since they are directly responsible for deaths. Appropriate legislation should be drawn up to deal with such types. Belief in the supernatural may seem illogical, but the world would be a more boring place without it. Trinidad and Tobago has a unique culture and, instead of trying to suppress it, we should embrace it, but always understanding these are simply tales and stories that make the world much more interesting.

There is a strong tendency to not offend or criticise religious institutions or beliefs and this constrains the public conversation on issues such as homosexuality and abortion. Individuals largely lack the conviction to abandon the tenets taught to them as children and the few dissenters that crop up are laughed off and told to \\\"Lighten up!\\\" or \\\"Calm down!\\\". I politely decline both offers. The ethos of mysticism and credulity in the populace has lead to a stunted Intelligentsia and has wormed its way into the Government. The disdain towards academia has led to mass scientific illiteracy and our culture is the poorer for it. I do not wish to express antagonism towards any devout or pious member of any faith. That would be impertinent and wrong of me. What concerns me, however, is the eagerness to \\\"be a part\\\" and the willingness to be indoctrinated. It is a culture of blind, unquestioning faith in what you're told in which scepticism is discouraged and dissent feared. In the recent public discussion on homosexuality (which I think could not have come up soon enough), the religious are quick to invoke the \\\"word\\\" of their supernatural authority as if it has any place in a civil rights conversation. They recycle facetious non-arguments and unscientific babble from decades ago, most if not all of it borrowed from the religious right in the US. They would be funny if only anyone was willing to laugh. So, what to do Here's my advice, for lack of a less condescending term, to those involved. To religious leaders: You are fully entitled to have your beliefs, to worship your deity/ies and to find salvation in whatever form you choose. But recognise that yours is not the only belief. Do not, for one second, presume to tell people how to live their lives. Recognise that your holy book(s) gives you absolutely no authority moral or otherwise over anyone, and especially over those who do not subscribe to your beliefs. Recognise that yours is a personal faith and as such, while it is your right to have it, it is to have no influence in government, scientific inquiry or human rights affairs. To the followers/congregations: Resist the urge to be a sheep. Take the risk of thinking for yourself. Do not allow what is screamed from the pulpit to sway your own morality and make you believe archaic, hateful nonsense. Learn to embrace the plurality and nuance of the world and let go of any conceptions of Utopia. You might say, \\\"But my beliefs give me hope, comfort,\\\" etc. Fine for you. But for the sake of all that is good, try to come out of your comfort zone. Teach yourself to be suspicious and critical of authority in whatever form it takes and stop following the crowds. To the politicians: Your job is to listen to the people all of them not to a higher power only you can see.

This prayer is respect for life in our nation. As you know, this is what I believe to be the fundamental root challenge that is facing us\\u2014a culture of disrespect which is all-pervasive. The root of this challenge is spiritual. All the major religions observe the golden rule\\u2014do unto others as you would have them do unto you. This golden thread runs through all the major religions, and binds humanity together in an interdependent ecosystem. My good is dependent upon the good of others. My growth is dependent on the growth of others. My flourishing is dependent upon the flourishing of others. This fundamental spiritual law is the basic foundation for humanity. Without this foundation, we cannot build a sustainable civilisation where people flourish. This is the deep challenge facing Trinidad and Tobago today. We want to flourish without ensuring all others flourish. It cannot happen! Rugged individualism with its exaggerated push for human freedom has taken us to the brink of the precipice. At this existential edge of human decency, we now have very difficult decisions to make. What type of civilisation do we want to build in Trinidad and Tobago? What type of people do we want to become? Looking at the golden rule it seems very simple\\u2014do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It may even seem self-interested. At its heart, it is being other-focused. If you want a good life you need to limit your freedoms. You need to treat others as you want to be treated. You need to ensure others have what you dream for and aspire towards. You need to ensure all citizens in our nation have access to the dreams and aspirations that you have. You need to live exaggerated responsibility. It is from this understanding that we begin to understand the root of our interconnectedness. Here in the Catholic tradition we speak about the common good, the good that we must all seek and work for if we are all to flourish. The group 3Canal captured this in \\u201cGood Morning, Neighbour\\u201d. They say: \\u201cI have a little remedy, a guaranteed philosophy to make this a better place, healing for the human race\\u201d. Their remedy is for us to be neighbourly to each other, to acknowledge each other as human beings, and to engage each other and recognise the humanity and dignity of the other. In South Africa they say ubuntu. Generally, it means humanity. It is translated, \\u201cI am because you are.\\u201d This lays the foundation for building a civilisation. The building blocks are not pitch, oil or concrete and steel. It is the quality of relationships among citizens. It is the interdependence that we understand in our striving for excellence and growth. My existence and happiness are dependent upon yours. This is a different foundation from our current foundation in Trinidad and Tobago. There is a Yoruba proverb that says: \\u201cOne who is going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on himself to feel how it hurts.\\u201d Placed in the negative it puts forward the point very well. Your actions to others should be tested on yourself first. In Hinduism the text from the Taittiriya Upanishad, reads: \\u201cThose acts that you consider good when done to you, do those to others, none else\\u201d (Shikshavalli, Eleventh Anuvaka). We go after \\u201cwhat we can get\\u201d, or rather \\u201cwhat\\u2019s in it for me\\u201d (WIIFM). We put the \\u2018I\\u2019 and the needs and desires of the self at centre. This putting self at centre is opposed to all religious traditions, and thus opposed to all ways of being in relationship with God. Trinidad and Tobago is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious community. Our largest traditions are Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. We have many other traditions also that make up this incredible place. We also have humanists and atheists in our land who do not believe in God but we all share a common humanity. We all occupy the 5,131 km2. We need to understand that my happiness is dependent upon your happiness. I want to ask every citizen to consider the golden rule. The fact that the golden rule transcends culture, religions and belief, suggests it is a moral code written into the fabric of who we are\\u2014our DNA. By definition, prayer turns us outwards after leading us inward, away from our self towards the Other: the wholly Other, God! By this turn of mind and consciousness, we create a new foundation for our entire being. I am not the foundation of my being. I did not bring myself into being, I am not the origin, and I am not the end. There is one who is greater than me who brought everything into being. I am surrendering to this One. I seek communion with this One. I want to know, love and serve this One. By turning from self, we change the basic proposition of our national consciousness. It is no longer about \\u2018me\\u2019. It is about God! This is the first step in our religious conversion. The death of a former Petrotrin worker last month by his own hands, attributed by relatives and the union to his inability to cope with loss of his job, has re-focused attention on the Government\\u2019s inadequate impact assessment and post-closure services to workers prior to the dramatic folding of the State company. IS it that the Government is powerless to treat with the rise in home invasions, robberies and murders? In order to fight crime, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service should be efficiently resourced with modern, state-of-the art equipment. Let us face it, the nation is a great mess and the majority of our citizens deserve this because of the political party and politicians they support. They, like Government politicians, do nothing whatsoever to try to put our deliberate adverse situation and worsening condition right. LIKE most Trinbagonains, everything I know about the political policies of the People\\u2019s Republic of China comes from the Jackie Chan movie The Tuxedo. So I was quite surprised to learn about the current fate of one of China\\u2019s ethnic minorities; the Uighurs. Concacaf (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football) dream killers would destroy the spirit of what World Cup football stands for, if not stopped. Around Emancipation Day, I\\u2019m struck by two contrasting views on Haiti.

Photo courtesy PAUL VOISIN HAPPY BIRTHDAY!: Keshorn Walcott prepares to unleash one of his big throws in the Falcon Games men's javelin event, at the Hasely Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain, yesterday. Walcott, who turns 19 today, won with a 77.53 metres effort--a new Central American and Caribbean (CAC) junior (under-20) record. Photo courtesy PAUL VOISIN At the outset, allow me to congratulate the members of the Spiritual Baptist community on the celebration of the 60th Anniversary of the Proscription of the Shouters Prohibition Ordinance and the 15th Anniversary of the national celebration. You have done well over these years, to keep alive the triumph of the pioneers who struggled to see the enactment of an Act which would give substance to the words of our National Anthem which declare that \\\"every creed and race find an equal place\\\". Until then, a substantial number of citizens, being members of your faith, were debarred from exercising the right of freedom of worship which is enshrined in our Constitution. So the repeal of the Ordinance on 30th March 1951was indeed a landmark ruling, giving substance, as it does, to that aspect of our Constitution. It is a matter of record, both oral and written, that Shouter Baptist women played a significant role in the battle for equality of treatment, in relation to other religions. This should come as no surprise, as in secular matters, women have made their presence felt. Even during the infamous World Wars, women quickly took their places in the war effort, if not at the front, in factories and in the care of the wounded. Earlier this month, Trinidad and Tobago participated in the worldwide celebration of International Women's Day and so it is timely and fitting that the theme of the National Evangelical Spiritual Baptists celebration is \\\"Women in the Shouter Baptist faith\\\". The world is increasingly paying attention to the condition of women - at one end, our hopes, accomplishments, exploits and at the other, our subordination, situations of exploitation based on gender, as well as the deliberate disadvantage at which some of us are placed, as a direct result of traditions and customs which dictate the pace. But with respect to the latter, one has to be very cautious about disturbing what may be regarded as the natural order, given the societies in which those traditions and customs are in place. Wisdom must prevail in the strategies that are in place or contemplated. Apart from the general context of man/woman relationship as evolved in Trinidad and Tobago, there have been, in religious circles, certain parameters that have tended to define the role and place of women. But this is changing to some extent and women are becoming more visible in positions of leadership in traditional religions as the ordination of women to the priesthood has increased. In the Spiritual Baptist faith, you have taken the lead, a clear lead, in that, for many years, you have been ordaining women to the rank of Bishop and Archbishop, a position yet to be adopted in some of the older religious denominations. But it is a place that the women of your faith have earned, if such a word is appropriate. It is a place which is not based solely on manifest spiritual growth. I would think that your women's role in the struggle for emancipation of the faith had a secular dimension in that, like Lydia, Chloe, Damaris, who clung to her faith in spite of ridicule and Priscilla in the early Christian Church, who all ministered to the temporal needs of the members, so that the message could be spread, Spiritual Baptist women did the same. And then there was Deborah, the warrior prophetess, agitator and judge who defended her nation against the enemy of the day, much as the women in St Vincent did battle for their beliefs and were arrested and imprisoned. It is also recorded that, in Trinidad and Tobago, Caroline French opened her home to the 14 protesters, 12 of them women, who resisted the Shouters Prohibition Ordinance and were arrested on 17th December, 1917. I am quite certain that these are only two of many stories that can be told regarding the campaign of women in the Shouter Baptist faith. Instances such as these give historical validity to the places of honour that have been given to women of the faith and should be a guidepost for succeeding generations, in pursuit of their own places in the hierarchical order of things. In all of the strivings, though, one must bear in mind and keep always at the forefront of one's thinking, that there are two dimensions to be considered - the spiritual and the secular. Recognising that there remain certain traditional attitudes towards women, which some of us are reluctant to face, one must guard against bringing into an environment shaped by religion in this case, the Shouter Baptist religion an over-zealous feminist thrust. Lest I be misunderstood, let me assure you that I am well aware of some of the obstacles that women face, simply on the grounds of gender. Nevertheless, I believe that while we have all been created equal, there is some validity in the view held by quite a number of persons, that there are some roles that are specific to men and others to women. We must be careful, therefore, that in securing the understanding among women as among men, that we have equal value, we do not overturn the responsibilities as suggested in the beginning, that is to say, in creation history, to such a degree, that chaos takes the place of order. Sometimes, there is a fine line between what is acceptable and what is not. What is important is that, as we evolve and take our places, truly side by side, this does not result in loss of dignity and of mutual respect, for anyone. I have confidence in our women, to continue to assume leadership roles in religion as in areas of secular activities. I have confidence also that, within the Shouter Baptist faith, you are capable of securing accommodations among yourselves that will enable you to continue to assume leadership roles with sensitivity and with proper focus...

I'm sure their intentions are well placed. But in a society with diverse religious ideologies, even those opposed to organised religion, one cannot implicitly assume that his/her personal belief would be shared by others. Unless volunteers have consent from parents and the relevant authority, their presence at government schools will naturally create problems. Suffice it to say, there are misguided people in every sphere of life, even in the church. Children are impressionable. As such, neglectful parenting opens up avenues for predators and the exploitation of children in general. Parents, don't rest on your laurels.

You may find inspiration for your answer in a new book about four Americans\\u2014a priest, an atheist, a Native American and a baker\\u2014who put it all on the line for their creeds. The Book \\u201cDeep Conviction: True Stories of Ordinary Americans Fighting for the Freedom to Live Their Beliefs\\u201d (Shadow Mountain) is by professor and lawyer Steven T. Collis. An advocate and a scholar, he believes religious freedom is \\u201ca fundamental liberty protecting all individuals living in this country, allowing us to exist in relative peace with one another.\\u201d This peace, he adds, is unique in history and exceptional even in the world today. Collis notes, \\u201cReligion is not what leads us to battle, it\\u2019s the lack of religious liberty.\\u201d The book offers insights into religious liberty through the stories of four ordinary Americans who risked their reputations to preserve and live their personal beliefs. Although vastly different in many ways, they share such qualities as conviction and determination. The Courageous Four \\u2022 In 1813, a Catholic priest in New York City faced prison after a grand jury subpoenaed him for refusing to divulge the identity of a jewelry thief who admitted to the crime during the sacrament of confession. \\u2022 In 1959, an atheist in Maryland was forced to stand up for his beliefs when the state required him to sign an oath that said he believed in God before he could work as a notary public. The United States Supreme Court would decide his fate. \\u2022 In 1989, a Klamath Indian man walked into the highest court of the nation to fight for the right to practice the central sacrament of the Native American Church after the state of Oregon had declared it illegal. \\u2022 And, finally, in 2017, a Christian baker and a gay couple took their cases to the United States Supreme Court after the baker declined to create a custom wedding cake to celebrate the couple\\u2019s same-sex marriage, fearing it would violate his duty to God. Written with the pace of a novel, Collis\\u2019 book brings these stories to life in a way that reflects their universality and the broad principles they represent. He stresses how the notion of religious freedom for all, truly cherished, allows justice and protection for everyone, religious or not.

The Muslims are now running scared with the privatisation of their belief by businessmen who have no religious claim to fame. Why can't we perform the sacred pilgrimage, if we so choose, with an imam, the religious head of the mosque The number of people journeying to Hajj annually outside of the local groups, opting to put their hope in international groups with Islamic scholars and imams, is alarming. One must not continue to think that we elderly Muslims are an easy pushover. Wining and dining ministers is now the latest ploy to disconnect religion from the church. The Muslim community definitely needs a union, or opposition group or pressure group led by those in the spiritual know, so the rights of Muslims would not be trampled upon by Government and \\\"big business\\\". Imagine the formation of a Hajj Council by a few and not a single religious organisation can say boo. No ASJA voice, no TML voice, no TIA voicenot a single religious inclusionand even convincing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send out a letter to the Saudi Arabia Embassy. Imagine the number of pilgrims who return complaining year after year. Who will listen to the complaints these pilgrims endure Who will listen to the decisions or judgments of religious leaders Who is willing to set up the conditions for one to be considered to lead in religious affairs What are the religious affiliations of the present so-called leaders of the Hajj Council ASJA, having been skilfully relieved from this high and noble task after some 43 years of serving Trinidad and Tobago, now has to sit on the sidelines and wonder where did it go wrong, who pulled the carpet from under its feet and when will the organisation ever regain its status. Pilgrims over the years, and especially last year, were so ill-treated that today, they are nursing their woundscaused by mismanagement, mistakes and a lack of religious care and concern. Groups were told by religious scholars of the highest eminence that although they paid for the Hajj pilgrimage, they ended up with only a painful and shameful vacation. My advice to pilgrims is they should be careful with business and politics in their religious affairs, even if they get Caribbean Airlines to fly only on their terms or get the Government to secure Hajj visas for \\\"big business\\\" only. Who is brave enough to challenge the overthrow of Hajj by business and Government. The Muslim public needs to form an association to represent the oppressed and to seek redress. Contracts must be drawn up and notarised to protect the elderly, who are the majority of targets of this now-hijacked trade. Let us hear from the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Transport; tell the people how you came into formally endorsing a bunch of greedy businessmen at the expense of our grandparents and others who are taken advantage of annually. My dear ministers, don't you find it passing strange that our citizens are prepared to go with foreign groups even though they have to pay more Pilgrims are no longer allowing scare tactics to discourage them.

The fact that this religious group was able to survive the period of proscription which was meant to legislate them out of existence shows their determination to hold on to their faith in face of legalised persecution. The \\u201cShouter\\u201d Prohibition Ordinance in Trinidad was repealed on March 30, 1951 after years of tireless campaigning. Spiritual Baptists reflecting upon the prohibition years often claim that the admonitions of the Apostle Paul prepared them to deal with police raids on their services and other rituals such as baptisms, the smashing of their makeshift churches, the beatings of their members, the fines and imprisonment imposed by the law, and the harassment, contempt and ridicule they received from the police. The Spiritual Baptist faith is not just a church or a denomination. It is a \\u201cfaith,\\u201d a belief system that is rooted within an African conceptualisation of religion and a deep spirituality which attests to the work of the Holy Spirit in shaping the faith and governing the lives of the faithful. Slavery left a horrendous legacy amongst Africans in the colony. After full emancipation in 1838, freed slaves were poor, they were unable to purchase land, jobs were difficult to find or offered at starvation wages, and as a result they were forced to work at least part-time for their former slave masters. They squatted in their villages, often in tied cottages on the land of their former masters, they were insecure, but preserved a sense of themselves and positive self-respect. It was this group of people that formed the nucleus of the Spiritual Baptist movement. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months. Regarding the arrest of Minister Marlene McDonald in the ongoing investigation of corruption charges levelled against her, Dr Rowley bought that wholesale.

For some reason, the so-called religious leaders of our nation have taken it upon themselves to paint their followers as a band of dogmatic robots who are incapable of thinking. The so-called leaders of the major religions are nothing more than overdone caricatures and trilobites who do not represent their constituents and are doing more harm than good. Most of the people who belong to a religion are quite happy to live and let live, are apathetic to many issues that seem to set their leaders on fire and are in favour of progressive legislation and modernity. These leaders and, sadly, a few other vociferous minorities need to keep in mind that the state of Trinidad and Tobago is a secular republic with a strong constitution guarding the separation of church and state. Far be it for me or for anyone else to deny any person or group the right to belief and practice of religion. The right to religious freedom is enshrined in our constitution and I believe this is a positive thing, as it shows that we, as a nation, are able to respect others and co-exist despite our religious differences. The place of religion, however, is in the church/ temple/mosque, etc. Religion and religious leaders need to take care of the moral and spiritual souls of their flock and leave the business of public policy to the State. The laws of the secular Republic of Trinidad and Tobago need to be formulated, debated and passed by the legislature for the benefit of the nation. During formal public consultations, religious groups as well as other stakeholders have the right to make their positions known. It will be up to the State to balance the interests of all stakeholders and do what is best for the nation. At the end of the day, however, the religious need to respect the secular composition of our nation. It is under these guiding principles that our multifaceted nation can continue to flourish and function in peace. No religious group should have the ability to influence the State as this will undoubtedly lead to anarchy. It would be myopic and naive of me to believe that there is no religion in law. The basis of our constitution is Judeo-Christian and most of it is still based on these world views, with a few local tweaks here and there. The problem with this, however, is that Judeo-Christian and secular thought have progressed tremendously since 1962 and yet, as the world marches on, our constitution is stuck in the past. The few attempts that have been made to write the wrongs of these archaic laws have been fiercely resisted by the leaders of the religious organisations. They argue that the changes are a secular attack on the religious, but I challenge these fig leaves and postulate that they are defending the status quo where they are in positions of power and where they are free to discriminate at their fancy. They are like the clergy of the Dark Ages who rejected the Enlightenment and, in last-ditch efforts to stave off the march of progress, cried of doom and destruction. The predictions of the \\\"Dark Agers\\\" never came to pass and man began to flourish even more and so too will the hollow refrains of the ridiculous religious fall to nothing. Too often during debates on issues such as gay rights, the right to abortions and for contraception, we have people use the Bible, Hindu scriptures or the Qur'an as some form of basis for not granting these rights. It is necessary to point out that it is legal to hold these views, but these books and their postulations are not acceptable as legal justification for any law. Quite frankly, it is ludicrous that people will rage against any issue by using religion since there is no proof for religious dogma, as it is based completely on faith. It is also curious that those who seek to pressure policy to be based on religious doctrine have never thought out how dangerous this is for their own movement. A simple case will illustrate this; if law and policy were to be written on religious grounds, then should one religion gain prominence, say Hinduism Then if laws are written based on their tenets, the Muslims and Christians can bid goodbye to beef and Halal. It is then in the interest of all religions to be governed by a secular state. The rise of radical Islam in Iran and the subsequent brutal suppression of other religions, such as Christians, Sufi Islam and the Baha'i, show just how dangerous it is to live under a theocracy. I hope by now my point is becoming clear; this is not an attack on religion nor is it the ranting of a militant secularist. Instead, it is an appeal to some religious movements to allow the State to do its job, to allow the State to seek the interest of the people and the minorities who may not fall into the fold of the religious movement. There is a place for everyone in a secular state, a place for the religious, for the agnostics/atheists, for the GLBT movement, for the charities and for open discussion. Within the secular state, all can thrive and be protected and have rights; the protection and rights of one group does not erase or infringe on another. The world has changed and humanity has progressed; we are simply all one people of different ideals and ideologies but, at the end of the day, we are all human. The reign of religion and theology is over, the secular state is the vehicle of our progression and all are welcome. Rajiv Gopie won the President's Medal in 2006 for business/modern studies.

Far from being the sole domain of religion, blind faith is spreading in Trinidad and Tobago at a worrying pace. People are choosing to place their utter and absolute faith in politicians, religion, norms and education without thinking for themselves. Blind faith threatens to undermine our entire development project as it retards the development of the mind. Without freedom from mental slavery and blind belief, all of our money, resources and infrastructure will not deliver to us the future we hope for. It may seem odd to some that in this day of open technology, easily accessible information and more aware citizenry that I am writing about blind faith. We have to look just below the surface to see that beyond this facade of modernity, our society is festering with blind faith. Citizens who appear to be worldly or wise are, in fact, zombies without critical logic or minds of their own. We are facing an epidemic like no other, an epidemic which has swept though places like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and even the USA, to some degree. When I speak of blind faith, I am referring to the inability of our people to think critically and to question. In the face of glaring logical evidence, facts and figures, our citizens choose to turn a blind eye and continue to believe the falsehoods they have always clung to. Logical enquiry and empirics are only one part of thinking critically, the other is questioning, understanding and rejecting or accepting. For instance, all three major religions have customs and rituals that are followed on special occasions or as everyday routines. There are thousands of citizens who observe these rituals without knowing what they are doing or why they are doing it. Very few will question their religious leaders, and most times, even the so-called \\\"religious elite\\\" have no idea what they are doing. They will allude to custom and tradition, but custom and tradition also included slavery and human sacrifice, which we have rejected, so that is definitely not a good reason. Religion, it seems, is an easy target for those who would seek to highlight blind faith; in some ways, it is too easy and not the institutions that we should be concentrating on most, though it warrants investigation. Instead, I am seeking, in addition to religion, to focus on politics, education and norms. The ability to question, to think, to analyse and to reject is not an academic project that is only to be taught in school. It is a cultural ethic that stems from history, family and society. Our country has gone from a period of heightened awareness in the 1970s and early 1980s to a completely myopic and blind nation in the current age. Political awareness has sunk to new lows, and engagement in political affairs is continuing to decline. Far from only young people being unaware of politics, which has been observed across the world, the general population of T&T is not aware of what is going on. Lack of political awareness however pales in comparison to the blind faith that party supporters put in their leaders and their party. In Trinidad and Tobago, over the past 15 years, there has not been an election on issues such as economics, environment, freedom, trade, etc. It has always been about scandal, fete and, recently, crime. Citizens couldn't care less about issues, instead, they vote for their ethnic party or party of tradition. Despite the glaringly obvious pitiful state of parties, candidates or leaders, people continue to trust and support them. Laventille East and Caroni Central have been utterly neglected by their respective parties, but come election time, these two seats remain very safe by wide margins. This is just one example of how people are trapped when they place blind faith in parties. The harm and hurt affects only the people and not the political class. The neglect of these two seats and others will continue across the country as long as people trust blindly and do not demand better and ensure they get better. This may not be that they need to switch allegiances but rather they should seek to transform their parties of choice to properly represent their interest. The other sad state of blind faith is to be found in religion. Not faith as the belief in a supreme being or \\\"god\\\" but rather faith in doctrines and customs to the detriment of their own selves or our country. I begrudge no one belief in religion; I support religious freedom, tolerance and defend people's right to believe as they so see fit. What I cannot condone, however, is the blind faith that people put not in their religion or texts but in their leaders and man-written doctrines. Many believers in religion have not read their own religious texts; this is an accepted statement backed by proper research. Instead, the faithful rely on religious leaders to distill texts and \\\"educate\\\" them. Often, these same leaders have no idea what they are talking about and engage in behaviours their own religion finds deplorable. \\\"Judge not lest ye be judged,\\\" is a resounding theme across our three major religions, yet one has to only pick up a newspaper, look at television or listen to radio to hear an avalanche of judgment on all sorts of issues. Humility, love and kindness are also recurring themes, yet many religious leaders live in mansions while their congregations dwell in shacks, but once again, people accept and do not question. Let me make clear again; I have no problem with religion, what I have an issue with is religious hypocrisy and, more so, the blind thrust of the masses in these charlatans.

Today most organised societies have developed kinds or modes of clothing, employing a wide range of materials of natural and, more recently, synthetic origin. But while clothes have also in their evolution assumed deep cultural significance, norms of dress in many societies have changed over time. Yet many dress rules and traditions have been retained as they relate to a wide range of human activities including religion and the professions. Some societies such as ours often adopt the modes of dress of other cultures to give some sort of solemnity to special occasions. When our Parliament convenes for the first time the House Speaker and the Senate President are formally robed and bewigged, a ritual going back a few centuries in the United Kingdom. When we attend our places of worship everyone seems to know what is expected. When pre-school infants \\\"graduate\\\" they are usually dressed in colourful approximations of the mortar board and gown that date back to medieval times in Europe. Our culture seems to accept slowly changing norms as to what is appropriate attire and behaviour for the time, event or place but many would be shocked to read that a 40-year-old professional woman is being tried for wearing \\\"indecent clothing\\\"trousersat a coffee shop in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. She faces the prospect of 40 strokes if convicted! Had she walked the streets of Port of Spain she would hardly have been noticed amongst the great diversity of styles to be seen. Yes, it is true that there is a broad spectrum of what might be said to be Muslim dress to be seen in many parts of the world today. But at the same time there is no doubt that many members of that faith do not necessarily feel absolutely bound by dictates or conventions. Indeed, one can see across the entire Islamic world great diversity of dress, from places as far apart as Turkey and Indonesia. Religions have been an integral part of the evolution of societies and a powerful binding force, much of this through their core beliefs. But religions also reflect customs and laws of peoples, customs and laws that may have been appropriate for other, older times. In this unstable world of competing interests, conservatism continues as a force in all societieseven oursand extreme elements or groups often violently intervene in the hope of imposing their values, hence the upsurge in diverse societies such as Nigeria, Sudan and Iran.

I argued that as Trinidad and Tobago is a multicultural and multi-religious society in order for there to be harmony among our diverse peoples, it is necessary that we understand the philosophies and mores of each other, for ignorance breeds fear and mistrust. However, while we treat with some of the cultural differences in the curriculum in our schools, no fundamental instruction in each other's religious beliefs is given. Many of our young people do not appreciate the moral values held by our diverse faiths. I returned to this subject two years later in a series on reform of the education system (Express, December 2, 2004) and I then wrote: \\\"I will quote from a communication I received from a teacher of this subject in a secondary school in the United Kingdom. \\\"There are two possible pitfalls in a multicultural society: the one is to take the liberal view that 'all religions are fundamentally from the same source'. This denies integrity to members of a number of religions for whom commitment means a rejection of this notion. The other is to believe that there is no possible benefit from communication between human beings whose world views are fundamentally incompatible. This is clearly a recipe for social discord. For me the classroom is a microcosm of society, and in RE (Religious Education) lessons we try to establish a 'community of enquiry' into a number of world views, particularly religious ones, in order to test truth claims and give pupils the skills needed either to affirm already held beliefs or to search for themselves. It works because in such a community they are taught that relationships are more important than winning arguments, and being reasonable therefore means more than being rational. Sometimes people just have to agree to disagree, but can still show respect. This is not the same as accepting things which are against your belief, but it is acknowledging another person's right to choose, and your own responsibility to live in peace wherever possible.\\\" Religious Education and Civics (Citizenship) are compulsory subjects in the UK. How many of us in this country have good knowledge of each other's religious beliefs or a good knowledge of governance It was therefore with great interest that I learned of an initiative by the Trinidad and Tobago National Commission for UNESCO to mount a symposium and a workshop on Comparative Religion. The proposal for this initiative states in part that it is informed by a concern that, given the multicultural context of Trinidad and Tobago, and the apparent disintegration of peace and tolerance in the society, formal and non-formal education must facilitate not only an appreciation of cultural diversity but also of the diversity of religious beliefs. Further, such education must also foster recognition of the moral values held by our diverse faiths. It must engage our young people in the contemplation of a deeper meaning of life, in an understanding of the varied religious perspectives and it must support their spiritual development. The proposal further states that the Government envisages a society in which the diversity and creativity of all its people are valued and nurtured. The introduction of Comparative Religion in the school system offers one means of achieving this goal. This will require development of curricula and training of teachers. The objectives of the proposed introduction of Comparative Religion are to: 1.Develop respect for other religions, while remaining strong in one's own belief systems (which include atheism and agnosticism); 2.Expose students to different competing religious philosophies so as to foster tolerance and peaceful co-existence; 3.Promote a better appreciation of the tenets of other religious faiths and facilitate an understanding of the similarities among religions, for example similarity of moral issues; 4.Gather data and build consensus. A workshop will be held next week (October 5 and 6) for teachers and representatives of religious bodies at the Rudranath Capildeo Learning Resource Centre, Couva. The theme of the Workshop is: \\\"Harmony in diversity: Towards best practice for teaching World Religions\\\". On the first day the Keynote address will be given by Professor Anantanand Rambachan on the topic: \\\"International trends/current practices in teaching Comparative Religion: Impact and effectiveness of this teaching\\\". This will be followed by a Group discussion on the topic: Perspectives on approaching Comparative Religion in schools in Trinidad and Tobago. On the second day the Keynote address will be by Mrs. Grace Peart, Curriculum Officer, Jamaica on the topic : Curriculum Development and Implementation for Comparative Religion in Jamaica: A case study. TThis will be followed by an Open Forum on Curriculum Development and implementation for Comparative Religion. A Panel of Resource Persons will lead the discussion. Panelists: Grace Peart, Prof Anantanand Rambachan, Dr. Nasser Mustapha and Dr. Rev. Hazel Ann Gibbs De Peza.

Since then, it seems that Muslims worldwide have had to defend themselves verbally and yes, even physically.What some fail to see is that the actions of one group does not or should not cast a shadow on an entire community. Persons who follow Islam can be just as mindful, respectful, law-abiding and constructive as individuals of any other faith.In a world where it seems that morality and general self-respect are being seen as the new bad, just like others, Muslims too are striving to maintain order in their homes and guiding their children on the right path. Generally, women of all religions and cultures embrace similar ideals within their marital households. However, two local Muslim women, Amirah Bholai and Hanisha Karim, expressed their perspectives on what they saw as their responsibility as a woman of Islamic faith. I was curious about what aspect of Ramadan they looked forward to during the period of fasting; what Islamic lessons they sougt to teach their children; and what they considered to be a womans greatest role within her marital relationship.Bholai, is of African descent and is originally from Trinidad but migrated to and has spent most of her adult years in the United States. Twenty-three years ago, she converted to Islam and married a practising Muslim 16 years ago. As a Muslim woman, I ask Allah for forgiveness and strength to do better after Ramadan and in a way that is the same as we do during Ramadan. I teach my kids that in your time of need pray only to Allah for help.Being Muslim we should not go to a monk, priest, the obeah man or anyone else. I tell them make sure to pray five times a day. Life will be better. All the struggles and tests, when they come, be patient. The 40-year-old, who is mother to children aged 17 and 20 years, referred to wifely duties as she spoke in a manner that was more advisory. Cover your husband and dont talk bad about him to others. Be kind and understanding. Always talk things out with your husband. She continued, urging women, Do not lose yourself. Karim, an Indo-Trinidadian with a husband and three young children, grew up as a witness to the faith in her parents house. She expounded on her personal anticipation of this auspicious chapter of time within the Muslim community. Personally, I look forward to all of the togetherness, being one body at this time where you sometimes would not find it. Islam on the whole is not just a religion; it is a total way of life and we need to enforce that with our kids, so that they can become good citizens throughout their lives. For me, the biggest role for a woman, I think, is making sure that my kids do what I want them to do, the right and proper things. Karim offered inspiring words of wisdom to all. I believe that you should always do the right thing because parents are the first teachers for their children. This is not only with Muslims but all religions. It is always good to be a good Muslim. It is always good to be a good Christian. It is always good to be a good Hindu but it is always better to be a good human being. When asked her perspective on how on an international scale Muslims are feeling persecuted or being portrayed as perpetrators/instigators of heinous crimes, she commented, Religion is supposed to be a way of life that teaches people to have morals and values and to respect God and humanity. Metaphorically speaking, when someone gets into power or authority, for instance, politicians become swollen-headed and forget what the real reason being a politician is. Similarly, in every religion, there are extremists or fanatics and that shouldnt be. Sadly, there are people who enter Islam for the wrong reasons. Islam is a religion that means peace. Groups like with Boko Haram and ISIS are groups of fanatics with their own agenda, who misguide the world as to what Islam teaches. They believe they can force people to accept Islam, when in truth, Islam was never spread by the sword or force. What theyre doing is totally contrary to the beliefs and teachings of Islam and consequently, Muslims all over the world are looked upon as terrorists and dangerous people. nfpeters3434@gmail.com Wedding celebrations can sometimes feature some unusual and surprising traditions from countries all around the world, that we would consider to be extreme.

There are still many who will cross the street when they see them in prayer. For Archbishop Episcopus Barbara Gray-Burke, the painful memories remain, but the triumph of the freedom to worship is much sweeter. \\\"Every year we give God thanks for a new dawn.\\\" she says. \\\"At one time certain banks would not allow me to park [on their compound] even though I was a minister of religion,\\\" she recalled. \\\"I had members who could not go to work with their heads tied. At one stage your passport couldn't have you with your head tied. Nuns could have their picture taken with their heads tied, but we couldn't. I could go on and on. Now you could have your own marriage officers today.\\\" Burke added: \\\"We are glad for the freedom to worship God. [Our ancestors] went to prison only for worshpping God. Our plans for the future are to have a Baptist school to educate the young ones in our faith. We are looking forward to a primary school, secondary school and university.\\\" This year she celebrates in Maloney with a Thanksgiving service. It includes giving out awards including book presentations. Burke says she has given copies of the book to the National Library and the University of the West Indies so that young people will be able to understand the faith's relationship with God. She said: \\\"The rumours spread that we were obeah people. We are a faith and believe in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We are not obeah people. We are trying to correct all those myths and misconceptions.\\\" She describes the religion as being about service. Burke says she was elated upon hearing that March 30 was declared Spiritual Baptist Liberation Day and describes the day as one of reflection. \\\"It means a lot to [Baptists]. It means they have to reflect on the past, present and future, knowing that their ancestors preserved the faith for themfor all of usand now they are free to worship. Preservation of the faith, that is what is important to us.\\\" Although the attire may be different to other religions, Burke said members pray to God just like any other conformist church. \\\"We sing, we pray, we read the Bible, we clap, we shout. We are indigenous. There are goups all over the world.\\\" Burke quoted Psalm 100:1 of the King James Bible which states \\\"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.\\\" She continued: \\\"We believe too that men and brethren shout and bring down the walls of Jericho.\\\" From the years 1917 to 1951 the Spiritual and Shouter Baptist faith was officially banned in Trinidad by the colonial government of the day. The legislation to enact this ban, the Shouters Prohibition Ordinance, was passed on November 16, 1917. The reason given for the ordinance was that the Shouters made too much noise with their loud singing and bell ringing and disturbed the peace. Witnesses reported that during worship, participants danced, shouted, shook and fell to the ground in convulsions. Such behaviour was deemed unseemly by the more traditional and conservative elements in the society. Also, the established churches regarded such behaviour as heathen and barbaric. The police, who had been persecuting the Baptists for several years, also wanted them silenced. Worshipers were arrested, beaten and jailed if they were caught practising their religion. Like criminals, they had to flee to the hills and forests to practise their religion. Even then, the police still pursued and brutalised them. Nevertheless the Spiritual and Shouter Baptists survived. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Baptists fought many court battles and tried to counteract the negative perceptions of their faith. It was only when Tubal Uriah 'Buzz' Butler emerged as a labour leader that attitudes towards the Baptists gradually began to change. Butler himself was a devoted Baptist and controversial figure. His public meetings were reminiscent of a Baptist prayer meeting. His prominence gave the religion some legitimacy although he too was jailed for his political and religious beliefs. During the 1940s Grenadian-born Elton George Griffith campaigned to have the Prohibition Ordinance repealed. Under his leadership the numerous Independent Baptist churches formed the West Indian Evangelical Spiritual Baptist Faith. In 1940, as a united body, they presented a petition to the Legislative Council asking for the ordinance to be repealed. It was not granted but a few years later Albert Gomes asked the council to appoint a committee to look into a repeal of the 1917 ordinance. A committee was formed but it took several years before it released its findings. Meanwhile Griffith and his followers continued to lobby members of the Legislative Council to support the repeal. Finally, after much lobbying, the bill to repeal the ordinance was passed on March 30, 1951. The Spiritual and Shouter Baptists were free to practise their religion.

If you choose to belong to a certain faith, you are then obliged to follow the rules and traditions. You are free to leave the religion if you do not agree. To be a true believer is not to pick and choose what you personally prefer, or like or want. It means accepting, through faith, the teachings and traditions which have been adhered to for centuries.

With the Beetham landfill fires belching inescapable toxic fumes, oil spills polluting our coasts and smothering our wildlife, and devastating floods and landslides at the slightest rain, it is obvious that our islands are increasingly unable to sustain us. It is good that religious bodies and the Government recognise that Trinidad and Tobagos environment needs a miracle, but now that the prayers have been said, whats next T&Ts major religious denominations (Christianity, Hinduism and Islam) all call on believers to take responsibility for the earth and its creatures. The Bible is full of teachings that call upon Christians to fulfil their role and responsibility as caretakers or stewards to God, the rightful owner of the earth. Stewardship is a moral obligation and environmental destruction is the destruction of Gods creation. Hindus believe that the Divine is everywhere and we are not separate from nature. The Muslim holy book, the Quran, contains many verses that speak to environmental protection. The Islamic approach to the environment involves Tawhid, the unity principle; Fitra, the principle of the natural state; Mizan, the balance principle; and Khalifa, the responsibility principle. Internationally, many religious groups have issued a call to act on such environmental principles. The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC) is an international organisation bridging religion and the environment. Based in the UK, it was founded by His Royal Highness Prince Philip in 1995. ARCs aim, according to their website, is to assist the major religions of the world to develop environmental programmes based on their own core teachings, beliefs and practices. ARC works to help faiths turn their ecological teachings into action. Working with representatives of the worlds major faiths, they focus on developing long-term commitments for a living planet. These are faith-based commitments to environmental action to address pressing global environmental issues such as climate change. ARC has worked on projects that include transformation of a municipal rubbish dump to an urban green space, a green guide to Hajj, sacred sanctuaries for wildlife, reduction of soil erosion in the Sahara, Africa, and organic agriculture initiatives. Another inspirational organisation is GreenFaith, one of the most widely recognised religious, environmental organisations in the US. They have been hard at work since the 1990s, implementing programmes to address environmental issues. According to GreenFaith, for the religious community to make a difference to the environment, religious institutions and individuals must live out stewardship in everyday action. They provide congregations from multiple faiths with approaches to religious-environmental engagement. GreenFaiths programmes include energy conservation and the use of renewable energy in religious institutions, environmental health and justice programmes, and religious-environmental training programmes for clergy and layleaders. These international organisations demonstrate that faith-based action can help us achieve a cleaner, healthier environment. In T&T, many citizens are moved by a profound faith, but given the path we are on, prayer can only take us part of the way. The question remains: how do we turn our faith into a cleaner, greener, safer T&T It requires more than just a sermon here and there, a yearly tree-planting exercise or changing a few light bulbs. Our environmental problems are not easy fixes. They are ongoing, so the solutions have to be ongoing as well. If prayer alone can solve our problems, then prayers should include an urgent request for an improved human respiratory system that can breathe toxic fumes, a tough integumentary (skin) system to safely swim in waters that are about as clean as a toilet bowl and an improved human stomach that can digest toxins and plastics.

Can schools take the place of religious training institutions, and should school teachers take the place of religious experts Has the minister considered the mammoth and confusing task, coupled with the impracticability involved in such an undertaking Moreover, he seems to be assuming the \\\"strange\\\" role of high priest, imam, pundit or archbishop to mandate that his subordinates teach all religions to their children. Where are we heading as a nation with this approach Aren't we enjoying religious harmony already in this country In his address to the Hindu Students' Council of Trinidad and Tobago, the minister referred to \\\"a revised curriculum in religious education that mirrors the virtues and values of all the religious groups in our country.\\\" Whose brain-child is this Is there a hidden religious agenda here This is essentially syncretism (the combining of different religions, cultures and ways of thinking); so that this whole effort seems nothing more than the imposition of \\\"another religion\\\" on the nation, starting with our vulnerable and unsuspecting children. The wonderful \\\"pluralism\\\" of T&T implied in the minister's speech is likely to be seriously eroded as the classroom turns into a religious war-zone through the implementation of the proposed curriculum. That which is beautiful now at the cultural, social and academic levels could quickly turn into outright religious war in the classroom. The minister should be aware that religious sensitivities become more acute when one is forced to teach or listen to that which one does not believe in or find insulting to one's convictions. Worse, when a government provides an official platform for comparisons and contrasts of the nation's religions, what can be more divisive Everybody knows how deep religious sentiments run among any people, whether multicultural, multi-religious or not! What is the ontological basis of the so-called \\\"moral values held by our diverse faiths\\\" referred to by Prof John Spence How else can these moral values be sound except rooted in objective truth, that which is established by one Creator God Are they merely ideologies coming out of humanistic considerations or is there a standardised moral code from which they are drawn Which set of moral values should teachers persuade our children to embrace Which ones are right and which ones are wrong Prof Spence (one of my former UWI lecturers) is certainly not an expert in religion; I am surprised he is advocating this, if only partly on the basis of the information from a UK \\\"teacher on that subject\\\". I would have expected much more in-depth and insightful judgment on his part. He should note that a \\\"multicultural society\\\" is not the same as a religiously syncretic society, more like the agenda being pushed by the Minister of Education. This is where serious problems are likely to developwhere a kind of religious melting pot is imposed on the citizenry. Some serious questions have to be asked. How many religions will be covered in this \\\"revised curriculum\\\" What about denominational branches In Christianity, there are the Roman Catholics, the Episcopalian (Anglican), Moravian, Spiritual or Shouter Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh Day Adventists, Presbyterians and others. What about branches of Hinduism or Islam This comparative religion business is certainly not a matter for primary and secondary schools. This should be left to religious bodies. It will only create an extra burden on our pupils and unwarrantedly hamper their overall development. By the way, did the minister ban extra-curricular activities in schools to accommodate this \\\"religious\\\" agenda The type of religious education proposed, fraught with such dangers, could never be more beneficial to our children's education than extra-curricular activities. The issue is not one of \\\"ignorance\\\" as Dr Spence implies; it is about people's deep-seated religious convictions that cannot be dictated and mandated against. Then where is the integrity of our national anthem: \\\"Here every creed and race find an equal place\\\" Here is where the Prime Minister needs to overrule. \\\"Who is qualified to teach what\\\" Would a Christian teacher teach on Hinduism What would be the content of that teaching What would be the source of informationthe Gita or the Holy Bible Would teachers be guilty of offending pupils and their parents What about bias, disrespect and perceived or deliberate insults that could be hurled at other people's religions What about the workability of a belief or its unrealistic nature What about metaphysics and the question of ontology, causality, the philosophy of time, space or space time as conceptualised by different religions Will teachers teach on the \\\"nature of evidence\\\" and the \\\"critical experiment\\\" of a religious view that either verifies or falsifies a hypothesis or theory What a huge, confused and impractical curriculum this is likely to be, if it has to make sense or justify the paper and the time utilised for doing same!

According to an official document from a workshop held last week for teaching Comparative Religion, a key objective is to \\\"Develop respect for other religions, while remaining strong in one's own belief systems (which include atheism and agnosticism).\\\" In other words, teachers would have to lie about religion, and a lack of religion. However, for the few conscientious teachers who might teach this subject honestly, I have written a booklet comparing Trinidad's three main religions. Here's a short extract, complete with test questions: Comparing women: All religions agree that women must obey men, but differ in how to make this happen. The Bible says that if a woman is found not to be a virgin on her wedding night, \\\"the men of the city shall stone her with stones that she die\\\" (Deuteronomy 22:20-21). The Qur'an tells men that they're in charge of women and instructs \\\"from those whom you fear defiance, warn them and send them to a separate bed and whip them\\\" (surah 4, verse 34). And the Manusamhita decrees that \\\"In childhood a woman should be under her father's control, in youth under her husband's and, when her husband is dead, under her son's.\\\" Question What causes men to fear disobedience from a woman (a) beauty; (b) intelligence; (c) small penis. Crime comparisons: All religions are against crime, unless you're killing, robbing, or raping a believer of another religion. Then it's hunky-dory. So although the sixth commandment in the Bible says, \\\"Thou shalt not murder\\\", in Numbers 31:17-18 Yahweh tells Moses to order his followers to attack the Midianites and \\\"kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.\\\" Muslims, in their turn, value possessions more than limbs, so the Qur'an says, \\\"As for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands\\\" (5:38). In Hinduism, sitting can be a serious offence, and the Manusamhita states that \\\"If a man of inferior caste tries to sit in the same seat as man of superior caste, he should...have his buttocks cut off.\\\" Questions (a) Don't all women lie (b) Do only bisexual thieves get their hands chopped off (c) Can this punishment really be applied to flat-bottomed Indians Comparative peace: Apologists for all three religions claim they promote peace, which is why they never cite the following scriptures: in the Bible, \\\"Thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them (Deut. 7:2).\\\" In the Qur'an, \\\"Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful onto you: but it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you, and love a thing which is bad for you\\\" (2:216). And in the Bhagavadgita, \\\"One who is not driven by pride, whose mind is clear, though he kills men in this world, does not kill.\\\" Questions (a) If you smite someone, don't they get smitten (b) Is war like cheesecake (c) What is the psychological term for individuals who kill but believe they don't Comparatively sinful: All religions agree that some actions are absolutely wrong, though none mentions adding ketchup to eggs. For Muslims, the greatest sin is not to be Muslim, because \\\"Who does a greater evil than he who invents a lie against Allah and denies His revelations\\\" (6:21).The Bible takes a similar tack, with Leviticus 24:16 decreeing \\\"And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death.\\\" Hinduism, however, doesn't mind non-believers, once their noses aren't bigger than a Brahmin's. Question Is it a sin to eat devilled eggs Compare the facts: The facts taught to young people from religious texts would not often match the facts taught in other subjects. The Bible, for example, says that the human race started with two persons: Adam, who was created from dust (Genesis 2:7); and Eve, who was created from Adam's rib (Gen. 2: 21-22). The evidence from palaeontology, biochemistry, and genetics says that modern human beings evolved in Africa about 100,000 years ago. Another religious fact from the Qur'an is that mountains prevent earthquakes (16:15, 21:31), whereas geologists know that mountains are formed from tectonic, volcanic, and sedimentary forces. And, although biologists talk about larvae, the Manusamhita says that \\\"Mosquitoes and gnats, lice, flies, and maggots, and other species of this sort which originate from heat are born of sweat.\\\" Questions Should students believe God's word or man's science If the former, will they get extra marks, if the latter will they go to Hell If they go to Hell, will the heat make them sweat If it does, will their sweat breed mosquitoes, gnats, lice, flies, maggots, etc kbaldeosingh@hotmail.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Can schools take the place of religious training institutions, and should school teachers take the place of religious experts Has the minister considered the mammoth and confusing task, coupled with the impracticability involved in such an undertaking Moreover, he seems to be assuming the strange role of high priest, imam, pundit or archbishop to mandate that his subordinates teach all religions to their children. Where are we heading as a nation with this approach Arent we enjoying religious harmony already in this country In his address to the Hindu Students Council of Trinidad and Tobago, the minister referred to a revised curriculum in religious education that mirrors the virtues and values of all the religious groups in our country. Whose brain-child is this Is there a hidden religious agenda here This is essentially syncretism (the combining of different religions, cultures and ways of thinking); so that this whole effort seems nothing more than the imposition of another religion on the nation, starting with our vulnerable and unsuspecting children. The wonderful pluralism of T&T implied in the ministers speech is likely to be seriously eroded as the classroom turns into a religious war-zone through the implementation of the proposed curriculum. That which is beautiful now at the cultural, social and academic levels could quickly turn into outright religious war in the classroom. The minister should be aware that religious sensitivities become more acute when one is forced to teach or listen to that which one does not believe in or find insulting to ones convictions. Worse, when a government provides an official platform for comparisons and contrasts of the nations religions, what can be more divisive Everybody knows how deep religious sentiments run among any people, whether multicultural, multi-religious or not! What is the ontological basis of the so-called moral values held by our diverse faiths referred to by Prof John Spence How else can these moral values be sound except rooted in objective truth, that which is established by one Creator God Are they merely ideologies coming out of humanistic considerations or is there a standardised moral code from which they are drawn Which set of moral values should teachers persuade our children to embrace Which ones are right and which ones are wrong Prof Spence (one of my former UWI lecturers) is certainly not an expert in religion; I am surprised he is advocating this, if only partly on the basis of the information from a UK teacher on that subject. I would have expected much more in-depth and insightful judgment on his part. He should note that a multicultural society is not the same as a religiously syncretic society, more like the agenda being pushed by the Minister of Education. This is where serious problems are likely to developwhere a kind of religious melting pot is imposed on the citizenry. Some serious questions have to be asked. How many religions will be covered in this revised curriculum What about denominational branches In Christianity, there are the Roman Catholics, the Episcopalian (Anglican), Moravian, Spiritual or Shouter Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh Day Adventists, Presbyterians and others. What about branches of Hinduism or Islam This comparative religion business is certainly not a matter for primary and secondary schools. This should be left to religious bodies. It will only create an extra burden on our pupils and unwarrantedly hamper their overall development. By the way, did the minister ban extra-curricular activities in schools to accommodate this religious agenda The type of religious education proposed, fraught with such dangers, could never be more beneficial to our childrens education than extra-curricular activities. The issue is not one of ignorance as Dr Spence implies; it is about peoples deep-seated religious convictions that cannot be dictated and mandated against. Then where is the integrity of our national anthem: Here every creed and race find an equal place Here is where the Prime Minister needs to overrule. Who is qualified to teach what Would a Christian teacher teach on Hinduism What would be the content of that teaching What would be the source of informationthe Gita or the Holy Bible Would teachers be guilty of offending pupils and their parents What about bias, disrespect and perceived or deliberate insults that could be hurled at other peoples religions What about the workability of a belief or its unrealistic nature What about metaphysics and the question of ontology, causality, the philosophy of time, space or space time as conceptualised by different religions Will teachers teach on the nature of evidence and the critical experiment of a religious view that either verifies or falsifies a hypothesis or theory What a huge, confused and impractical curriculum this is likely to be, if it has to make sense or justify the paper and the time utilised for doing same!

Indeed it is in part that lack of knowledge of religions other than the one to which I adhere, knowledge which in my view should be acquired at school, that I support the teaching of religions in our schools. As promised in my last article I shall once again present some comments that I have made in previous articles and the views of a teacher of Religious Education (RE) in the United Kingdom where by law it is a compulsory subject. It seems appropriate to do so at this time when attention is focused on this issue. This teacher is from Trinidad and Tobago and has taught RE in the UK for over 20 years. He keeps in touch with this country by periodic visits. I quote: \\\"There are two possible pitfalls in a multicultural society: the one is to take the liberal view that 'all religions are fundamentally from the same source'. This denies integrity to members of a number of religions for whom commitment means a rejection of this notion. The other is to believe that there is no possible benefit from communication between human beings whose world views are fundamentally incompatible. This is clearly a recipe for social discord. For me the classroom is a microcosm of society, and in RE lessons we try to establish a 'community of enquiry' into a number of world views, particularly religious ones, in order to test truth claims and give pupils the skills needed either to affirm already held beliefs or to search for themselves. It works because in such a community they are taught that relationships are more important than winning arguments, and being reasonable therefore means more than being rational. Sometimes people just have to agree to disagree, but can still show respect. This is not the same as accepting things which are against your belief, but it is acknowledging another person's right to choose, and your own responsibility to live in peace wherever possible. We try and allow authentic representatives of different world views to have their say in a carefully constructed context, to avoid the accusation of indoctrination. (e.g. a Buddhist monk is asked to comment on the suffering of the holocaust, followed by a survivor of the holocaust and then by a Christian). The pupils devise the questions to be asked, and in the end give their own conclusions as to why there is suffering in the world. They are being asked to develop an approach to deal with whatever life throws at them, after hearing how others have overcome suffering. In the classroom I encourage a robust integrity and reasonable conflict based on relationships that can 'take the load'; this is better in the long run for society, rather than ignoring differences. A curriculum which denies a genuine spiritual search is in itself a form of indoctrination into agnosticism. Although agnosticism should be a legitimate world view, it should not be at the expense of true faith, and discussing faith should not be avoided because of potential trouble. This simply stores up more trouble than social relationships can cope with, leading to the breakdown of a multicultural society into warring factions\\\". \\\"The UK syllabus in Religious Education provides for spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the students. The sections on spiritual development help students to consider the meaning and purpose of life and values in human society. In the sections on moral development students use their understanding of religious and ethical teaching to consider areas of morality. In studies of social development students are assisted to develop a sense of identity and to be prepared for life as citizens in a multicultural, multi-religious society. In cultural development studies, issues within and between faiths are considered in order to develop an understanding of the cultural contexts in which they live. The students' awareness and understanding of a range of beliefs, practices and values in their own society and in the world are enhanced. This syllabus also promotes pupils personal, social and health education and citizenship. It deals with religious and moral beliefs and values that lead to beneficial social policies and practices (e.g. crime and punishment), and beneficial patterns of health (e.g. preventing the use of drugs). It looks at voluntary and charitable activities of individuals and organisations that help to make up a healthy democratic society. It contributes to social and political awareness (e.g. rights and responsibilities) and helps pupils to understand and respect people of different beliefs, races and cultures. RE provides opportunities for pupils to work together sharing ideas, discussing beliefs, values and practices and learning from each other. They may study particular topics such as Conservation of the Environment and discuss how each Faith addresses this issue\\\". Teaching RE can have a beneficial effect on the school population outside of the RE classes. Here are the comments on the teaching of RE at a school in the UK made by a review team that has done a detailed review of all facets of that school for the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED): \\\" Pupils are engaged in the lessons, express opinions and think for themselves. They are helped to analyse their opinions and those of others. The subject is made relevant to life today and pupils are engaged in big moral, social and philosophical questions such as justice, faith, love, care, trust and why we are here. Further, links have been made \\\"with a wide range of people from the faith communities including Christians, Jews, Muslims and Hindus to give a broad perspective on faith. People from these groups come into the school to add to the teachers' input in lessons. The subject (RE) makes a very good contribution to pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development\\\". It is my hope that the views expressed above will be of some use in the discussions on the introduction of RE into schools in this country\\\". John Spence is Professor Emeritus, UWI.

First of all, I wish to deal with the concept of morality as defined by the Cambridge English dictionary. Morality is defined as \\u201ca set of personal or social standards for good or bad behaviour\\u201d. It is important to recognise as indicated in that definition that there is personal morality and social morality. Personal morality is the moral belief system you hold yourself to as an individual while social morality stems from the general belief system embraced collectively as a community/nation. This difference in morality arises from the simple fact that in most coun\\u00adtries, their citizens come from different religious persuasions, diffe\\u00adrent ethnicities, different political views and different social classes. The religious aspect can be further dissected as there are people who do not subscribe to any religion, some subscribe to agnostic beliefs while others are atheist and humanist. The morality you hold for yourself, in essence, comes from and is influenced by your religious persuasion/non-religious persuasion, political views and your social standing. The social morality we espouse is mostly dictated by our political system, that is, the fact that we live in a democracy. However, the personal morality, which is the most prominent, is mostly influenced by what religious views our parents imparted to us as children. Our personal morality is then further shaped by our decisions as adults, that is, whether we choose to embrace a religion diffe\\u00adrent from our parents or whether we choose no religion and instead embrace agnosticism, atheism or humanist ideology. I say this all to highlight the obvi\\u00adous\\u2014that no two persons in a multireligious, multi-ethnic demo\\u00adcracy such as Trinidad and Tobago will have the exact same personal moral code. Rev Dash then went on to make this most interesting statement: \\u201cThe culture of a people should not be allowed to take them away from the true, living God.\\u201d I found that statement to be quite astounding for seve\\u00adral reasons. In a multireligious society such as ours, which of the religions ascribe to the true, living God Is it the Muslims Hindus Catholics Pentecostals Secondly, Rev Dash cannot compel any\\u00adone living in democra\\u00adtic Tri\\u00adni\\u00addad and Tobago to subscribe to a religion. Just as he has the right to practise his religion freely without fear of persecution, it is the right of the agnostic or the atheist to not subscribe to any religion. I believe this entire fiasco with the former mayor could have been avoided if people understood this very basic concept. Trinidad and Tobago is a democracy, and a republic at that. It is the right of any citizen to frown upon and avoid anything that he/she perceives to be contradictory to their personal morality. No one, and that includes a mayor, pastor, pundit, imam, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, agnostic or atheist, has the right to impose their concept of mora\\u00adlity on another citizen. They also do not have the right to try to prevent any citizen from doing anything that they are comfortable doing and which they feel does not conflict with their own moral code. Some religious people have gone so far as to complain that people who participate in Carnival shut down Port of Spain for two days. Interestingly enough, they make no mention of the seven or so religious holidays which shut down the country throughout the year and inconveniences non-religious people or people who are not of their religious persuasion. Such is the nature of democracy, and it cannot be any other way. Any time we start going down the road of dictating to anyone what they can and cannot do based on our religious concept of morality, is to lead the way to dictating to people what religion they ought to be in or dictating that they ought to have a religion in the first place, notwithstanding any reservations to such. History is replete with examples of the disastrous consequences of such attempts, such as the long, bloody Catholic/Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland. I, for one, have no intention of surrendering my personal morality to the whims and fancy of a zealot, especially since I am one of those who abandoned the religion of my parents and opted for the ideology of the agnostic. But that is my constitutional right as is granted in the democratic republic of Trinidad and Tobago.

Freedom of religion is an enshrined constitutional right and an extremely sensitive issue to many. We have found a unique and exemplary way to live among our fellow citizens of different faiths. In most other countries, a population as diverse in race, culture and religion like ours would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to govern. We have achieved something that is admired the world over and we have achieved it without anyone from the Education Ministry ever mandating to schools that they must teach about other religions. A Hindu teacher teaching Hindu children in a Hindu school about Hinduism is quite different from a Pentecostal teacher teaching Christian children in a Christian school about Hinduism. Naturally, the Hindu teacher teaching Christian doctrines would be biased and stymied by his own personal convictions, and vice versa. One of the Christian and Islamic beliefs and teachings about Hinduism is that it is pagan, demonic, polytheistic and evil. The Minister should leave that hornets' nest alone!

Dr Gopeesingh created a perhaps unnecessary furore by the vague and off-the-cuff manner in which he announced, in advance of the consultation on curriculum due to have started yesterday, that religious education would be made mandatory in all schools. \\\"In the reviewed curriculum, all schools, whether they are government, government-assisted, which are denominational or private, will be mandated to teach about religious education as part of their timetable,\\\" said the Education Minister at a Hindu students' conference last Sunday, emphasising, \\\"So we want to teach about religious education, and not religious education there is a difference.\\\" He should have explained that difference. Dr Gopeesingh could not have actually meant \\\"teach about religious education\\\", since this means teaching about how religion is taught.

While it is true that the Education Ministry regulates private educational institutions, this is only to the extent of ensuring that certain pedagogical standards are met, such as having qualified teachers. The inclusion of private schools in this mandate implies that the Government considers learning about religion to be as indispensable for education as, say, English Language, Mathematics and Science. The proposed imposition on denominational schools, founded specifically to foster their own religions, will also very likely lead to conflict. At present, these schools do not directly impose their beliefs on students who don't belong to their faith, but this does not mean the schools would want their core students being taught about other religions, although a Catholic spokesperson yesterday appeared to welcome the teaching of comparative religion. On its website, the Ministry states that the curriculum for Comparative Religion \\\"must be based on an understanding of the norms and values of our society and grounded in the lives of our communities.\\\" This begs the question as to whether different religions have different norms and values, and also assumes that such values can undergird, rather than undermine, the quest to build a nation out of diverse traditions. It may be that all these issues will be addressed in the stakeholders conference which ends today.

The 40-year-old professional has a boyfriend, who doesn't know about her secret habit. \\\"I'm not into girl-on-girl action, that's boring. I'm into hetero stufftwo guys and a girl. That's a fantasy of mine.\\\" The ex-Convent girl said she started out reading Playboy and Penthouse as a teen, and had seen some of the older movies, including classics like Deep Throat. \\\"I was always curious about sex. And back then I wasn't doing anything (sex-wise), just fooling around. That's how I would learn about it, reading articles in magazines. It was research, this was something I planned to do and I wanted to get it right.\\\" At Convent Kelly-Ann didn't talk to the other girls about sex. \\\"That was not the kind of conversation we would have,\\\" she shrugged. Then she went to UWI, and started having sex, \\\"so I would watch porn and learn tricks to put into practice\\\". She still enjoys reading erotica, mostly written by women for women because \\\"it comes at sex from a whole different angle\\\". Most porn videos are made by men, she pointed out. \\\"Porn is mainstream now anyway,\\\" Kelly-Ann insisted. Well, in the US and Europe anyway, with rappers making music videos that are basically softcore porn; and a few even doing hardcore versions. However, she had to admit, her liking for porn was \\\"not something I would disclose to everybody\\\". \\\"We are a society that is uncomfortable with the idea of discussing sex,\\\" says Salorn McDonald of Population Services International (PSI), an organisation that is trying to change the high-risk sexual behaviour that many Trinbagonians engage in. As the regional behaviour change communications manager for PSI, McDonald has seen and heard a lot in his research. \\\"You have old men bragging about contracting STIs (sexually transmitted infections) back in their heyday,\\\" he exclaimed. \\\"Back then it was a source of pride to get 'runnings'. They show you their old, beat-up, green clinic card, as if getting it made them a man. They don't tell you about the burning sensation when you pee and not being able to walk properly after a shot of penicillin. \\\"We have to remove the mystique and mystery from sex. This is what creates that appetite to explore. We need to make this a normal part of our upbringing, then it becomes a healthy understanding of life and ourselves.\\\" Where does this publicly prudish attitude (except at Carnival) come from Is it because we were a British colony \\\"It goes deeper than that,\\\" McDonald contends. Many people tend to use a faith-based approach to raising children, he said, be it Christianity, Islam, Hinduism or Rastafarianism. And this means sex is portrayed as something that should not be talked about. \\\"We ingrain this into our children and that creates a situation where there is no exploration of sexual appetite, and discussing sex is immoral. The idea of having young people discuss sex is not to be done.\\\" Worse, it does not equip our children for a world inhabited by sexual predators. Young girls with no knowledge of sex or feelings are fooled into having sex with the first person who tells them \\\"I love you\\\". All of this could be avoided if, God forbid, children were exposed to information about sex and sexuality at an early age, says McDonald. He has visited countries such as Switzerland, Sweden and Holland, where there is clear evidence that education about the birds and the bees has helped to reduce teenage pregnancy and the incidence of \\\"VD\\\" (venereal disease). Even in England, sex education is to be taught in schools. In October, Schools Minister Jim Knight announced that sex education would be added to the national curriculum including kindergartens. The English have had no choice but to confront distressing figures such as 39,000 girls between ages 15 and 17 becoming pregnant in 2006, plus another 7,200 girls between the ages of 13 and 14. \\\"It's vital that this information doesn't come from playground rumour or the mixed messages from the media about sex,\\\" Knight said. Currently, English schools are only required to teach basic lessons on reproduction as part of the science curriculum. Now they will have to provide lessons on relationships and contraception, with the lessons becoming more sophisticated as the children get older. Elementary schools can offer lessons in naming body parts, preparing for puberty and relationship feelings, Knight said. At the very earliest, sex education will mainly be about self-awareness, he said. \\\"We are not talking about five-year-old kids being taught sex. What we're talking about is children knowing about themselves, their differences, their friendships and how to manage their feelings.\\\" In Trinidad and Tobago we still teach a vague introduction to public health and hygiene in school that dates way back, McDonald said with exasperation. The absence of proper sex education in schools is not serving children in any way. \\\"It's not helping young people to understand themselves and what happens to their bodies,\\\" he said. And burying our heads in the sand is not going to make resulting problems, like porn addiction, go away. To be a fine, upstanding member of this society, says McDonald, one does not discuss matters like sex. And this belief is especially strong among the elders. \\\"They say what seems to be the correct thing,\\\" he noted, \\\"rather than saying or doing the important thingwhat is necessary.\\\" Do you think sex education is the answer to addressing problems like porn addiction Tell us with you think.

The atheist buses are all over London and some other big British cities by now, with a large ad running down the sides saying: \\\"There is probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.'' But you have to ask: if the sponsors of the ad, the British Humanist Society, felt strongly enough about it to spend 35,000 (US$50,000) to put the signs on all those buses, why did they only say \\\"probably no God'' It's not their fault. Tim Bleakley, managing director for sales and marketing at CBS Outdoor in London, which handles advertising for the bus system, explained that advertisements saying flatly that there is no God \\\"would have been misleading'' for religious people. \\\"So as not to fall foul of the code, you have to acknowledge that there is a gray area.'' When the complaints rolled in anyway, alleging that the ad was offensive to Christians and that the \\\"no God'' claim could not be substantiated, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the ads were \\\"an expression of the advertiser's opinion and that the claims in it were not capable of objective substantiation.\\\" For a non-theological organisation, the ASA is pretty sharp. Never mind all that. The real question is: what did the British Humanist Society think it would achieve with its ad campaign It's not as though non-believers in Britain were an oppressed minority. In fact, they're not a minority at all. They are the majority, although you have to read the statistics carefully to realise that. According to the 2001 census, only seven million people in Britain said they had no religion, while 37 million said they were Christian. 1.5 million were Muslim, half a million were Hindu, 390,000 were Jedi Knights (there was a conspiracy among younger Britons to mock the process by claiming allegiance to the religion of Star Wars), 329,000 were Sikhs and 260,000 were Jewish. Those numbers suggest that Britain is an overwhelmingly Christian country, with under 20 per cent of the population non-believers. Yet three-quarters of the people in Britain do not go to church even once a year. On an average Sunday only six per cent of the population is in church, and that figure has been dropping at two per cent per decade since the 1970s. Something doesn't add up here. When the International Social Survey Programme conducted a more in-depth study of religious belief almost 20 years ago (1991 and 1993), it asked people if they agreed or disagreed with the statement \\\"I know God exists and I have no doubts about it.'' In Britain, only 23.8 per cent of people said they agreed. That's a normal number for Europe. In that ISSP poll, most European countries only registered between 20 and 30 per cent for confident belief in God, although Italy struggled up to 51 per cent, Ireland reached 58 per cent and Poland got the prize with 66 per cent believers. What is happening is that people in Britain and many other countries are answering the census question about religion in terms of their cultural heritage (which is, in most cases, Christian), not of their actual beliefs. It all depends on how you phrase the question, but the official figures are misleading. Actual levels of religious belief in Europe are very low. Moreover, the collapse in belief is continuing, with the youngest least likely to identify with a religion. A MORI poll commissioned by the British Library in 2007 found that nearly half of teenagers in Britain were atheists. This fits in better with what you actually observe from day to day in most European countries. People are no less moral than they ever were, but religion is simply absent in daily life in Europe, at least compared to the United States, where it seems omnipresent. Yet here's a strange thing: the very first place those bus ads came out was the United States. The idea started in Britain, but the American Humanists moved faster. Their ads appeared on buses in Washington, DC, in November, saying \\\"Why believe in a god Just be good for goodness' sake''and there was little public outcry. Maybe the United States is not that different after all. The United States, we are constantly told, has a level of religious belief almost as high as Iran's, and every Gallup poll since 1944 has reported that at least 94 per cent of Americans \\\"believe in God or a universal spirit.'' But look at that question. If you had any lingering guilt at all about having abandoned your ancestral religion, you'd say yes to that, wouldn't you When the ISSP asked its much more rigorous question, only 66 per cent of Americans agreed with the statement, \\\"I know God exists and I have no doubts about it.'' That was almost 20 years ago, and it's very likely that the level of belief has fallen since. The United States is not the same as Europe, but it is not invulnerable to the same trends. Which may be why President Obama, while rhyming off the roll-call of America's religions in the time-honoured fashion in his election-night acceptance speech, for the first time added \\\"and non-believers.''

Disparaging the sixth-form pupil to a class, the teacher reportedly stated that: \\u201cThe beginning of the story is he has two parents who should not be parents, they are screw-ups, they are atheists, they do not believe in God. You see me, give me a gun and I will fix all the problems in the world. I will shoot both of them first and then their offspring.\\u201d That the teacher thinks atheists and homosexuals deserve to be killed reveals the kind of fanaticism religious beliefs can engender in otherwise normal persons, which has been acted out most prominently by jihadists around the world and, in 1990, right here in Trinidad and Tobago. As an organisation which has a high proportion of atheists and agnostics, we must note that the teacher's view that persons who do not believe in God are unfit to be parents is not borne out by the research. While there are no data for T&T, surveys in other societies show that atheist parents, far more than religious ones, typically impart to their children at least one of the virtues listed in the national motto: tolerance. Indeed, whereas religious parents invariably indoctrinate their children into their beliefs, atheist parents mostly leave it up to their children to choose their own paths and often actively expose them to different belief systems. Although their children usually end up non-religious, that is probably because atheist parents tend to teach their children to think for themselves and to be ethical in their choices. That makes it less likely that they will adhere to religious beliefs or religion-based morality. As for outcomes, it is worth noting that, in T&T's jails all religions are over-represented or on par with the general populace, except Hindus and Presbyterians who are under-represented.

What is interesting, however, is that people in T&T tend to be culturally religious and not religious at all. This may sound confusing but I will explain what I mean. Religion, defined as a set of principles and beliefs, has governed human existence for a number of years. With religion there is usually a divine being or beings, that is God or gods. Within religion a number of rules and norms have been established that come to define what is acceptable behaviour, how the world is to be seen and how one in general should perceive things. The great or major religions are Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism, but the teachings of these religions are much more than how to pray and who to believe in. They are ways of life and behaviour. Queue Trinidad and Tobago, the land of multiculturalism, many religions, peoples, traditions and backgrounds. The melting pot of the Caribbean, where thankfully at the moment there exists little or no religious strife. In our beautiful country, though, when most people align themselves with a religion, they do so in a very narrow sense. They have adhered to some of the ritual actions and belief systems of their respective religions but for the most part they have abandoned the moral, social and mental aspects of their faith. A case in point is our wonderful Carnival season where our people revel in the things of the world and its \\\"vices\\\". For the average person this is not a scandal or anything to be afraid of; it is Carnival and Carnival is in our blood as a people. It would be interesting to know that the major religions condemn to no end and religious societies forbid the behaviour and very idea of Carnival. The same people who are chipping down the street on Carnival day three-quarter naked will not think twice of praying before they go to bed and in most cases going to church. We as a society see nothing wrong with this. Another great example in our unique country is where different religions cross and intermingle. Muslims go to Hindu prayer services, Catholics to Muslim functions and all the like. One would recall when the Honourable Mr Jack Warner took part in a Hindu prayer service the Archbishop gave an opinion that condemned it and cited some obscure teaching that calls for no religious mixing. What the Archbishop did not know is that in our country those rules forbidding mixing and cross-religious participation have been thrown out the window. What has resulted from this is a religiously tolerant society, unlike places like India where Hindus and Muslims kill each other or Lebanon where Muslim and Christian militias would gladly kill each other over religion. I am hoping that my point about being culturally religious is coming across now. It is no more greatly demonstrated than in the Hindu population who have adhered to Indian/Hindu culture but abandoned many of the teachings of the Hindu religion. The caste system has been thrown out the window but the saris and kurtas still remain. The temples and Divali still remain but many of the rules governing male/female interaction, many Hindu teachings about eating meat and consuming alcohol have been tossed out and family and culture have come to replace the teachings of Hinduism. The same goes for my Muslim brethren who have demonstrated great faith to their religious values in terms of beliefs but have thrown the behaviour and societal controls involving male/female interaction etc out the window. This is not to say that people do not \\\"read their bible and pray every day\\\". I am not denying that. What I am advocating, however, is that people skip over the part dealing with not eating a cloven-footed animal (that is pork) as they love their pork too much, and the part calling for the honouring of the Sabbath, that is, no work on a Sunday, is thrown out the window also. These things may seem minute and \\\"normal\\\" but they are in fact betrayals of what a religion entails. In countries where religion actually holds sway these things are honoured to a tee. In our blessed country, politics has not been tainted by religion that much. When compared to a place like the US, believe it or not, we are a highly developed non-religious democracy. The religious and moral beliefs of a candidate or a party mean nothing to us as we are not religious like the Christian right wing in the US. We are indeed much closer to Western Europe who have thrown religion out the window a very long time ago. What is also interesting about Western Europe is that in the majority of countries the majority of the population do not identify with a religion and are either atheist (do not believe in God) or agnostic (God cannot be proved or disproved so they are sceptical of religion and have none). Is Trinidad and Tobago heading towards a fully secular non-religious society One cannot be sure. It may be hard now to imagine our country devoid of religious people but this is actually where we are trending. A large swath of the younger generation has thrown religion completely out the window. Some are atheists and agnostics and some still say they are religious, but in name only. This does not mean that we have no morals and values. All it means is that we will do good not to go to heaven but because we wish to do it and help our fellow human beings. The world is becoming more secular as religion declines. Trinidad and Tobago is already ahead of its time. Let us hope it will continue. Rajiv Gopie won the President's Medal for business studies/modern studies in 2006.

But, according to psychological studies, this will be achieved only if the students become less religious. And, if RE makes more people more religious, crime and corruption in Trinidad and Tobago may get worse. This is not the view of the country's present Prime Minister, however. When she was Minister of Education in the UNC administration 15 years ago, Kamla Persad-Bissessar told the audience at an ASJA fund-raising function: \\\"There is a fair amount of empirical evidence that points to the contribution that religion makes to healthy human development, especially in the development of the young.\\\" But in their book Atheists, North American psychologists Bruce Hunsberger and Bob Altemeyer cite their research which found that, the more religious people were, the more narrow-minded they became. \\\"As religiosity ranges from 0 to 100, so will dogmatism, zealotry, authoritarianism, and prejudice generally increase,\\\" they write. Their studies encompassed Canadians and Americans who went to church regularly and those who went only occasionally. Non-believers scored lowest on this list of undesirable traits. However, psychologist David G Myers, whose psychology textbooks are widely used in American universities, says the opposite in his book A Friendly Letter to Skeptics and Atheists. \\\"In nearly every one of more than two dozen studies, faithful church attenders exhibited less prejudice than irregular attenders,\\\" Myers writes. \\\"...it seems that, among the churched, the devout exhibit less prejudice and deeper feelings of human kinship that the nominally religious, who are somewhat more likely to rationalise prejudice with the aid of religion.\\\" In Trinidad and Tobago, religion is also seen as a key to academic success. Religious leaders continually claim that it is the religious character of the denominational schools which account for them producing most of the top 100 SEA students and taking the lion's share of CSEC scholarships. Maha Sabha head Sat Maharaj, for example, in a 2007 article in the Trinidad Guardian wrote: \\\"A successful education system must, therefore, provide for the cultural and religious needs of the children. Lack of State subventions for priests, pundits, and imams to teach religious values must impact negatively, especially at the state schools.\\\" However, at the formal opening of a national consultation on the primary school curriculum on April 5, Education Minister Tim Gopeesingh noted, \\\"The denomination boards cream the top and put them into their so-called prestige schools, so they must get better results at CSEC, CXC. So you only get good results at CXC and CSEC because you have the best students coming to your school.\\\" Other factors may be more pertinent to the academic performance of these schools. Criminologist Ramesh Deosaran has done research showing that the majority of students in the \\\"prestige schools\\\" come from two-parent families which are mostly upper- and middle-class. (See Table 1.) Studies show that these factors are more relevant than a religious upbringing to doing well in school and avoiding serious juvenile delinquency. Moreover, studies in other countries have consistently shown a negative correlation between IQ or education and religiosityi.e. the higher people's IQ or educational attainments, the less likely they are to be religious. For example, a 1996 study by psychologists EJ Larson and L Witham showed that over two-thirds of the most eminent American scientists do not believe in God or an afterlife, as compared to a mere ten per cent of the general American populace who also rejected such beliefs. Table 2 shows the religious affiliations of UWI students at the St Augustine campus, compared to their respective proportions in the wider population. The percentage of students who did not state their religion is twice that of the general populace (or seven times that of the national census who put \\\"None\\\").

That is why many people of different religious persuasions recognise the need for a secular state to ensure that the state does not promote one religion over another or discriminate against any particular creed. Many of us like to think that in Trinidad and Tobago every creed and race has an equal place and were quite surprised to hear the Prime Minister declare that born-again Christians were being persecuted in modern T&T. It is reasonable to expect the major religions of our country to work together to promote religious tolerance and racial harmony. The four largest religions in the world (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Judaism) are all monotheist. That is to say they all believe in one God. In Hinduism God may have many manifestations and in Catholicism there may be three persons in one God, but they all believe there is only one God. I am most certainly not an expert in religion but I am willing to accept that this one God is one and the same for all religions. For that reason I believe it is important to respect the beliefs of others and not denigrate or discriminate against other religions. Unfortunately although religion is supposed to be a force for good it has been used over the centuries to provoke differences, justify wars and promote atrocities. Nobody needs to be an expert in religion or history to be aware of the very numerous acts of persecution in the name of religion and the massacres that have been perpetrated in the name of the true God. The Crusades and the Inquisition are but two examples of violence in the name of religion. And of course views change over time so Joan of Arc can be burnt as a heretic and later canonised as a saint. It is unfortunately true that many leaders, for their own misguided reasons, have played on the fears of the ignorant to divide people against each other. Many acts of religious violence are committed within a broad faith e.g. Catholics against Protestants, Shi'ites against Sunnis and so you can see tolerance as a goal is not something universally achieved. My platitude that every religion believes in the same God, is about as hopeful as wishing for racial harmony because all races are human. Trinidad and Tobago has had its share of religious discrimination and persecution. The colonial powers of Spain, France and England that populated Trinidad were largely Christian and the State was not secular. It took a long time for other religions to be tolerated and in acknowledgement of that a public holiday was declared to recognise the struggle of Shouter Baptists. That holiday (yesterday) should have been a good time for us all to reflect on the need for tolerance and respect for all religions including Full Gospel born-again Christians. I am not calling for a public holiday for them, however, because we have far too many already and also I do not believe there is one iota of evidence of religious persecution against any groups in T&T today. Quite honestly we need to reduce the number of holidays and having holidays for Christians, Hindus, Muslims and Baptists is not necessary in the name of religious tolerance and may be detrimental to productivity. Even if there is no evidence of persecution against any religion in T&T today we must remain vigilant to ensure it stays that way. Persecution is not far behind discrimination and intolerance and it would be an exaggeration to say that Trinidad is a tolerant society in which there is no religious discrimination. It is very much up to our religious leaders to teach their followers the virtues of tolerance and to ensure the state does not enforce religious customs on the population. We must also be vigilant to ensure that religion is able to preserve its independence from politics. Politicians are not beyond using religious differences to seek their own ends. The creation of public holidays and the granting of land or other favours to religious groups in the expectation of political support is not far from overt corruption. It is reasonable to seek to support politicians and parties that show strong moral values and integrity. But ask yourself this. Does it matter what religious beliefs any Prime Minister has in this plural society Does it matter to you if he is Hindu, Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Muslim, Southern Baptist, Shouter Baptist or even agnostic or atheist If it does, ask yourself why. Should it not be enough that our leaders have strong moral values and principles, leaving religion entirely separate It is very important to the future harmony of our multi-cultural, multi-racial and multi-religious society that we remain tolerant and the State remains secular. We must not allow our differences to be used against us as we work for a better T&T.

Colombia, Jamaica, Venezuela, Mexico, South Africa countries with the highest crime rates in the world, more than 80 per cent of the people are religious. LAST week, when I read there was some lunacy being floated around that religion was going to be taught in schools, I almost blew a gasket. I started to write my column only to realise it was being driven by disbelief and anger and not by logic, facts, figures and academic proof which are what I base my columns on. I cooled off, decided to read the arguments of the proponents and then respond rationally. Examine the above data from the United Nations Criminal Justice Information Network, the CIA World Factbook and various national statistical agencies. Look closely at the countries that have the lowest crime rates and what does one notice Then look at those with the worst crime rates. What does one notice Yes, you are right the most religious countries are the worst in terms of crime, whilst the lowest crime rates exist in countries that have large numbers of non-religious people atheists and agnostics. I read an interesting argument that T&T is experiencing a high murder rate because of moral and social decay and in some odd way this is connected to lack of religious education! Is anyone as confused as I am To tell me that teaching religious studies in school is going to lessen crime is the equivalent of saying prayer will heal cancer and HIV. Well it has not and it is not going to. Schools are supposed to be bastions of wisdom, places where facts, figures, science, history and truth reign supreme. Not places for children to learn about stories from books that have been proven wrong so many times one wonders why revised editions have not been put out. Do not get me wrong. Religious tolerance is a worthy trait and should be instilled. But this should be done through the teaching of the social sciences, history and philosophy; through theological studies that dissect and analyse and many cases disprove religious theories. Not through forcing children to listen to people yap for hours about things that have no factual basis. Religious tolerance needs to be fostered though everyday interaction, cultural shows, exhibitions in school libraries etc, Not by forcing kids to zone out and they will zone out for an hour or so a week. If anything, kids will get more dismissive; if it is one thing that all people but more so children hate, it is to be forced to do anything. What about the non-believers, the atheists and the agnostics What will happen to them I know as a humanist/agnostic myself, if someone had tried to teach me religion in secondary school I would have been thrown out of class more times than I was, because I would argue endlessly. But what about the other students not like me who will sit there in discomfort for hours, being told stories that belief in some form or another of God(s) is the way to heaven One may ask, how many non-believers are there in secondary school Well, I interact with secondary school pupils online a lot. Any sample would show that while many are nominal members of some religion, most could not care less and believe even less. If you do not believe me ask a teenager if they really believe in what their religion says, the stories and myths. Be prepared for a surprise. They may say they are Hindu/Muslim/Christian, but only in name; they do not adhere to or believe most of what those religions teach. What exactly is going to be taught Is it a cursory review of the major religions Is it their principles, because the principles of two of the largest Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity) in our country are fundamentally incompatible with the Kumbaya notion being peddled in the articles I read. Those religions state that there is only one God their God, there is only one way their way and others will be cast to hell and fire and brimstone and so on. Is this what 14-year-olds are going to be told Which religions are going to be taught There are many minorities in T&T including some Kabir Panth, Baha'i, Baptists and Jews. Are their faiths going to be taught What of some of the lovely passages from those good books Are the homophobic ones going to be mentioned How will the gay/bisexual and lesbian youngsters feel The passages that call for the stoning of disobedient children, the ones that call people infidels, the one that says kill the Jew under the rock, the one that says fire will come to burn those who do not believe We would like some answers. School is for advancement, not fairy tales. It has been proven time and time again that as education increases, religion decreases, development increases and crime decreases. The teaching of religion is best left to the home and to the society that must demonstrate the values they preach. It makes no sense to have children learn about religion and then the imams, pastors and pundits go lambasting other faiths and either calling for them to repent, convert or be prepared for hell. What should be thought in school is knowledge grounded in facts and reality. With this knowledge comes power and this power crushes the illusion of religion. From this only good things come forth.

Maybe the organisers find that I stake religious beliefs too often in my writing. Nonetheless, since I know more about religion than religious leaders in Trinidad and Tobago, I feel I have an intellectual obligation to put in my two cents' worth. And, after hearing Education Minister Tim Gopeesingh's rationale for this new policy, I figure that figure is just about right. According to Dr Gopeesingh, the Ministry wants \\\"a revised curriculum that mirrors the virtues and values of all the religious groups in the country\\\". But if religion were taught like a proper subject, such as Science, then it wouldn't be a mirror of virtues. Physics teachers don't tell students they should believe Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism because James Maxwell was a teetotaller, and Biology teachers don't argue that evolution is a fact because Charles Darwin never horned his wife. Teaching Religion as it is actually practised here would mean teaching young people how to take money under false pretences such as healing the sick, preventing crime, and stopping hurricanes. (Many students already know how to fornicate while saying \\\"Oh God\\\".) So if Religion is to be a subject which reflects virtue, then English Language teachers would first be required to teach their students a new meaning of the word \\\"virtue\\\". After all, if nine-year-old school girls are told the age of the Prophet Muhammad's fourth wife, Aisha, they would probably go \\\"Ewww!\\\", indicating that their idea of virtue is different from Muslim scholars', who explain that it was a great honour for Aisha to be chosen by the 53-year-old Muhammad. Now all schools, and not just Muslim ones, will be teaching girls to be ambitious from small, since even a nine-year-old can cook, sweep, and marry their grandfather's friend. This value of women is also backed up in Christianity and Hinduism, since Corinthians 11:9 says \\\"Neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man\\\" while the Bhagavadgita says that women are of \\\"lower birth\\\". Teachers could explain that this doesn't mean women were made to serve man, as a common sense interpretation of these words would suggest, but only that men need someone to wash their clothes. The virtue provided here by Yahweh is the formula to prevent domestic violence in Colossians 3:18-19, which says, \\\"Wives, be subject to your husbands, as fitting in the Lord.\\\" It would be rather more difficult to explain the virtues of the Bhagavadgita, especially to teenage boys from Laventille, since Bhagavan says: \\\"One who is not motivated by ego, whose intelligence is not entangled, though he kills men in this world, does not kill nor is he bound by his actions.\\\" Schoolboys may interpret this to mean that, since they aren't doing well in class, they could kill and not go to jail. The teacher should explain that this rule only allows Hindus to kill, and even then only if they're brahmins or ksatriyas. The virtue here is that this would lead to less stigmatisation of little black boys. On the other hand, teaching Religion could lead to more stigmatisation of little gay boys. Leviticus 20:13 says, \\\"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death\\\". But if this law was followed, would anyone be left to put on plays at Queen's Hall Would it have to be renamed Kings Hall However, teachers can take their cue from Seventh-Day Adventist pastor Clive Dottin, who says this is a moral law and not a ceremonial law, which I assume means that you needn't execute homosexuals nowadays but they're all still going to Hell. Where teachers will have the most problems, though, would be in reconciling religious facts with actual facts. In Mathematics class, students are told that pi is an infinite sequence of numbers of which the first six numbers are 3.14159: but, in 1Kings 7:23, the value of pi is calculated as 3. The fractions in the Quran also contradict what students are taught in Math, since Sura 4:11-12 and 4:176 state that when a man dies, leaving only his mother, his wife and two sisters, then they respectively receive , , and inheritance: which adds up to 15/12 of the man's property. Maybe in the first instance, teachers can say that everybody rounds up figures, including Yahweh, and in the second instance claim that this is proof that Allah performs even better miracles than Jesus feeding the multitudes with two fishes and five loaves. So, given that religion would still be taught as propaganda in T&T's schools, such a class would mainly impart ignorance and intolerance to the students. Which may explain why the Government is pushing the subject, since these are the two attributes that politicians depend on for votes. kbaldeosingh@hotmail.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Prof Cudjoe stated: \\u201cHinduism, a feudal religion of many strands, demands allegiance of its followers. That does not make its followers tribal, it makes them narrowly myopic.\\u201d If Hinduism is \\u201ca polytheistic religion\\u201d then one may draw the conclusion that the idea of the Divine is not exclusive but broad and inclusive. This is certainly not being \\u201cmyopic\\u201d like other religions which are exclusive, with the idea of God as one, with one scripture and one mediator between the one God and his followers. American David Frawley wrote in his book Hinduism The Eternal Tradition that \\u201cthere is one religion which has always formulated itself as a universal tradition. Hinduism does not rest itself upon any singular formation or belief system but has remained open to all approaches to truth through a great variety of spiritual teachings and practices apart from any organised dogma\\u201d. He continued: \\u201cThe beauty of Hinduism is that it is a religion which is open to the universal and not closed in an exclusive belief system. Hinduism is not centred on any single belief system. Hinduism not centred on any figure like Christ, Mohammed or Buddha. It has no standard creed or practice. It is an open tradition of spiritual searching that accepts all true human aspiration regardless of its name and form.\\u201d To write that, \\u201cHinduism demands allegiance of its followers\\u201d similar to the fanaticism of some exclusive religions is disparaging to Hinduism. This is not true. Hinduism in Trinidad reflects the pluralism of the ancient tradition, with many organisations and schools of thought. There is no Hindu political agenda in Trinidad. Over the years Hindus have supported both the PNM and parties opposed to the PNM. From 1956 the Arya Samajists, for example, have supported the PNM, together with other Hindu leaders. Even pundits have stood on PNM platforms. Jack Warner, in 2013, won the Chaguanas East bye-election with Hindu support. In 2015 the UNC recaptured the constituency with mainly Hindu/Indian support. In 1971 even Bhadase Sagan Maraj was rejected by the electorate. It is an error to suggest that Hindus support the UNC and formerly the ULF and DLP because of Hinduism. Just as faulty is the analysis that the ULF and UNC had their political base in the sugar belt and Rienzi Complex. A combination of factors can best explain Hindu political behaviour and not only religion. IN yet another incident which has had the effect of piling \\u00adembarrassment upon embarrassment for the authorities, a convict walked out of the Golden Grove facility in Arouca on Thursday, and was on the run up to last night. THE West Indies has had a phenomenal number of exceptional cricketers in its history. The captains have been mostly \\u00admiddling. I restricted the playbooks to those of Frank Worrell, Richie Benaud and Mike Brearley simply because they were known as thinking men; able in both the technical and \\u201cman-management\\u201d aspects of the game. International Youth Day is approaching. It is time for the youth of this country to stand up and make their voices heard. It is time to become more \\u00adinvolved in the political process to put an end to the corruption and mismanagement taking place far too often and for too long. Recently, the press \\u00adreported that a mother was in tears after her victim impact statement was read out in court during the trial of the accused for her son\\u2019s murder. She cried out for answers as to the reason the accused, having robbed her son of his \\u00adcellphone, had killed him. While the horizon must seem unrelievedly grim to many citizens, once in a while a few specks of bright light appear to \\u00adrelieve the gloom. And so it was \\u00adrecently when it was announced that the country\\u2019s first drug treatment court was to be established within three months.

Nonetheless, people's religious beliefs are sacred, and perceived inflammatory remarks against their religion will ultimately be met with commensurate responses. As such, tolerance must not be taken for granted and differences must be managed with sensitivity. One expects religious leaders to be more diplomatic and politically correct in their utterances than ordinary citizens. After all, their remarks are seen as representative of their respective organisations. For example, it was all well and good for a priest to lead a political demonstration around the Red House.

If we are to move forward, we must appreciate that child marriage was an acceptable undertaking among certain cultures and religions. Now that society has evolved, child marriage is seen as old-fashioned and disadvantageous. That said, secretary general of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, Sat Maharaj, should also tone down his rhetoric. I cite his response to Archbishop Harris. After all, religion is rooted in high principles. Without mutual tolerance, respect, and forgiveness, religion will be relegated to nothing more than cheap politics.

Occasionally some are sensitive enough not to give their titles. But the title \\\"professor'' as used in the British tradition is essentially an academic ranking, usually in a particular discipline. In the past, again in the British tradition, a professor headed a department and was intellectual leader in a discipline. The fact that one is titled \\\"professor'' does not necessarily confer on one any special competence in other disciplines, although there have been spectacular exceptions, such as Prof Joseph Needham, a noted embryologist/biochemist and internationally acclaimed Chinese scholar. In most cases one professor may be highly qualified in a particular discipline but know no more than a KFC cashier about Sumerian archaeology, or for that matter the orchids of Trinidad and Tobago. Most understand their limitations. About 15 years ago one UWI science professor responded to some letter writer in one of the newspapers who argued that the Hindu religion was the oldest religion in the world and in essence that its age conferred on it something of special significance in knowledge of ultimate reality. His response was essentially that Hinduism was a lot of silly superstition and mythology while Christianity and Islam were real living religions, the implication being that Hinduism was dead. And my guess is that, that particular professor in the following days may have lectured to a class that may have included Hindusthey really are tolerant. At the time I was somewhat intrigued at his notion of living and dead religions and wondered about his knowledge, good Christian that he was, of the history of the living ones and their murderous ways, and of diversification of Christianity from the original over the past two millennia. Exactly what makes a religion \\\"living\\\" and another \\\"dead\\\" To some, all religions must be \\\"living\\\" in that they actually have some sort of corpus of beliefs, worship or practice folk religious rites. In the monotheistic ones there are several subdivisions and sects, and some even believe that theirs is the true religion. To others all religions may be dead, irrelevant and no more than conditioning based on folk myths, a sort of displacement activity reaction, to explain the unexplainableand thus gain power over others. A recent letter coming from another UWI professor with no demonstrated published record in evolutionary science dismisses evolution as \\\"baseless speculations\\\". Scientific theories are based on scientific knowledge. The bases of the fact of evolution by natural selection include geology, palaeontology, biogeography, embryology, comparative anatomy, morphology, physiology, biochemistry, genetics and other branches of science, and indeed animal and plant breeding by the human species. To argue that evolution is founded on baseless speculation is to argue that many branches of science simply do not exist. This is utter nonsense. I wonder therefore what the letter writer might make of a suggestion by, say, Kevin Baldeosingh who might equally well argue that all religion is merely an uncritical acceptance of folk mythology, or, by, say, BC as mere manifestations of genetic expression of relatively few genes that had some benefit in binding small communities at one time, but which as populations dispersed contributed to the excessive intraspecific competition and violence. It is in no way unusual that evolution comes under attack from religions. This dates back to Darwin's times, although, sound scientist that he was, he took no part in the discourse. The opposition came from a church, the Church of England into which he was born and conditioned and whose Holy Orders he once considered joining. Darwin of course became agnostic in his later years. But the attacks continue using the \\\"flat earthist\\\" approach. They simply cannot grasp a simple fact that organic evolution is not about the question of origin/s of life, but about the facts of the processes of formation of species from pre-existing species, or, that there are several hypotheses about the origin or origins of life, some originating from science and many from folk mythology. You can accept or reject the fact of evolution if you wish. Religious beliefs however remain centred about a few unprovable notions and continue to be divisive of humanity. Religion and religious zeal are undoubtedly a force in human society, in some respects beneficial to binding groups together with common beliefs, myths and mores. In other respects the force may be exploitative, tyrannical and often murderous. Yet religions are hardly consistent in their \\\"beliefs\\\". In Christianity, the main stem which once burnt \\\"heretics,\\\" now fully supports abolition of capital punishment and accepts the fact of evolution of species, while some fundamentalist morphs offer instant miracles, deny evolution, believe the planet is 6,000 years old, praise George Bush and damn Barack Obamaand want to hang the criminals.

Television talk-show host Fazeer Mohammed was very likely taken off the morning show because of the discomfort of the UNC part of the People's Partnership.

Ken Ali's explanation is especially unconvincing in light of the fact that he's interim CEO acting without the authority of a board. It appears that the Government needed an excuse to fire Mohammed which Minister Surujrattan Rambachan, a prominent Hindu, clumsily created by invoking religion, thus laying the groundwork for the allegation now being made by Muslim groups in T&T. We note, too, that in offering proof of religious bias, the Muslim spokesmen have argued that Catholicism and Hindus also disallow, as Mr Mohammed said, female leaders in their religion. This only proves the fact that all major religions are sexist. The only question is whether Mr Mohammed ever let his religious beliefs affect his professional conduct. Representatives from our association have appeared several times on the First Up programme, usually to discuss matters pertinent to religion, and found Mr Mohammed to be an impartial interviewer. Our association has always promoted the principle that people are entitled to their personal beliefs as long as these do not affect public policy or, in this case, professional standards.

Here, there has been marked improvement in the number of citizens who no longer vote exclusively on race, religion or social standing. We say no political party can ever again win an election without significant input from all races. But have we gone far enough not to turn back to our old ways The cultural experience is that all people who live in one house will vote the same. We do not have the family separation that is the norm in the First World where the young adults leave home at age 18 and form their own political beliefs. Why are we not ready for true political referenda Agreement on the issue of child marriage does not a miracle make in T&T. All races and religions love their girl children. It was easy to review traditionally held beliefs to align them with modern-day laws. But using referenda for deciding political issues is an entirely different matter. We are the sum total of our experiences. For those citizens who are accustomed to obeying their traditional icons regarding race and religion, the choice to disobey is not easily made. For many of us, university education is just a cosmetic experience. The doctor, dentist, lawyer, architect, scientist, engineer and business entrepreneur will still in the main, follow the beliefs of parents and grandparents. This is the T&T culture. Are we ready for the permanent far-reaching effects of true referenda on issues that will take us beyond a political agenda that stubbornly hears the siren call of race Tick the box: Yes, No, or Unsure.

I congratulate the Minister and the People's Partnership Government in taking a bold step for which they will no doubt receive criticism from many quarters. On the Internet edition of the Express at time of writing (Monday 4th) there have been already 168 comments on the news report of the Minister's announcement on the teaching of religions! There may be objections, from individuals many of whom may not be knowledgeable of the moral values that are at the heart of all religions and which are so sadly lacking in our society today. There has already been discussion of this subject by stakeholders. Under the initiative of the National Commission for UNESCO a one-day symposium was held in 2008 and two workshops in 2010 on the teaching of religions. The feature speaker at the last workshop was a very distinguished son of the soil Prof Anantanand Rambachan. He is Prof of Religion, Philosophy and Asian Studies at St Olaf College, Minnesota, USA. St Olaf is a college in the Lutheran (Christian) tradition. He has a great deal of experience at the international level in religious education. There will be opportunity for further discussion at the Ministry of Education's Consultation on Curriculum that is being held this week. I have written articles in the Express on this subject in 2002, 2004 and 2010. I quote below extracts from those articles: Trinidad and Tobago is a multicultural and multi-religious society. In order that there be harmony among our diverse peoples, it is necessary that we understand the philosophies and mores of each other, for ignorance breeds fear and mistrust. However, while we treat with some of the cultural differences in the curriculum in our schools, no fundamental instruction in each other's beliefs is given. Thus many of our young people do not appreciate the moral values held by our diverse faiths. The breakdown of the family structure; the emergence of more and more single-parent families; the pressure on both parents to be away from the home for long periods each day in an effort to ensure economic stability in the home, all mitigate against the instilling of ethical values in our children. While it is recognised that the home is the best place for such instruction, it is proposed here, indeed strongly advocated, that Religious Education (RE) (teaching of religions) be made a compulsory subject at primary and secondary schools in Trinidad and Tobago. Such a programme would also help to address our materialism and selfishness. At the moment religion is taught on a voluntary basis as individual faiths to members of the respective faith (religious instruction). At government schools one hour a week is allocated for this purpose and it is not proposed that the teaching of religions (comparative religion) would in any way interfere with that existing programme. In the United Kingdom, which has become a multicultural society, Religious Education is now enshrined by law as a compulsory element of the national curriculum up to the age of 16, along with a daily act of collective worship. However, this subject is taught as the History and Philosophy of Religion, Comparative Religion and Ethical values. In Trinidad and Tobago, by contrast, if religion is included in the timetable (as stated earlier) it is left to individual religious leaders to give children of their faith instructions in the particular beliefs and many children have a free period if a representative of their faith is not present. The Dearing report, which was the last major review of the national curriculum in the UK, states that a search for a deeper meaning in life is essential to education, as is an understanding of the religious perspectives and spiritual development. It is necessary to distinguish religious instruction in particular faiths (as is provided for in our schools at present) from Religious Education or Comparative Religion which is the teaching about all religions. In the UK both Religious Education and Civics (Citizenship) are compulsory subjects. How many of us (in Trinidad and Tobago) have good knowledge of each other's religious beliefs And it is this ignorance which breeds animosity and in most instances culture is related to religion, and civics includes how we organise society in a relationship which accepts religious and cultural differences (and these in many instances are also related to ethnic and racial differences). In order to introduce RE (teaching of religions) into schools in Trinidad and Tobago a syllabus would have to be developed and teachers would have to be trained. To do this a Unit of Religious Education should be established at the University of the West Indies in the School of Education and Scholarships awarded to do the B.Ed. or the postgraduate Diploma in Education with RE as the main focus. In a subsequent article I shall once again present comments on the value of Religious Education in the UK sent to me by a teacher of that subject. John Spence is Professor Emeritus, UWI.

At the same time, a high level of education is strongly correlated with less religiosity. There is no contradiction here. Religion has played a key role in history, politics, social mores and the arts. In Western civilisation, knowing the Bible as a book helps the individual's understanding of literary canons and some aspects of philosophy. In India, the Hindu religious texts give insight into that society's world view while in Arabic societies, the Qur'an and the Hadith explain many of the actions and attitudes now engaging the world's attention. At the same time, an individual who embraces the fundamental goals of education knowledge, curiosity, critical thought and opennessis unlikely to be religious in any fundamental or even conventional sense. This is because these goals are antithetical to religious belief, which depend on argument by authority, blindness to contradiction and, last but not least, embracing or ignoring narrow-mindedness (eg, towards homosexuals, different religious beliefs, women). In a plural society like Trinidad and Tobago's, education about religion may well be useful, whether it is taught as a separate subject or integrated into social science, civics, philosophy or history. But such usefulness depends on the motives behind the teaching. Education Minister Tim Gopeesingh, in one breath, claims the purpose of this new policy is not indoctrination, then, in the next, says the intent is to teach the \\\"values and virtues\\\" of different religions. What is this, if not indoctrination, albeit on a perhaps broader ground than now obtains It also appears the Education Ministry has launched this policy without adequate preparation. What religions are to be taught Will sects within each main religion be included Is Buddhism, which acknowledges no Creator, considered a religion What about Rastafarianism, in which smoking marijuana is a key ritual And if the intent is to teach value systems (as distinct from belief systems), would humanism be included, given this is the philosophy which underpins the most tolerant societies in the world, and isn't tolerance the ulti- mate goal as stated by the Education Minister T&T Humanist Association www.humanist.org.tt TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Am I the only one who has taken note of the fact that the school in question is a \\\"Hindu\\\" primary school I have no doubt that it is so called because it was established to teach and further Hindu values. In fact, Mr Maharaj himself, has suggested that his reason for not wanting non-Hindu students and staff at the school is because allowing non-Hindus at the school may result in the contravention of Hindu beliefs and practices. His concern is only natural, for if one sees one's religious beliefs as right, then naturally, one would not want anyone or anything to erode or dilute those beliefs. As a Christian, I understand the fears of Maharaj, for I too, if I headed a Christian primary school, would not want anyone or anything contravening Christian beliefs and I would seek to enforce Christian beliefs in the same way that Maharaj is merely seeking to enforce Hindu beliefs. Thus, there is no reason for the PNM MP Patricia McIntosh to make an issue of Maharaj's refusal to allow non-Hindu students at the school. With regard to the fact that the school is a public school, the fact remains that the Maha Sabha, by virtue of owning the buildings that house the school, has some say in how the school is run. And though the Government financially assists the school, it must respect Maharaj's right (and in doing so, the right of others) to freedom of religion.

I have heard this Government say that we are a multi-religious, multi-ethnic society, yet the Education Minister has mentioned only three religions which are to be taught in schools. Well so much for the multi-religious concept. The 'Christian' religion or faith, is subdivided into many distinct groupings which are in some cases totally different from each other; so your intention is to now lump Catholic, Anglican, Seventh-Day Adventist, Protestant, Southern Baptist (different from Trinidad Baptist), Presbyterian, Born-again and Orthodox into one heap. Sir, that sort of thinking shows a lack of consideration and gross ignorance of these religious groupings, on your part. We also have the Yorb religion which subdivides into three sects in this country: Orisa, Baptist and Shango. Trinidad also has a strong Moslem and Muslim representation. There even exists some subdivision of the Hindu religion, with the traditional Santana Dharma or Hinduism, the Hare Krishna sects and recently the Bramanite sects (which is a kind of mixture of both the Christian and Hindu beliefs); then what about Shinto the Japanese faith; or Buddhism and Taoism or even Shenism, which are all Chinese religions; or the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star; so much for all religions. To teach only three religions and leave out the rest is discriminatory and promotes division rather than inclusion, unity and harmony; so much for multi-ethnic inclusion. Sir, during my school days in the then Mount St Benedict College (an all-boys, Catholic school), we had religious studies which taught predominantly about the existence of a Supreme Being or God (whichever you prefer); and then we dealt with the existence of the many various religions and the ways in which different people worshiped Him in their different religions. I believe that method made all feel included as all religions were taught with equal merit and none were excluded. That was some 30 plus years ago. I dread to think that the education fraternity had a better understanding and more wisdom then, than now. Who comes up with these ideas anyhow Teaching of only three religions in exclusion; and teaching all is just foolishness. I believe the way in which I was taught is the better way to go, as it will remove disharmony and discontent and provide the much needed appreciation of God; which I am hoping was the original intent; unless I am totally misguided, and you had some hidden agenda.

The letter, written by a self-professed Christian, championed Sat Maharaj's right to enforce Hindu beliefs and practices in Hindu schools. The writer states: \\\"As a Christian, I understand the fears of Maharaj, for I too, if I headed a Christian primary school, would not want anyone or anything contravening Christian beliefs and I would seek to enforce Christian beliefs in the same way that Maharaj is merely seeking to enforce Hindu beliefs.'' I would like to state that Mr Maharaj is indeed correct to express and demand his right to freedom of religion. But what happens when we try to apply our religion to everything about living our lives Do we then shop at places that only our particular religion controls Do we only associate with people of our own religion What happens if another school of a particular religion discriminates against people of a different religion to avoid \\\"contravention'' of that school's religious rules Is this the answer to preserving one's beliefs and culture No individual should ever under any circumstances have his faith compromised, especially when his religion is practised in the school and all students are required to adhere to these rules and regulations. The Christian, Hindu and Muslim schools all practise their religious beliefs while students who are not of the particular religion attend the schools but adhere to the rules and regulations therein. The letter contained statements suggesting that Mr Maharaj was not being allowed freedom of religion but on the contrary it is those who are reportedly being discriminated against who are not being allowed that right. Trinidad and Tobago is a multi-ethnic society and thus we should live like one. Thinking along the lines of purely religion and race will only create hate and division of our beloved country.
