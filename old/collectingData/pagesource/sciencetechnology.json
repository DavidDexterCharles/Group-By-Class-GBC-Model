He also said the presence of about 350 pupils from 14 schools including Tobago was an indication curriculum areas including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will soon experience a transformation. He spoke last Wednesday at the Second Women and Girls in ICT Forum at the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA), Port of Spain. The pupils listened to motivational speakers and they visited a plethora of booths where they got informative literature and paraphernalia. Griffith said: \\\"We are already on the journey of change. You have bolstered my resolve to do even more, because I recognise what we do and what we are trying to advance is neither useless nor insignificant. But rather it can contribute to the foundational work required to develop a truly inclusive and modern society. We must be grateful for the opportunities afforded here to pursue education in diverse fields.\\\" Griffith added: \\\"Our intention is to encourage and use and apply technology in a manner that will stimulate critical thinking, problem-solving and the development of skills that will help you to absorb new knowledge all your life. I sincerely hope ICT will open your eyes and minds in various ways in which Science and Technology can impact upon your personal life, career, development of your communities and the future development of the country and the world. You are the generation of this Information Age since you are seemingly born with an intrinsic understanding of technology.\\\" Griffith also said while \\\"50 per cent of households own at least one personal computer while enjoying access to a plethora of radio and television stations, there was still much to be done\\\". But he said the nation must rise to the challenge by striving to secure a competitive edge in a world where daily technological advancements reduce today's innovations to tomorrow's antiques.

But president and chairman Kenneth Ramchand said in an interview last week that though times are challenging, these were exciting times for the university. Noting that Government has brought in auditors to investigate the financial operations of the university, Ramchand said it was against this background that UTT was re-focussing on its aims and goals and getting back on track. \\\"The challenge we face at the moment is to win back the confidence of the population and to excite them about what the UTT was intended to be and what we plan to make it become. The vision we have is of a unique institution,\\\" he said. Citing as examples Ryerson University of Technology, the British Columbia Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology, Ramchand noted that the original sciences and technology curricula of these institutions were expanded to include the humanities. \\\"You'd find that in an ideal institution like this, the scientists go to concerts, see paintings, go to movies, take part in general discussions about life and so on. \\\"And the artists are always trying to pick their brains about how certain technologies may assist in the teaching process, the writing process etc. It is a synergy, synergies taking place there now that nobody had planned for,\\\" he said. Ramchand said UTT's intent was to follow a similar path, having begun as a science and technology university focussing on engineering and providing training for niche areas in economic and science and technology fields. He also said two months ago, UTT underwent a mandatory accreditation assessment by the Accreditation Council of Trinidad and Tobago-appointed external team of foreign academics, led by Dr John Randall. \\\"At the height of the financial crisis as it were, when all kinds of allegations were being made about corruption, Dr Randall and his team visited all departments and made a thorough investigation,\\\" said Ramchand. He said the team reported no concerns about UTT's fulfillment of the criteria for institutional accreditation, and that students interviewed by the team said that they had selected the university because of \\\"its distinctive role in producing a more work-ready graduate who is better able to apply industry relevant knowledge and skill.\\\" \\\"Our professors are up to that standard. And our students also were found comparable to students in other accredited institutions.They were judging us as an academic institution, and we passed brilliantly,\\\" Ramchand said. Regarding the university's finances, Ramchand said that while the UTT was involving all staff - academic and non-academic - in the review of the overall strategic plan, the institution had also instituted some cost-cutting measures and was continuing to look at ways of reducing expenses in line with the Board's policy of cost restraint.

Squeals of delight could be heard ringing through the corridors of the Divali Nagar site in Chaguanas as excited children of all ages and from various schools across the country came to witness and take part in a science exhibition held by the National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST) and the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) of India. The exhibition which started on Tuesday May 22 will run till July 20. The show is open to the public free of charge, and patrons were treated to 7,000 years of India's history and incredible scientific discoveries and achievements. This event is part of NIHERST's programme of activities to foster a national culture of science and technology, supporting the development of a more diversified, knowledge-driven economy in Trinidad and Tobago. Starting at 9a.m., hundreds of children flocked the entryway of the exhibition. Eager little faces pressed up to various interactive displays as they sought to get a closer look. Rei Medford from Naparima College had some of his friends raising their eyebrows as his head appeared to be resting on a plate of fruit while his body was nowhere to be seen. A trick of the eye according to one of the attendants as Medford reappeared all in one piece. The exhibit called \\\"Head on a platter\\\" was one of the more popular displays for pupils. Another favourite was the Infinity Well. Scores of children looked inside a makeshift shallow well that appeared to the naked eye as a bottomless pit. According to information printed on the side of the exhibit, the cylindrical wall of the well is sandwiched between two parallel mirrors; a full mirror on the floor and a half mirror on top of the well giving the optical illusion. One pupils who appeared tickled by the display, jokingly said, \\\"Be careful you fall in, it's a long way down.\\\" Administrator of the NIHERST National Science Centre Karla Sookhram said, \\\"The exhibit is open to children as young as seven and also adults. This is the first time we are having an exhibition of this type in Trinidad. Science and mathematics are two subject areas that is usually challenging for many students, we hope that through this exhibition it will stimulate young minds to the world of Science and Technology and encourage them to pursue a career within this field.\\\" Echoing similar sentiments, Senior curator of the National Council of Science Museums of India, Nataraj Dasgupta, said, \\\"This exhibit showcases India in ancient time as well as in modern period along with that we have some interactive displays for kids to encourage them to pursue a career in science and technology.\\\" \\\"India has a rich heritage in science and technology and this has grown in the field of not only science but also mathematics, metallurgy, agriculture, medicine, architecture and art and textiles. As soon as you enter the exhibition there are two large structures, the Konark Wheel and an Iron Pillar. India has a long tradition of making iron and steel structures and the Iron Pillar is approximately 26 feet tall. It is one of the more interesting displays at the exhibition since the pillar never rusts,\\\" he said. \\\"We have a custom in India, if a person is able to put their hands behind their back around the pillar with their fingers of their left and right hand touching then their wishes will come true,\\\" he added. The exhibition, themed \\\"IndiaA Culture of Science\\\", will showcase approximately 150 exhibits, featuring some of India's finest craft technologies such as bidriware, silver filigree work, lost wax casting and marble inlay to name a few. It starts at 9 a.m. and runs to 7 p.m daily and 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Visitors can also experience live science demonstrations, public lectures and cultural performances.

Formed in the shadow of Russia's doping scandals, the Rocket Science Project is hoping to encourage whistleblowers and create an independent training camp with a strict no-drugs policy. The group says ignorance and greed have driven Russian athletes to use drugs for years as a shortcut to success, justifying it with the belief everyone else does it too. \\u201cIt's stupid to deny that we have big problems with doping in our country. As a consequence of that, sports technology, science and knowledge are probably 20 years behind the modern world level,\\u201d says Evgeny Pishchalov, the slightly built distance runner-turned-coach who leads the project. \\u201cIf our system doesn't restructure, we're at risk of ending up without any Olympic medals in the coming years. We've been left with no choice \\u2014 change or die.\\u201d Rocket Science has already launched a hotline for doping whistleblowers, and is working to set up the training camp. Members will have to pay a US$25,000 fine if they ever test positive. The group wants to stay independent of Russian institutions and sports officials accused of overseeing widespread doping. Sergei Litvinov, a top hammer thrower, says Rocket Science will accept limited cooperation but \\u201cas soon as we feel any kind of pressure, we'd rather shut it all down.\\u201d Russia's ban from international track and field in 2015 for widespread drug use sparked anger from Russian athletes who felt the sanction wasn't fair. As denials dominated social media debates among Russian athletes and coaches, a minority argued for reforms and a doping crackdown, and said Russia shouldn't be proud of drug cheats' medals. That sowed the seeds for the Rocket Science Project, though convincing more Russian athletes to follow their lead is hard. \\u201cWe've got the mentality that all the others (in other countries) are gulping down banned substance and we do it a little less, so we're the good ones,\\u201d says Vasily Permitin, a runner who's part of the project. \\u201cAnd if you believe everyone is taking it, reporting on them is seen as bad.\\u201d Jereem \\u201cthe Dream\\u201d Richards, in the Men\\u2019s 200m dash, and the Men\\u2019s 4x100m relay team both grabbed silver last evening, helping Team TTO to its biggest medal haul at a Pan American Games with two more days to go.

Chandrayaan-1, India's maiden lunar probe, has made an epochal research breakthrough by finding the strongest ever evidence of the presence of water on the moon. Chandrayaan-1, has in the eyes of the world, become a vibrant symbol of India's surging technological prowess and scientific acumen. As pointed out by G. Madhavan Nair, the then Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the message of Chandrayaan-1, which was hoisted into space in October 2008, is vocal and clear: as far as space is concerned, India is a developed country. Describing the detection of water on the moon as a historic event of great significance for the future of the deep space exploration programme, Nair observed \\\"So far no mission has confirmed the presence of water on the moon positively\\\". It was the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), one of the five international payloads onboard the Rs.3860-million Indian moon mission which revealed that far from being dry, the moon harbours water in the form of molecules. In a way, this path-breaking discovery, arguably the most exciting in space exploration, stands. out as a splendid example of collaboration between the scientists from ISRO and NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) of USA. The wealth of data made available by M3, built by Brown University and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for NASA, has shown that the chemistry of the moon is totally different from what was envisioned earlier. Fully integrated Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft (left) and loading it to Thermovac Chamber (right). \\\"Widespread water has been detected on the surface of the moon. You have to think outside of box on this. This was expected a decade ago,\\\" said Carle Pieters, the M3 principal investigator and a Planetary Geologist at Brown University. In the same vein, Jim Green, Director of Planetary Science Division of NASA headquarters in Washington DC observes, \\\"water ice on the moon has been something of a holy grail for lunar scientists for a very long time. This surprising finding has come about through the ingenuity, perseverance and international cooperation between ISRO and NASA.\\\" Clearly, this exciting discovery has gone to show that Chandrayaan-1 originally designed for a life span of two years despite having its mission terminated prematurely, has been a huge success since it has met all the objectives set for it. Nair drove home the point that the Indian moon orbiter has realized more than 95% of the scientific goals set for it. \\\"Finding presence of water or ice on the moon was one of the major scientific objectives of Chandrayaan-1,\\\" noted M. Annadurai, the Project Director of Chandrayaan-1. Scientific objectives apart, Chandrayaan-1 was also aimed at upgrading India's technological capability and providing challenging opportunities for bright, young scientists in the area of planetary research. \\\"From the launch pad and reaching its precise orbit around the moon and landing the MIP (Moon Impact Probe) on the lunar surface and gathering data, we have crossed all the milestones,\\\" says Nair. Moon Impact Probe integration with Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft undergoing pre-launch test. According to ISRO, the M3 payload has detected signs of water and hydroxyl on the surface soil and rocks at widely diverse zones of the sunlit regions of the moon. This has dispelled the long held view that the moon is bone dry and water on the moon is found only in craters in the shadowed polar regions. As pointed out by Nair, the presence of water on the moon could pave way for a host of activities including the setting up of observatories, human bases, launching deep space inter-planetary missions by using the moon as the base and also extracting fuel for rockets. Of course, mining of the lunar resources including Helium-3, a green and rich energy source, could be another beneficial fall out of the discovery of water on the moon. In yet another landmark finding, the SARA (Sub Kev Atom Reflecting Analyser) payload onboard Chandrayaan-1 has found that water on the moon is generated internally. SARA payload was contributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) by way of collaboration between Swedish Institute of Space Physics and Space Physics Laboratory of the Thiruvananthapuram based Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), the largest space establishment under ISRO. The SARA data has revealed that the moon acts like a big sponge by constantly absorbing electrically charged particles spewed by the sun. Hydrogen molecules in these particles interact with the oxygen present in dust particles found on the lunar surface to produce water. PSLV-C11 Lift off Chandrayaan-1 India's first Mission to Moon. Perhaps the crowning glory of the Indian lunar probe has been the discovery of water by the Indian built 29-kg MIP payload while crashing on the lunar surface on Nov. 14, 2008 coinciding with the birthday of the first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who had envisioned the need for India to stay ahead in science and technology. \\\"The MIP while falling on the moon picked up strong signals of water particles. It was varying from the moon's equator to the poles. These variations from equator to poles coincided with the findings from M3\\\" states Nair. Incidentally, MIP was meant to provide ISRO an insight into the technology of robotic space landing systems. Indian built 29-kg Moon Impact Probe (MIP) One big achievement of MIP was the planting of the Indian national flag on the lunar surface. For this payload which was included in the Chandrayaan-1 mission, at the behest of the former Indian President and well known space scientist Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, featured the painting of the Indian tricolour on all its sides. And with this signal achievement India became the fourth country in the world to put a robotic probe on the moon and plant its national flag. Moments after the flawless MIP crash-landing on the surface of the moon, a joyous Nair said, \\\"We had promised the country that we will deliver the moon and we have done it.\\\" Profiling the achievement of Chandrayaan-1 during 312 days of its mission life, ISRO says that it has completed around 3,400 orbits and made available more than 70,000 high quality images, some of which provide a breathtaking view of the lunar mountains and craters in the permanently shadowed regions of the moon. Incidentally, this challenging and complex mission to the moon, was taken up by ISRO with a view to strengthen India's position as a forward looking space power keen on exploring the deeper reaches of outer space with a greater vigour in the years ahead. The flawless launch of Chandrayaan-1 on October 22, 2008 by means of the four stage reliable Indian space workhorse PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) and its subsequent insertion into the lunar orbit has catapulted India into the elite group of countries USA, Russia, China, Japan and ESA which have launched probes to earth's nearest celestial neighbour. Indeed, for a developing nation that began its space journey in a modest way back in 1963 with the test firing of a 9-kg. sounding rocket from the fishing hamlet of Thumba on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram, Chandrayaan-1 marks a giant leap ahead. Moreover, Chandrayaan-1 is known to have cost only a fraction of the investment on similar probes launched by other space faring nations including China and Japan. \\\"With a miniscule budget, we have mastered cutting edge space technology\\\" quipped Nair. The discovery of water on the moon by Chandrayaan-I has opened up the exciting possibility of reorienting the mission goals of the follow on lunar probe Chandrayaan-II slated for launch during 2012-2013 by means of the three stage Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). In this context Dr. Kalam has suggested ISRO go deeper into the lunar crust for water by employing the robotic penetrator. \\\"This discovery of water is all the more important because this comes after five decades of space research efforts by many nations. I suggest ISRO and NASA work on Chandrayaan-II to help explore the depths at which water is available by drilling holes on the lunar surface, using a moon surface robotic penetrator.\\\" Chandrayaan-II will be a Indo-Russian project. While ISRO will be responsible for the main orbiter, Russia will develop the main robotic rover with a landing system. Along with the originally planned 50-kg Russian rover, Chandayaan-II will now be reconfigured to include a 15-kg Indian built rover. Both these rovers which will make a soft landing on a lunar site to be identified using data from Chandrayaan-I will collect soil and rock samples and subject them to chemical analysis to look for further evidence for water and Helium-3. \\\"We are making a mid course correction for Chandrayaan-II. We will mine the moon's surface much deeper to fi nd more water,\\\" remarks Nair. Beyond Chandrayaan-II, ISRO is looking at the possibility of going in for a sample return mission to the moon. For this mission, ISRO would need a heavy lift off rocket. The semi cryogenic rocket propulsion system being developed by ISRO could help meet the thrust required for the sample return mission. ISRO has also hinted at the possibility of mining the lunar resources. \\\"If we find minerals on the moon, the next logical step would be to collect them and get them back to earth\\\" says Nair.

The breakdown of the number of open scholarships was listed as technological studies and visual and performing arts with two each; business, environmental studies, language arts and modern studies with three each; mathematics with nine and sciences with 29. While I congratulate the government for increasing the number of scholarships that will be awarded this year, why is it that science and math have the most scholarships whereas every other area has significantly less As a modern studies and language student, I find it insulting and unfair that the sciences, or as some like to call them, the \\\"harder subjects\\\", are given preference over the other fields. Yes, it might be argued that more people study the sciences, but 29 and three is much too large a gap. And if it is that the math and science students perform better in exams than students from other areas, shouldn't something be done to change this Maybe the Ministry of Education needs to provide more training for these teachers, or improve the methods by which these subjects are taught in schools. Or, maybe these other subjects are in fact the \\\"harder\\\" ones, contrary to popular belief. From my own personal experience, both within and outside of school, I have realised that the sciences are continuously placed on a pedestal while business or language students, for example, are forced to sit on the sidelines and face ridicule and scorn because they are \\\"dumb\\\", or their subjects are \\\"so much easier\\\". On reading this article, I was extremely disappointed to find that our own Ministry of Education is engaging in this behaviour as well, and is, in fact, contributing to the under-appreciation of any student who does not study the sciences. There must be some logic or explanation behind the allocation of scholarships, but maybe I am not \\\"smart enough\\\" to figure it out. Shouldn't every student, no matter what one studies, be given an equal opportunity at earning a scholarship This very uneven distribution of scholarships is both disheartening and upsetting to the students who do not study science or math. I challenge the ministry to fix this glaring problem by next year, and show appreciation for students of every field.

It also means new technologies being introduced into the classroom. As students head back to school, here is a look at the technologies that will support STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) learning this year. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2 Digital Art: Enter some art classes today and you may find a dearth of paints, brushes and charcoal. Today, art students can learn the same painting, drawing and sculpting techniques they previously would have learned using traditional supplies, only with digital tools instead. While the traditional mediums aren\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t completely going away any time soon, today\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s students can benefit from the versatility that cutting-edge tools supply, from the time a project idea is conceived through when the finished product is shared with the world. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2 Visual Science: Whether it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s an anatomical diagram of the human heart or a map of the Milky Way, every science teacher knows that a picture\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s worth a thousand words, particularly when it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a sharp, clear picture. Teachers and students are benefitting from top of the line projection technology in classrooms. The LampFree Projectors from Casio\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Core Series, for example, have the ability to project images and video wirelessly from smart phones, laptop computers and tablets, expanding teachers\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 ability to create engaging lesson plans. Additionally, the mercury-free Laser and LED hybrid light source is energy-efficient, reducing power consumption by up to 40 percent, a bonus lesson in environmental stewardship. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2 Accessible Computer Science: Certain innovations are helping students go beyond just consuming technology. Apps abound for independent learners, as well as educators, to use in their classrooms to help computer science students of all ages and abilities to hone their coding skills. From straight-forward instructional apps to those that gamify the learning process, young coders-in-training have a wealth of resources at their fingertips. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2 Intuitive Music: New technology is rocking the music education boat in an effort to make learning an instrument more intuitive. For example, Casio\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s LK-265 is outfitted with such tools as a Key Lighting System, Voice Fingering Guide and Step-up Lesson System, enabling beginners to learn built-in songs at their own pace. Additionally, an LCD display makes mastering music notation and correct hand positioning easy.

Photo courtesyof the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. Embassy is pleased to announce the selection of two outstanding students from Trinidad and Tobago Alyssa Mike and Lisa Thomas as delegates to the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia, USA. Selections were made in coordination with the National Institute for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST). The U.S. Embassy, in coordination with NIHERST, identified these two participants as among the most promising young scientific leaders in Trinidad. Both delegates showed strong academic achievement in science and potential for thoughtful scientific leadership. Alyssa Mike of St. Josephs Convent San Fernando presented strong credentials in Applied Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Caribbean Studies and Pure Mathematics. She hopes to pursue her studies in medicine and biomedical engineering. Lisa Thomas of Naparima Girls High School, San Fernando presented strong credentials in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Caribbean Studies. Lisa is very passionate about science, especially in the field of medical research and hopes to be instrumental in finding cures for HIV and Cancer. At the invitation of Governor Earl Ray Tomblin of West Virginia, Alyssa Mike and Lisa Thomas will participate as delegates in the 51st year of the National Youth Science Camp. The camp will be held near the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia. The National Youth Science Camp was established in 1963 as a part of West Virginias Centennial Celebration. The National Youth Science Camp is an annual summer forum where two delegates representing each state exchange ideas with leading scientists and other professionals from academic and corporate worlds. Scientists present lectures and hands-on research, covering some of the most provocative topics in science today topics such as fractal geometry, the human genome project, global climate change, the history of the universe, the fate of our rain forests, and robotics. Delegates to the Science Camp are challenged to explore new areas in biological and physical sciences, art, and music with resident staff members. The Science Camp would not only offer the delegates cutting edge information from leading scientists, but also allow them to build lasting friendships with other participants who shared their interests and talents.

Tatil employees attend the special cake cutting ceremony that was held in honour of Tatil\\u0092s 50th Anniversary. I am pretty sure that PNM leader Keith Rowley never told his fellow MPs they could vote according to their conscience, for why would he use words they don't understand He might as well have spoken Latin, which is the dead language that 99 per cent of the PNM's supporters don't know their motto is written in. Tell them that \\\"Magnum est PNM et prevalebit\\\" and they'll either ask you for ice cream, tell you champagne tickles their nose, or pull out a 357. and shoot you for cussing their mother. Last Saturday, the PNM General Council met to discuss the split on the Opposition bench which occurred in the Lower House on Friday when former PNM leader Patrick Manning moved a motion for his lawyers to argue for him before the Privileges Committee. According to the party's PR officer Faris Al-Rawi, \\\"We are holding on to the fact that it was a simple miscommunication.\\\" But that's what happens when politicians start using words like conscience, principle or floccinaucinihilipilification. The confusion in Parliament last Friday apparently started with Port of Spain North MP Patricia McIntosh, a former school principal who, Al-Rawi might be surprised to know, actually has qualifications in communication. As Manning was presenting his motion, McIntosh told Dr Rowley that, contrary to a decision taken in caucus, she wanted to support Manning. \\\"I liked his rationale and my conscience would not allow me to abstain or vote against the motion,\\\" McIntosh explained later, according to media reports. \\\"This is how I live my life, on principle and conscience.\\\" I suspect, though, that journalists misunderstood McIntosh's pronunciation. As the former head of St Francois Girls' College, McIntosh may have said that she lives her life as principal, not principle, which is why she views the PNM caucus as a group of unruly children who need to be taught how to read, write, and not have sex until they're married. And she probably said she lives her life, not on conscience, but unconscious. That would explain why she's totally unaware that Manning didn't present a shred of evidence to support his allegations that Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar had built her private home without proper approvals and using money from suspect sources. It also explains why McIntosh apparently forgot that, in an interview with the Trinidad Guardian in June last year, she said, \\\"It's now time for a new leader,\\\" and \\\"We have to support (Dr Rowley) in our effort to rebuild the PNM and to have proper representation.\\\" So don't expect McIntosh's conscience to instruct her to resign now that she has supported the old leader, didn't support Rowley, didn't give proper representation in Parliament, and helped undermine the PNM. The Oxford English Dictionary defines \\\"conscience\\\" as \\\"a person's moral sense of right and wrong\\\" and, since this is a woman who revealed that she ran as a candidate in the 2010 general election after God said she should, her conscience probably tells her whatever she wants to hear. Naturally then, since Manning always says He always obeys god, McIntosh would naturally obey Him and him (and, no, I didn't make a mistake in capitalising my pronouns). McIntosh even changed her story later, saying that when she broached her feelings with Rowley, he told her \\\"Do what you want\\\" which, having a degree in Modern Languages, she interpreted as permission to have a conscience vote. (She also has a Diploma in Mass Communication, yet never learned to recognise sarcasm.) With her certificate in Communication Technology, McIntosh then felt compelled to tell her fellow MPs that Rowley had said they could vote how they want. La Brea MP Fitzgerald Jeffrey happily swallowed this, but later said that his support \\\"goes only behind Dr Keith Rowley\\\" that preposition perhaps more Freudian than Jeffrey realised. Diego Martin Central MP Amery Browne also voted in favour of Manning's motion, saying he did so for \\\"principle and conscience\\\", hence proving my contention about PNM-ites getting confused by unfamiliar words. By Browne's definition, he must have viewed Calder Hart's salary as conscience money; and he must have remained quiet in good conscience when Manning's prophetess started constructing a $30 million church behind God's back; and he must have been a conscientious objector when he thumped his Parliament desk in October 2008 as Manning falsely alleged that $10 million had vanished on Rowley's watch as Housing Minister. But the two PNM-ites who most represented our politicians were Arouca/Maloney MP Alicia Hospedales and St Ann's MP Joanne Thomas. Hospedales actually seconded Manning's motion, then ducked out of the Chamber so she wouldn't have to vote on it, hence demonstrating the overriding political principle to say one thing and do another. Thomas told reporters that she didn't avoid the vote but had to go to the bathroom at just that moment: and that explanation is also typical of our nation's politicians, since it sounds like a load of crap. kbaldeosingh@hotmail.com TWO videos which show minors engaged in sexual acts with adults are now engaging the attenti\\u2026 The prisoner who escaped from the Maximum Security Prison on Thursday, has been found.

Speaking to reporters after a Rotary Club of Port of Spain luncheon on Tuesday, Minister of Trade Stephen Cadiz said, \\\"Tamana will continue, Tamana is a go. We have some work to do; however, the original concept is still there. A lot of work was done on putting the infrastructure in at Tamana.\\\" The Rotary Club meeting was held at Goodwill Industries at Fitzblackman Drive, Port of Spain. He said the focus of the special purpose company which oversees the Tamana Park, ETecK, is now on finding tenants for the science park. On the hustings, Cadiz's boss, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, said under a People's Partnership Government the focus for development would not be on mass industrialisation and mega-projects. After her first Cabinet meeting on June 1, she also told the media, many of the country's larger projects need to be reviewed before her Ministers could say which would be continued and which would be stopped. She assured the public not all mega-projects started under the former People's National Movement Government would be shut down. Tamana is one of the first mega-projects to get the thumbs up. The park will be the only science and information technology park in the West Indies and will also house the headquarters of the University of Trinidad and Tobago. In the days before the May 24 election, ETecK's communications manager Carol-Ann McKenzie, said that 60 per cent of the park would be done when ETecK has a soft launch in September. Cadiz did not speak to the likelihood of a September opening, saying only that there was still a lot of work to be done. Another Ministry of Trade multi-million-dollar project which Cadiz will continue is the development of a Single Electronic Window (SEW), the first phase of which is to be done by the end of 2010. Sources at the Ministry of Trade said the first phase of the information technology upgrade would cost $90 million to roll out. The SEW is an IT-based facilitation tool which will allow parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardised information and documents at a single entry point, in order to fulfil all import, export, and transit- related regulatory requirements online.

Photo Sarita Emmanuel The University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) has been selected by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to host the regional Maritime Technology Cooperation Centre (MTCC) for the Caribbean. The IMO also announced that under the Global MTCC Network (GMN) project, Shanghai Maritime University in China will host MTCC-Asia and a further three (3) MTCCs will be established in other target regions - Africa, Latin America and the Pacific. These MTCCs will form a global network which will work towards promoting ship energy-efficiency technologies and operations, and the reduction of harmful emissions from ships. This project, which is implemented by the IMO, is funded by the European Union (EU). In its role as the MTCC-Caribbean, UTT will: \\u2022 Provide a platform for partnerships aimed at reducing emissions and enhancing energy efficient methods in the Maritime domain at a global level and specifically in the Caribbean region \\u2022 Identify environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies available to the Caribbean region \\u2022 Enhance awareness and uptake of environmentally sound technologies and build expertise within the region \\u2022 Provide advisory and market development services for technology adopters and suppliers \\u2022 Monitor regional energy efficiency needs and align training programmes to meet these needs. Over a three year period, the five regional MTCCs will deliver mutually-agreed project milestones while contributing toward the IMO's continuing, efforts to ensure effective implementation and enforcement of the global energy-efficiency regulations for international shipping. UTT's selection comes on the heels of a competitive tendering process which is a testament to the quality of the maritime agenda undertaken by the University as well as its focus on capacity-building in this important sector. Through specific academic and professional programmes which are geared toward meeting the human resource demands of the maritime industry, UTT continues to develop both the seafaring and shore-based competencies necessary for driving this highly specialised area. The University's academic programmes have received international accreditation with the Institute of Marine Engineering Science and Technology (IMarEST) while its seafaring programmes are accredited by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) of the United Kingdom and the Maritime Services Division of the Ministry of Works and Transport. As host of the MTCC-Caribbean, UTT will continue to make an indelible impact on the local, regional and international maritime sectors. The University looks forward to the many contributions which can be enacted through this designation and will carry-on its efforts to build capacity in the international maritime industry. The MTCC team constitutes Mrs. Vivian Rambarath-Parasram (Project Director and Head), Captain Sukhjit Singh (Deputy Head and Technical Lead), Mr. Isikeli Waqa (Energy Efficiency Advisor), Mr. Stephan Nanan (Green House Gas Advisor) and Mrs. Sarita Mahabir-Lee (Communications and Visibility Lead).

And I am pleased to say that it seems that this dream will finally come true. In March of this year, Cabinet approved a 52-acre plot of land in Couva for the construction of a new national science centre. This centre is envisaged as a complex of facilities (viz. a science city) and will be built in phases. The building itself will be constructed as a giant exhibit and will serve as an exemplar of environmentally sustainable practice in building design. The facilities will include, in addition to the permanent exhibit galleries, an innovation centre built for 14-24 year olds; a green outdoor space for relaxation and educational entertainment with experiments, an amphitheatre, etc. for use by the public; open-ended, safe 'learn-through-play' science experiences and programmes geared to young children from toddlers to eight-year-olds; an Ideas Gallery dedicated to blurring the boundaries between science and the arts and exploring the roles and relevance of new technologies, and scientific laboratories. The Caribbean should have had a network of science centres by now, as was recommended in an IDB report almost 20 years ago by consultant, Prof Errol Miller. Twenty years ago, despite the fact that all around the world developing countries were recognising the important role of science centres, science popularisation here in Trinidad and Tobago was seen, at best, as the soft side of building scientific capability and, at worst, a luxury for only wealthy countries to invest in. NIHERST still managed to create the only science centre in this region. South Africa started off at the same time as we did with science popularisation and now has at least 25 science centres. The same goes for India. It established the NCSM in 1978 and that is today the largest network of science centres/museums under a single administrative umbrella in the world, with 27 facilities across the country and more on the horizon. And now, not coincidentally I think, these are two of the emerging BRICS countries. The establishment of science centresvital education avenues in themselveswas reflective of a wider policy, which was being adopted in those countries, of embracing and investing in science education and scientific research. They are reaping the fruits of those policies today. In terms of science education, how do you feel the secondary school curriculum can be refined Refinement of the curriculum in science education at the secondary level cannot be taken to mean tinkering primarily with subject matter/content, as important as this is, but it must also occur at the system level. Meaningful curriculum refinement in science, and in many other subject areas, must arise from the understanding that all students can benefit from relevant and appropriate science education experiences. But what is taught should not just be for the purpose of passing an examination. Nor should science subjects be options to drop halfway through secondary school if the student will not be pursuing them at higher levels. Science should be mandatory up to fifth form as are Mathematics, English and Spanish. Every student should be leaving secondary school with a basic solid understanding of science that would be of some value to them later in their lives. This will be a stronger base for shaping a more scientifically literate society to fuel growth and innovation. The secondary school curriculum is still largely a one-size-fits-all entity. What is clearly needed here is a science curriculum at the secondary level with explicit learning outcomes for all students, including the very able as well as those who are not likely to go to tertiary education. The learning outcomes can be made compatible with CXC requirements as well as providing clear achievement challenges for a range of learners who may not be either interested in or capable of achieving the learning outcomes at CXC level. An important aspect of this approach is the need for the secondary system to establish clearly what secondary school graduation in this country means. The unsatisfactory performance in science at the secondary level can be attributed to weak teaching as good and experienced science teachers are not to be found in large numbers throughout the school system. The importance of teacher education at UWI and in other tertiary institutions cannot be overstated. It is now widely understood that tertiary education accreditation and quality assurance are key reform elements in this area. A growing sense of professionalism in science education is an important prerequisite. I also believe that in science education, as in many other curricular areas, a major refinement would be to put the curriculum on a credit basis including minimum credit requirements in science education and mathematics, which all students are required to meet. Of course, a number of students will exceed these requirements but we are concerned here with the education system being better able to enable all students to achieve their full potential and, in the process, provide the right type of output required for business, industry and responsible citizenship in a global context. Additionally, students of all subjects but especially science should work on projects and in teams to better prepare them for the world of work generally and of scientific research or innovative activity especially. There is increasing understanding of these new imperatives as evidenced by the growing interest in the development of a seamless system of education and training from the preschool to the tertiary level, informed by a long-term perspective on the whole teaching/learning process, and characterised by fresh and innovative approaches to teaching, learning and curriculum development at all levels of the system. There is an urgent need for us to wean ourselves from rote learning in curriculum design and instruction. This reform cannot be confined to the secondary level and has to be complemented by reform throughout the system and, in particular, at the elementary and preschool levels. From the earliest ages, students need to learn to work in ways that will better prepare them for real life situations, especially as scientists. These are basic skills for future scientists: working on projects and in teams; exploring solutions to problems in the community; the application of abstract concepts; as well as design and engineering principles. It is clear to most educators globally that in science education there is a need to move beyond the traditional approach. I believe that considerably more resources need to be devoted to fine-tuning the science curriculum, conceptualised and operationalised in seamless system terms.

CYSF \\u2013 which targets lower six science students \\u2013 is the longest standing non-formal science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics educational programme for nurturing the next generation of scientists and engineers in the region. The forum is geared towards inspiring and mentoring young people towards advanced studies and careers in science, technology and innovation. Students are exposed to a myriad of areas such as software engineering, biofuel production, genetics and biotechnology, electrophysiology, sport science and forensic pathology. This year's instalment promises to be bigger and better with informative hands-on workshops, field trips and projects, as well as one-on-one discussions with distinguished keynote speaker, Dr Colin Carew. Director and founder of a new innovation and inclusion initiative at the MIT Media Lab, Dr Carew will focus his presentations on the Caribbean as a world class epicentre of technology and innovation, and will also give an overview of emerging technologies and how the Caribbean can employ them to provide leadership in areas such as water and food security, ocean science and plant medicine. Camille Campbell, TSTT's acting chief marketing officer, said as a technology-based company and the only national full-service communications solutions provider, TSTT recognised the significance of supporting the forum. \\u201cThis is of particular importance to TSTT and we are more than happy to lend our support to this venture. In this fast-paced technological world, it is important now, more than ever before, to create an environment to foster creativity and innovation and to inculcate a sense of entrepreneurship among our youth since they are the region's future leaders. We are certain that the forum will achieve all of these objectives and sensitise students to the benefits of pursuing a career in this ever-expanding field of science and technology.\\u201d Marketing officer at Niherst, Keironne Banfield-Nathaniel, said in recent years, NIHERST has refocused components of the programme to give students an even more engaging and diversified learning experience. The week-long programme, she noted, offers an invaluable opportunity for students to increase their knowledge, broaden their horizons, and develop a strong sense of regional identity, as they engage with top professionals in diverse fields as well as their peers from other countries. She was also in high praise of blink | bmobile for supporting the initiative, especially in the midst of economic uncertainty. \\u201cCYSF is really a good experience for students because there's no real forum for youths interested in science. They get to stay in dorms to mimic university life and they also get to enjoy a week of fun but educational activities. This year, there's also a design challenge and students will learn about water purification, so it'll be really exciting. \\u201cWe are so grateful to blink | bmobile for their support and for understanding the importance of CYSF. Our budgets have been cut significantly but we are trying not to cut our service to citizens and our youth, so this sponsorship really helps to fill any gaps and not have to scale down what's really important.\\u201d CYSF has had several success stories, like 2012 participant, Jason Renwick who won an internship at the NASA Ames Research Center, California in 2014. After completing a successful internship, Renwick was invited to return to the research centre to continue his research which focused on electronics prognostics, capacitors, electrical energy and the prediction of failure in electronic devices. He then went on to win a 2015 Ames Honour Award from the research centre, and was also awarded the inaugural Rudranath Capildeo Young Scientist Award as the 2015 NASA Intern by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.

Facilitator Devaughn James demonstrated how an antique gramophone that was used to play music worked. The pupils then savoured a scientific feast at the booth highlighting 101 Inventions That Changed The World. The theme of Sci-Techkno Fest 2013 was Celebrating Human Ingenuity. Minister of Science and Technology Rupert Griffith delivered the feature address at the opening ceremony on October 1. Asked to give an overview of the festivals success, marketing officer Keironne Banfield said: It has been a success. About 50,000 children visited yesterday (Friday). The real success has been the impact on visitors and pupils. Over 95 per cent indicated the festival offered them new insight into science, technology, creativity and innovation. We had about 40 schools from Tobago. Asked about the flagship 101 Inventions, Banfield added: It featured the development of artefacts from the Stone Age right up to modern times. It featured inventions like the gramophone, nylon, electric guitar and, of course, the computer. It lived up to its reputation as a cutting-edge, immersive exhibition. It was a combination of art and science that was highlighted through a continually looping production. It was sponsored by Grande Promotions from Australia. Banfield said the science festival sought to promote greater public awareness and understanding of science and technology and greater confidence to make more informed choices. On Friday, schools including Blackmans Private School, Talparo RC School, Coffee Street Boys Anglican School, San Fernando, and Five Rivers Secondary School, Arouca visited booths like Inventors Den, which gave them an opportunity to experience activities like map-making, microscope-viewing, paper-making and activities on electricity. Students ranging from pre-schoolers to secondary school were welcomed by NIHERST facilitator Johanna Mohammed.

We are aggressively putting mechanisms in place to allow more of our students to experience the learning and application of science outside of the classroom and laboratory not only through internships but also through community engagement exercises,\\u201d said Dr Brian Cockburn, dean of the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST), at the recent launch of the first annual week of Science, Technology and Innovation hosted by FST at The University of the West Indies (The UWI), St Augustine campus. The launch, which took place on May 20, kicked off the FST\\u2019s week of activities under the theme \\u201cScience in Communities\\u201d and the sub-theme \\u2013 supporting partnerships in Science, Technology, and Innovation. The activities, which have already attracted several stakeholders, aim to showcase collaboration amongst The UWI, industry and communities, while complementing the faculty\\u2019s drive of supporting public-private partnerships, not only locally, but regionally and internationally. Dr Cockburn used the opportunity to emphasise the FST\\u2019s commitment to addressing issues which impact the lives of local communities, the management and development goals of governments and challenges faced by the private sector through teaching and research activities.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says computer science is the fastest growing profession within the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) field. They also project that, by 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Historically, access to computer science education and skills training has been absent in the curriculum for many underrepresented and underserved communities, despite research showing that exposure to these subjects at a young age makes students more likely to pursue computer science in college. The new childhood-to-career program, Amazon Future Engineer, is working to change that with a four-step process to ensure access for all students. K-8: First, the program has after-school computer science workshops, coding camps hosted at schools and various locations, and online computer science courses like Coding with Kids and Code.org\\u2019s Hour of Code: Dance Party \\u2014 all designed to encourage students to explore computer science. \\u201cWithout Amazon Future Engineer funding this coding camp, my son would not have had such a wonderful opportunity because I simply could not afford it,\\u201d explained Kelly Garcia, whose son Pierce attended a Coding with Kids camp in Seattle, Washington. High school: The majority of public elementary and high schools, particularly in low-income communities, do not offer computer science classes. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer provides 2,000 schools across the country (totaling about 100,000 students) with Intro to Computer Science and AP Computer Science classes through trusted curriculum providers. All students participating in this program also receive a free membership to AWS Educate, which provides them with free access to computing power in the AWS Cloud for their coding projects, and content to learn about cloud computing. Jennifer Tulipano, a teacher who is using the course in her classroom at Monsignor Scanlan High School in the Bronx says, \\\"It's exciting to see the significant increase in my students' creativity, logical thinking skills and confidence levels, since learning to code, and there is no doubt in my mind that we have paved the way for them to head down very successful career paths in the field of computer science. I truly believe our students, particularly our female students, have been empowered by the computer science courses.\\\" College: As students head off to college, the program offers new resources to support continued education in the field. The program provides 100 students from underrepresented and underserved communities committed to studying computer science in college with a $40,000 college scholarship \\u2014 $10,000 per year. For many students, this financial aid is the catalyst that allows them to pursue post-secondary education and a career in computer science. \\u201cThis scholarship is very important because it means when I go to college, I won\\u2019t have to constantly worry about money,\\u201d said scholarship recipient Leo Jean Baptiste, from Orange High School in Orange, New Jersey. Internship: Amazon Future Engineer also offers the 100 scholarship recipients a guaranteed, paid summer internship after their first year of college. Interns partner closely with a technical mentor and manager, as well as their fellow interns, to innovate and create. \\\"I not only witnessed but was immersed in what it's like to be a software development engineer,\\u201d explained Nari Johnson, a sophomore at Harvard University studying computer science. \\u201cI left my internship feeling more confident in my ability to transform a vision for a service or product into reality. As a woman in computer science, Amazon's commitment to diversity and early computer science education has been especially meaningful to me.\\\" Students, teachers, school administrators, and parents can learn more and apply at www.amazonfutureengineer.com.

This increase was announced by Minister of Science and Technology Dr Rupert Griffith during his feature address at the launch of the biennial contest yesterday at the Grande Riviere Room of the Courtyard by Marriott hotel in Port of Spain. Griffith urged young thinkers to get involved in the programme. He said: I urge young people to make full and unbridled use of this opportunity to develop the feel for the power to create and improve the lives of people around you. Be inquisitive and take part in this programme. I am happy to announce that the prize money for the 2015 Scientific Ingenuity Awards has increased from TT$1.25 million to TT$1.50 million. Aside from the monetary incentives, a number of local winners have represented this country internationally and gone on to patent and license their inventions. A shining example is Benaiah Simonwho was one of last years winners and is currently in negotiations with international manufacturing giant Black and Decker for the use of his invention. Dubbed the Genesis 1, Simons creation is a machine used for the accurate cutting of ceramic, porcelain, clay, marble, quarry, granite and composite tiles. Benaiah Simon Junior was present at the launch and explained exactly what their creation does, while sharing his familys story with the assembly. He said: Just to clarify: there are several machines on the market that can do what our machine does, but what we did is to incorporate all these machines into one. There was no single machine that could do all these different things. So if someone is building a house, they no longer have to rent or buy four or five machines, they can just use this one. Simon Junior also thanked the board and staff of the National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (Niherst) and the Ministry of Science and Technology for the opportunity and all their assistance in furthering the development of the invention. In closing, acting president of Niherst Joycelyn Lee Young appealed to the media to highlight the nations young inventors and those in the field of science and technology.

Cars already use many features self-driving cars need, such as cruise control, multi-view cameras, proximity sensors and brake assist and autonomous vehicle companies are paving the way to make autonomous vehicles (AVs) a reality sooner rather than later. However, one industry moving the needle with AVs is commercial transportation technology. Commercial fleets increasingly rely on new innovations to improve vehicle safety, monitor drivers, provide road condition alerts, map the roads, understand risk and track driver performance. The advanced technology being used in these vehicles today was designed to improve safety and efficiency while laying the groundwork to drive forward the development of cars of the future. The fact that commercial vehicles are driving hundreds of miles a day means the technologies are being tried and tested at a rate that will help guarantee consumer safety when AV\\u2019s hit the road. Here are some technological advances used by commercial fleets today that will impact driverless vehicles of the future: 3D HD Mapping Mapping today goes beyond getting from point A to point B. Companies are utilizing vision-based systems to capture everything from traffic conditions to weather hazards to even predicting ideal routes and drive times. Netradyne, a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology focusing on driver and fleet safety, is revolutionizing conventional mapping with dynamic 3D HD mapping technology. This combines computer vision, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), edge computing and crowd-sourcing to deliver contextually rich, highly accurate data and content in real time, all of which are crucial to design safer and smarter autonomous vehicles. Because Netradyne supports a vast breadth of commercial fleets across the country, its products capture high-quality HD video from vehicles over hundreds of thousands of miles daily. Their ability to collect this extensive information means drivers are equipped with robust insight regarding road conditions, including potential risks. Since these vehicles frequently travel the same routes, with constant communication between each vehicle's device and the cloud, the maps are able to capture data at all times during the day and year, something that will be essential to AVs learning to operate on these roads in all conditions. Vision-Based Technology Created by Netradyne, Driveri is a vision-based technology that provides fleet managers with a comprehensive view of drivers\\u2019 activity using intelligent cameras that provide HD video of multiple views on each vehicle. Driveri\\u2019s technology platform processes this visual data in real time to deliver insights and alerts to drivers and fleet managers. These in-cab alerts help drivers adjust immediately as potential risks occur. Prior to the launch of this specialized technology, legacy systems would only be able to capture small snippets of video when an event, such as hard braking, occurred. Unlike legacy video capture platforms, the Netradyne system records and captures every second of every driving day, allowing not only a vastly larger amount of data to be collected, but the ability to reward good behavior, as well as identify those who are being more risky. Using commercially deployed Driveri devices, nearly 100 million miles of data per month are captured and analyzed which can improve transportation data analytics for commercial applications. The data, and insights the machine learning used are able to draw, will be crucial to further development of AVs. AI A deep learning AIs system, such as that found in Driveri, works to identify and understand various \\u2014 often confusing \\u2014 data, including road signs, construction zones, railroad tracks and lane markings. A system that is always learning and getting smarter will be crucial for the creation of AVs. As AVs become a reality, AI will not only have to learn the nuances of the road, but they must be able to handle driving alongside pedestrians and human-driven vehicles, probably one of the greatest challenges for driverless cars since humans can be unpredictable. However, some behavior is more predictable than we might think. For example, drivers stuck in an especially slow lane may be prone to suddenly pulling out to pass stalled traffic. Autonomous vehicles will benefit from AI systems that can learn from hours of this type of observed data and predict those situations. It makes sense that commercial transportation fleets would be on the cutting edge of technology enhancing vehicle safety and efficiency. This technology is bound to have multiple applications, beyond helping drivers and the companies who employ them. The increasing development and combination of multiple technologies, relying on aspects of AI, 3-D mapping and more, will help create much safer, more reliable vehicles \\u2014 with or without human drivers.

In the first phase, six centres will be established in T&T, with an emphasis on training and access to ICT services. We will focus especially on those communities which lack basic ICT infrastructure, online access to Government services or even ready access to social services.\\\" Griffith said although the population of Trinidad and Tobago is estimated at 1.3 million, a report issued by TATT at the end of 2012 stated there are currently 1.8 million phone subscriptions.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Jul 31, CMC \\u2013The main opposition People\\u2019s National Party (PNP) has welcomed the resignation of Dr Andrew Wheatley as Science and Technology Minister even as it warned that the resignation would not put to an end the controversy surrounding the corruption and nepotism at the state oil-refinery, Petrojam, as well as deepening controversy surrounding National Energy Solutions (NESOL) and the Universal Service Fund (USF). In a statement, the PNP said that it welcomed the \\u201cthe long overdue removal of Dr Andrew Wheatley from the Cabinet of Jamaica\\u201d and that criminal investigations by the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency, the Financial Investigations Division, the auditor general and Integrity Commission into the activities at Petrojam, NESOL, must be pursued to their final conclusions. The party, which last weekend called for the sacking of the chairman of the Spectrum Management Authority, Trevor Forrest, said in its statement it wanted the \\u201cchips (to) fall where they may\\u201d. The PNP said that Forrest had made a\\u201d vulgar attempt\\u201d to improperly influence the Authority to hire former head of NESOL, Carolyn Warren who resigned from NESOL last week, after it was revealed that she had an undisclosed drug conviction dating back 25 years The opposition party said that the prime minister has a duty to ensure that these agencies receive the necessary resources to complete their investigations and provide their reports in a timely manner to the people of Jamaica. Prime Minister Andrew Holness has not yet named a replacement for Wheatley even as the Office of the Prime Minister confirmed his resignation. President of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ), Howard Mitchell, also expressed the view that Wheatley\\u2019s resignation was welcomed, albeit too late. \\u201cThis is not the end; it is the beginning, and it should be used as an example of a point of departure for the wider society for us to understand that we cannot build a nation, we cannot have the development that we so badly need, and the growth, without all of us living by the rules, not only the public sector,\\u201d Mitchell said.

The technology will be employed in todays Club World Cup curtain raiser between Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Auckland City as soccers governing body finally answers calls for it to join the 21st century. Hawk-eye, widely used in cricket and tennis, and GoalRef, which uses a microchip in the ball and low magnetic waves around the goal, will be used at venues in Toyota and Yokohama. The important thing is for the technologies to perform as well as possible and there are no mistakes, Hawk-Eyes managing director Steve Carter said yesterday. Obviously the worst scenario you can have is if the technology isnt that accurate (with) the TV broadcast cameras proving that the answers wrong. With European champions Chelsea, whose players have been at the centre of several goal-line controversies in recent years, competing in Japan, the science is set for even closer scrutiny. Hawk-Eye has seven cameras per goalmouth, said Carter. Youre talking millimetre level and thats absolutely essential for football. Carter referred to John Terrys goal-line clearance in Englands 1-0 win over Ukraine at Euro 2012 as an example of the precision required to get decisions right. If you look at the John Terry incident, we measured it using the TV footage, the ball was actually 25 millimetres over the line, he said. That is well within the accuracy of our systemtwo, three, four millimetres of accuracy in that scenario. Football needs that level. FIFA had resisted pressure for technology, successfully used in other sports including cricket, tennis, rugby and American Football, for years. But Lampards goal for England against Germany in South Africa, not seen by either the referee or linesman, prompted FIFA to finally turn to science. What happened at the World Cup in 2010 cannot happen again, FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke told reporters. The World Cup is the biggest sporting event in the world. The ball was not two centimetres in the goal it was clearly in. Millions of people see that and wonder how the referee didnt see it. Thats the decision we made after the 2010 World Cup. Hawk-Eye and GoalRef are front-runners for next years Confederations Cup in Brazil, although FIFA have kept the door open for other competing companies. It is expensive but over time technology gets cheaper, said Valcke, adding that FIFA had invested US$2 million to date on development and installation at stadiums in Japan. The more market competition there is the cheaper it will get. It has to be available for all but at the same time it has to be accurate. We cant afford mistakes. After analysing data taken from the Club World Cup, FIFA will choose which system to implement for the six Confederations Cup venues by the end of March. Those chosen will remain in place for the 2014 World Cup, although the six other venues could potentially end up with a different system. Obviously the Confederations Cup is going to be a competitive tender process, said Carter. Both the Hawk-Eye and GoalRef systems inform referees the ball has crossed the goal-line in a split second via a vibrating wrist-watch flashing the word GOAL. GoalRef were equally confident of persuading FIFA their radio-based system using low-frequency magnetic fields would be the most accurate. We wouldnt be doing this if we werent confident we were going to proceed further beyond this tournament, said programme manager Ingmar Bretz. Whichever system FIFA chooses, the likes of Chelsea, eliminated from the 2004-05 Champions League by Luis Garcias ghost goal, will have one less reason to blame the referee.

Speaking to reporters after a Rotary Club of Port of Spain luncheon on Tuesday, Minister of Trade Stephen Cadiz said, \\\"Tamana will continue, Tamana is a go. We have some work to do; however, the original concept is still there. A lot of work was done on putting the infrastructure in at Tamana.\\\" The Rotary Club meeting was held at Goodwill Industries at Fitzblackman Drive, Port of Spain. He said the focus of the special purpose company which oversees the Tamana Park, ETecK, is now on finding tenants for the science park. On the hustings, Cadiz's boss, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, said under a People's Partnership Government the focus for development would not be on mass industrialisation and mega-projects. After her first Cabinet meeting on June 1, she also told the media, many of the country's larger projects need to be reviewed before her Ministers could say which would be continued and which would be stopped. She assured the public not all mega-projects started under the former People's National Movement Government would be shut down. Tamana is one of the first mega-projects to get the thumbs up. The park will be the only science and information technology park in the West Indies and will also house the headquarters of the University of Trinidad and Tobago. In the days before the May 24 election, ETecK's communications manager Carol-Ann McKenzie, said that 60 per cent of the park would be done when ETecK has a soft launch in September. Cadiz did not speak to the likelihood of a September opening, saying only that there was still a lot of work to be done. Another Ministry of Trade multi-million-dollar project which Cadiz will continue is the development of a Single Electronic Window (SEW), the first phase of which is to be done by the end of 2010. Sources at the Ministry of Trade said the first phase of the information technology upgrade would cost $90 million to roll out. The SEW is an IT-based facilitation tool which will allow parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardised information and documents at a single entry point, in order to fulfil all import, export, and transit- related regulatory requirements online.

Hosted by the National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST), the biennial awards were held on Saturday evening at the Hyatt Regency in Port of Spain. Minister of Science and Technology Dr Rupert Griffith apologised for the absence of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who was said to be a victim of widespread flight cancellations due to a snow storm in the United States. The PM returned home yesterday. In his address, Griffith congratulated the 65 honourees and emphasised the importance of science and technology to the economy and T&Ts overall development as a nation. The minister pledged to expedite and champion upcoming developments such as the National Science Centre and the ICT-based Community Access Centres and also reiterated our responsibility as a nation to engage in the continual development and application of science and technology. He said: As the nation which invented the only new acoustic musical instrument of the twentieth century the steelpan, Trinidad and Tobago cannot be a country that is only engaged in transferring and applying technology. We must design, produce and sell our own technology. We must create our own solutions, as opposed to searching for answers beyond our countrys borders. The Prime Ministers Awards for Scientific Ingenuity is a competitive scheme that was introduced in 2000 to augment and highlight the intrinsic creativity of the people of Trinidad and Tobago. This year, over $1,000,000 in prizes were awarded in the categories of Scientific Innovation and Invention and Scientific Creative Solutions for juniors and seniors. In the senior category of the Scientific Innovation and Invention competition, designs for a sustainable hurricane and earthquake resistant house created by Richard Patrick Clarke tied for the first-place prize with a patented prototype for a mounted reciprocal trailing tracking guide for portable powered machine, as created by Maurice Peter Vidale. I am really very much overwhelmed by all of this, said Vidale, a humble gardener from Santa Cruz, whose innovation helps to reduce accidents and increase efficiency in wood cutting. I really didnt do anything much. It was really Buddie Miller who did everything in terms of the patenting and getting it in the competition, but I give all glory to God regardless because I would not have had Buddie on my side, or have even come up with the idea if it wasnt for God. The two first-place innovators will each receive a cash prize, in addition to the stylish awards which were collected at the event. In the senior category of the Scientific Creative Solutions competition, another male duo also shared the top spot: with Dominic Gordon and Ruel Elis working together to create the nations first Mobile OSH Inspection APP. Amongst the juniors, two ASJA Girls (Charlieville) High School pupils claimed victory, with Deemarie Gordon winning the Scientific Creative Solutions competition with her Safe Oil and Water Paint Remover and Esther Crystal Njonge winning the Scientific Innovation and Invention competition with an eco-powered light. The venue was adorned for this special night with display booths in the welcome foyer and to the back of the room, as well as large screens on either side of the stage to show video presentations of the entrants in all four categories. Musical interludes were provided by pannists, Dane and Denilson Gulston, violinist Anselm Walters and the singing and dancing team of Rana and Susan Mohip.

The Council held its annual business meeting in the new UWI Regional Headquarters building in Mona, Jamaica, and endorsed the recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Tuition Fees with respect to fees for 2013/2014 academic programmes. Students at Mona will pay an annual tuition fee of Ja$252,164 (TT$16,436) for the Faculties of Humanities and Education, Science and Technology, the Social Sciences, and for Advanced Nursing programmes. The Faculty of Medical Sciences will cost Ja$606,905 (TT$39,559); and the Faculty of Law, Ja$274,407 (TT$17,886).

The increase represents an 18 per cent recovery of economic costs and is below the inflation rate of 7.2 per cent recorded for calendar year 2012, the university said. The schedule of fees for undergraduate, pre-university and postgraduate programmes at the Open Campus will remain unchanged. Open Campus students pay fees in the local currency of the site of registration on a -course basis.

Manchouck discussed her ideas on science education with UWI Today. The following is an excerpt of that interview. You have been a strong advocate for popularising science education through a number of innovative programmes; if you had the resources what else would you do For the last 20 years, my big, unfulfilled dream for science popularisation has been to see the building of a world-class, purpose-built national science centre. This should be the physical backbone or platform for all the programmes we offer: a fitting house to invite our people into and make them feel more at home with science and technologyan environment that inspires and showcases the very best of science and scientistslocal, regional and international. And I am pleased to say that it seems that this dream will finally come true. In March of this year, Cabinet approved a 52-acre plot of land in Couva for the construction of a new national science centre. This centre is envisaged as a complex of facilities (viz. a science city) and will be built in phases. The building itself will be constructed as a giant exhibit and will serve as an exemplar of environmentally sustainable practice in building design. The facilities will include, in addition to the permanent exhibit galleries, an innovation centre built for 14-24 year olds; a green outdoor space for relaxation and educational entertainment with experiments, an amphitheatre, etc. for use by the public; open-ended, safe 'learn-through-play' science experiences and programmes geared to young children from toddlers to eight-year-olds; an Ideas Gallery dedicated to blurring the boundaries between science and the arts and exploring the roles and relevance of new technologies, and scientific laboratories. The Caribbean should have had a network of science centres by now, as was recommended in an IDB report almost 20 years ago by consultant, Prof Errol Miller. Twenty years ago, despite the fact that all around the world developing countries were recognising the important role of science centres, science popularisation here in Trinidad and Tobago was seen, at best, as the soft side of building scientific capability and, at worst, a luxury for only wealthy countries to invest in. NIHERST still managed to create the only science centre in this region. South Africa started off at the same time as we did with science popularisation and now has at least 25 science centres. The same goes for India. It established the NCSM in 1978 and that is today the largest network of science centres/museums under a single administrative umbrella in the world, with 27 facilities across the country and more on the horizon. And now, not coincidentally I think, these are two of the emerging BRICS countries. The establishment of science centresvital education avenues in themselveswas reflective of a wider policy, which was being adopted in those countries, of embracing and investing in science education and scientific research. They are reaping the fruits of those policies today. In terms of science education, how do you feel the secondary school curriculum can be refined Refinement of the curriculum in science education at the secondary level cannot be taken to mean tinkering primarily with subject matter/content, as important as this is, but it must also occur at the system level. Meaningful curriculum refinement in science, and in many other subject areas, must arise from the understanding that all students can benefit from relevant and appropriate science education experiences. But what is taught should not just be for the purpose of passing an examination. Nor should science subjects be options to drop halfway through secondary school if the student will not be pursuing them at higher levels. Science should be mandatory up to fifth form as are Mathematics, English and Spanish. Every student should be leaving secondary school with a basic solid understanding of science that would be of some value to them later in their lives. This will be a stronger base for shaping a more scientifically literate society to fuel growth and innovation. The secondary school curriculum is still largely a one-size-fits-all entity. What is clearly needed here is a science curriculum at the secondary level with explicit learning outcomes for all students, including the very able as well as those who are not likely to go to tertiary education. The learning outcomes can be made compatible with CXC requirements as well as providing clear achievement challenges for a range of learners who may not be either interested in or capable of achieving the learning outcomes at CXC level. An important aspect of this approach is the need for the secondary system to establish clearly what secondary school graduation in this country means. The unsatisfactory performance in science at the secondary level can be attributed to weak teaching as good and experienced science teachers are not to be found in large numbers throughout the school system. The importance of teacher education at UWI and in other tertiary institutions cannot be overstated. It is now widely understood that tertiary education accreditation and quality assurance are key reform elements in this area. A growing sense of professionalism in science education is an important prerequisite. I also believe that in science education, as in many other curricular areas, a major refinement would be to put the curriculum on a credit basis including minimum credit requirements in science education and mathematics, which all students are required to meet. Of course, a number of students will exceed these requirements but we are concerned here with the education system being better able to enable all students to achieve their full potential and, in the process, provide the right type of output required for business, industry and responsible citizenship in a global context. Additionally, students of all subjects but especially science should work on projects and in teams to better prepare them for the world of work generally and of scientific research or innovative activity especially. There is increasing understanding of these new imperatives as evidenced by the growing interest in the development of a seamless system of education and training from the preschool to the tertiary level, informed by a long-term perspective on the whole teaching/learning process, and characterised by fresh and innovative approaches to teaching, learning and curriculum development at all levels of the system. There is an urgent need for us to wean ourselves from rote learning in curriculum design and instruction. This reform cannot be confined to the secondary level and has to be complemented by reform throughout the system and, in particular, at the elementary and preschool levels. From the earliest ages, students need to learn to work in ways that will better prepare them for real life situations, especially as scientists. These are basic skills for future scientists: working on projects and in teams; exploring solutions to problems in the community; the application of abstract concepts; as well as design and engineering principles. It is clear to most educators globally that in science education there is a need to move beyond the traditional approach. I believe that considerably more resources need to be devoted to fine-tuning the science curriculum, conceptualised and operationalised in seamless system terms.

There are many other areas in which research is urgently needed. In 2004 a report on \\\"Strategic Intervention\\\" for the Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Marine Resources (MALMR) was prepared in collaboration with UWI. The Strategic Intervention report (at one time available on the ministry website) stated: \\\"There is limited opportunity for upward mobility of (research) staff. The terms and conditions of service, training needs, conditions of work, recognition, rewards and sanctions are not adequately addressed. The remuneration structure of the ministry is unable to attract researchers of high calibre. Research staff is often engaged in non-research/administrative/diagnostic (testing) activities. \\\"With respect to extension, a major concern is the limited transfer (of information) between the research and extension divisions. From the perspective of getting technology information, farmers hold extension officers in low esteem compared to agricultural specialists in the agribusiness enterprises. \\\"Extension officers are used for administrative services eg. financial, personnel, and compliance. Not enough time and focus are given for technology transfer. Extension officers are not equipped with up-to-date communication and diagnostic tools for field work in the support of the problems of farmers. \\\" There are limited opportunities for the upgrading of technological skills for extension officers. The rewards, recognition and promotion system does not recognise performance and officers appear to have no leadership and direction.\\\" The Strategic Intervention report further proposed that there should eventually be a National Agricultural Research and Extension Institute, independent of the ministry. The above indicates that up to 2004 opinion within the ministry was in support of separating the research and extension activities into an independent institution. Such a stand-alone institution does not have the advantages that can be derived from being part of a university as it does not include the staff and students of a teaching institution as described in my article in the Express of September 2 for the US Colleges of Agriculture which combine teaching, research and extension. This was recommended to the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) by a committee which I chaired in 2006. I shall describe the present status of implementation of the recommendations of that committee as far as one can understand the situation from publicly available sources. The first deviation from the recommendations of the committee is that the research and extension activities of the ministry responsible for agriculture have not yet been integrated into UTT and there seems to be reluctance on the part of the ministry to carry forward this process. It would be tragic if the resistance of a few were to delay progress in developing a strong support system for a vibrant agricultural sector. The second deviation from the original recommendations is the agricultural degree programmes being offered by UTT. Whereas the recommendation was for a single degree programme in Agricultural Technology particularly aimed at preparing farm-ready graduates who could become \\\"new\\\" farmers with tertiary level training, UTT is offering five degrees in the field of agriculture but specialised in separate programmes for crops or livestock. Three of these are to be \\\"science\\\" degrees: Bachelor of Science in (1) Crop Science and Technology, (2) Animal Science and Technology and (3) Biotechnology with options in plants or animals. The other two are \\\"technology\\\" degrees: Bachelor of Technology in (1) Animal Science and Technology and (2) Crop Science and Technology. Details are available on the UTT website. Note that there is no degree offering agriculture as the production of both crops and livestock as would be the case in many farms in this country. The committee emphasised that there should be no duplication with the UWI which offers a science-based degree in agriculture as opposed to a technology-based programme. A biotechnology degree programme should be at post-graduate level as in most universities since the subject is so broad that it is better to go into a specialised area of biotechnology after taking an undergraduate degree in genetics and biochemistry. The number of graduates in biotechnology required for the foreseeable future does not justify an undergraduate programme but rather a programme with a smaller number of graduates. Regrettably \\\"biotechnology\\\" is now a buzz word which impresses the lay persons making the decisions\\\"genetic engineering\\\"and all thatso it is likely to find support at the expense of producing farmers who are well trained as entrepreneurs to develop the agricultural industry! Another programme recommended by the committee and being offered by UTT is in food technology. However, this should be reconsidered since UWI also offers a programme in food technology. To mount six new degrees, in addition to a number of existing diploma programmes, will require a wide range of scientific staff. Further, if the integration of the research division of the ministry into UTT is being delayed or abandoned this will mean much duplication of staff between the ministry and UTT. I fear that the possibility of developing a vibrant agriculture sector will be greatly reduced if the concept of integrating teaching, research and extension is abandoned.
