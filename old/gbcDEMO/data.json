The AWFF 2016 TNT festival is being hosted by The Caribbean Travelling Film School and the UWI Film Program. The AWFF is dedicated to films from or about Africa and African diaspora or films from producers or directors from the same locales. Pretty much films from everywhere. The 28 films being screened have been selected from 24 different countries so there is a very wide selection in terms of origin as well as genre. Most people may think of documentaries as boring talking heads type of films, but nothing can be further from the truth. Modern documentaries run the gamut from serious drama to light comedy. They only have one thing in common. They are real stories about real people or events, but they are told in all the varying ways that modern narrative films have encompassed. Directors such as Michael Moore, who made many popular documentaries such as Bowling for Columbine, Sicko and of course Fahrenheit 9/11, have made the genre into a mainstream format, so much so that there are documentary categories at the Oscars, in recognition of the quality of these films. The AWFF is actually a travelling film festival and it is screened in the USA, the Caribbean, Africa and the UK, so it's quite fitting that it is being hosted by the Caribbean Travelling Film School. In addition, the curator of the festival, Dr. 'Niyi Coker Jr., is a lecturer at the film school and has taught the directing workshops both in Barbados and in Trinidad. Professor Coker is the E. Desmond Lee Distinguished Professor of Theatre and Media Studies at the University of Missouri, Saint Louis. He has directed over fifty major stage productions around the world. His narrative feature \u201cPennies for the Boatman\u201d, won Best Screenplay at the 2012 Madrid International Film Festival and was a finalist for Best Director and Best Film. His latest documentary film \u201cOta Benga: Human at the Zoo\u201d has already won the award for Best Scientific & Educational film as well as the Best Director of a Documentary award at the prestigious. London International Film Festival The Caribbean Travelling Film School is the English Caribbean's first and only institution dedicated entirely and only to teaching film fundamentals. It was established seven years ago by three Caribbean film makers as a way to train prospective crew members in the different islands, to help jump start the fledgling film industry in the Caribbean. Through workshop programs in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, the school has brought film making to the masses and trained dozens of potential film producers in the art and science of film production. The school's headquarters and studio are at 23 Gordon St, in Port of Spain in the middle of the district that houses the major learning institutions in Port of Spain. St Mary's College, Bishop Anstey's, St Joseph Convent, COSTATT and UTT NAPA are all within two blocks of the film school. This year's edition of the festival is being screened at both the film school's studio and at the much more spacious screening facility of the UWI Film Program. The festival starts on Wednesday 16th March and runs through Saturday 19th March with three screenings at 2 pm, 5 pm and 8 pm daily. The screenings are repeated at the UWI venue at the same times on the following days, starting on Thursday 17th March. All screenings are free and as they say, open to the public. The 8 pm screening on Wednesday 16th at the film school will be preceded by a cocktail launch and is by invitation only. The festival is sponsored by the lead sponsor HADCO and its brands Obikwa Wines of South Africa and Emborg and by the Cocoa Pod Chocolate Shop and Alternative and Biologic Solutions, distributor of Mosquito Dunks.",

He further stated that he at one time accompanied other officers to the small red-brick house in which Naipaul-Coolman was allegedly killed and found a pool table.However, forensic examinations carried out on those items did not provide anything of evidential value. Maers is one of the States final witnesses before it closes its case against the 12 men accused of murdering Naipaul-Coolman. There are just about four more witnesses to testify before it does so in the trial which has been ongoing since March 24 last year. The prosecution has called close to 70 witnesses so far.It is contending that the Chaguanas businesswoman was kept in the red-brick house for several days following her kidnapping from her Lange Park home, before she was shot once to the chest while sitting on a pool table after which her body was dismembered with an electric saw and disposed of at an unknown location.The trial is expected to resume tomorrow.",

        "CONTENT": "sc1hool1\nIt's that time of year again, and the shopping plazas over the past weekend told the story. I took notice as parents with children in hand and in tow, went from shop to shop buying school supplies. For me, the scenes were instructive.\n\nFirst, it demonstrates that education is still important to Jamaicans. As hard as life is for the majority of Jamaicans, I have noticed that most parents make every effort to send their children to school even those labelled as \"bad parents\".\n\nMy own organisation, Hear The Children's Cry, can attest to that fact. Weeks ago, parents began asking for assistance with their children's book lists. Some of the parents who called me simply wanted help with portions of the lists, pointing out that they could find the rest of the money. That type of interest and action is not indicative of bad parents.\n\nOur parents by and large understand how important it is for their children to have the required books for school, even when some of them, like my own mother, didn't know or understand the contents of the books. As a little girl, I was always intrigued and sometimes amused that my mother would shout, \"Betty, go tek up you book,\" without any knowledge of what was written inside them. My mother, who was semi-literate, epitomised that status and station, as well as the aspirations of many parents in her generation they weren't educated, but they understood the value of education and they wanted their children to have a better life than they had.\n\nThat sentiment has not changed, despite the significant shifts in the socio-economic and cultural life of the country. The parents of today still want to see their children achieve a better life than theirs, and the buoyancy of the \"back to school\" activities is a testament to that fact.\n\nI'm told that one of the biggest sellers in the wholesale markets and on the streets is spray starch, and the school uniforms tell the tale. Monday morning \"back to school\" is a sight to behold new shoes, perfectly starched and pleated skirts and crisp khaki uniforms adorn the educational landscape new book bags laden with books, and children bustling and hustling to school, filled with the innate hope and optimism characteristic of childhood.\n\nMany of the parents I have worked with, as well as my mother, would tell me constantly that they wished they had had certain educational opportunities as children. My mother was the eldest of 12 children and because of her mother's untimely death was forced to drop out of school to care for her siblings. As my mother grew older she would reflect on her childhood deficits, and though she became a self-taught adult, the opportunities she lost in primary and secondary education were difficult to recover. That is the story of many parents in Jamaica, and the baseline for parenting intervention strategies.\n\nWhat Jamaican families need is an enabling environment in which their children and themselves can gain economic independence and the self-esteem and self-respect that comes with it. Employment is a key factor. Parents who are employed feel better about themselves and by extension their children. Employed parents are better able to \"employ\" good parenting practices. My own motto is: \"Employ Parents Empower Families\".\n\nBut while the entire national focus over the next few weeks will be centred on the back-to-school environment, attention must also be placed on the thousands of young people who are not going back to school. Chief among them are those who left high school without any type of certification.\n\nOver the last few weeks there has been a widespread hue and cry about this year's poor CSEC results, especially in English language, and clearly the situation is cause for concern.\n\nBut as poor as the CSEC results were, it is not the worst story. Even more alarming is the large number of children, perhaps as many as 20,000, who were not able to sit the CSEC exams because they did not meet the required standard. It is that cohort, by and large, which helps sustain the inter-generational cycle of poverty and dependency.\n\nAdd to those numbers the large percentage of high school and tertiary graduates who, even with certification and higher educational qualifications, are unable to find employment or opportunities, or both, for furthering their education. We live in a society in which financial institutions provide loans for virtually all the material things available even, dispensing loans, I'm told, to cover season tickets for certain social events, but provide little or nothing for people wanting to educate themselves.",

Or some athletic young men, putting aside their preoccupation with babes, bling and gang warfare (not necessarily in that order) and channelling all that pent-up energy and anger on the makeshift basketball court.\n\nWhatever it is, these anonymous occasions of loosely organised athletic activity seem to be much closer to the fundamental essence of sport than some of the global mega-events that preoccupy the attention of hundreds of millions of fans around the planet whose list of priorities is topped by the need to ensure that the cable TV bill is paid promptly and that a fraction of the monthly budget is set aside for the must-see pay-per-view events that crop up every now and then.\n\nMore and more, we're seeing that the competition is not in the event itself, but the duel of television executives and broadcasting companies to reinvent, rebrand and aggressively market variations from the traditional fare, or at least present the old stuff as something different, just to ensure that the target audience, which has so many options to choose from, stays interested.\n\nYou look at a lot of international football and wonder what all the fuss is about. Mediocrity and boring predictability, even with enhanced crowd sound effects and an excitable commentator, is still mediocrity and boring predictability. Former national player Carlton Franco, back home for the launch of the Veteran Footballers Foundation two Sundays ago, wasn't as harsh as that but essentially said the same thing when comparing the systems and regimented structure of the modern game with the improvisation (critics will say disorganisation) and intuitive thinking that was demanded in the days when he played in front of the Grandstand.\n\nPete Sampras, still the holder of the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles at 14, was last week lamenting the growing one-dimensional nature of men's tennis with the vast majority of players on the professional circuit Roger Federer is the one notable exception preferring to stay on the baseline and exchange booming groundstrokes and passing shots with their opponents, thanks in no small measure to advanced technology that gives the modern exponent more power of shot than even the champions of previous eras ever managed off their racquet strings.\n\nIn the face of such repetitiveness, somebody with enough influence always comes up with a bright made-for-TV idea, like last year's three-match series between Federer and Sampras or the one-off event that pitted Federer against Rafael Nadal, with one side of the court being carpet and the other clay. And let us not forget that Sir Allen Stanford's \"20/20 for Twenty\" is just another manifestation of the attempt to cash in on the rising tide of popularity in this newest and shortest form of international cricket to the extent that it threatens the viability, if not the existence, of the traditional variety.\n\nSuch gimmickry and artificiality fly in the face of what a sporting contest should really be about, but as long as there are enough people prepared to pay enough money for such glorified non-events, they will continue to prosper.\n\nWhich is why Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao met in the ring in Las Vegas on Saturday night for a non-title event that was typical of the stage-managed sideshow that professional boxing has become.\n\nThis latest so-called \"Superfight\" ended after the eighth round with the 29-year-old Filipino, generally regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter today, dominating the American from start to premature finish. De la Hoya, stopped for only the second time in his 16-year professional career, hardly mustered a serious challenge and later conceded that he didn't have what it takes anymore, physically, to be competitive with the very best in the business.\n\nGet caught up with news from the news leader\nSubscribe now and get access to the Trinidad Express E-paper\nYet his lack of energy would be no surprise to those familiar with the challenges of a heavier fighter losing a considerable amount of weight to make the 147lb welterweight category, a division that de la Hoya hadn't fought at for seven years. Indeed, it was speculated that, in the time between the weigh-in the previous day and the opening bell on Saturday night, de la Hoya would have been back up almost to 160lbs, all of which would have taken a serious toll on his effectiveness when it really mattered in the ring.\n\nOn the other hand, Pacquiao had to move up two weight classes to compete as a welterweight, a task the medical experts say would not have been as challenging and physically taxing as the weight-loss that de la Hoya had to undergo to meet the requirements of the fight.\n\nSo why go through all of that for a manufactured contest in which there was no title at stake We all know what the answer is of course: money. Pacquiao earned US$11 million, his biggest purse ever. But hear this. Despite enduring the beating of his life, de la Hoya is expected to collect almost twice that amount by the time the revenue from the pay-per-view audience is assessed.\n\nNot even the old saying about the victor taking home the spoils holds true anymore in this upside-down, wheeling-and-dealing world of contemporary professional sport.\n\nAt least there's always the Savannah.",

Several dance troupes including the Marcia Charles Dance Company, Carol La Chapelle Dancers, Malick Folk Performers and Shiv Shakti Dancers have combined efforts for the production.\n\nMachel Montano who is these days working on his music in Los Angeles has taken time off to come in for the show as well as David Rudder who was scheduled to arrive from Canada yesterday.

Wray & Nephew Limited, a subsidiary of the Campari Group, a major player in the global branded beverage industry, said it had taken the decision because of the ongoing economic losses occasioned by the combined effect of escalating operational costs and the declining cost of sugar.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t in any way, shape, or form signal any exiting from sugar. We\u2019re simply dealing with this area, which is least productive, most costly, most challenging and difficult for us when we did a broad-scale analysis to make that change to cauterise the losses. That, simply, is it,\u201d the company\u2019s chairman Clement \u2018Jimmy\u2019 Lawrence told The Gleaner newspaper here.\nHe told the newspaper that the company remained committed to the sugar cane industry as evidenced by its recent multimillion-dollar upgrade of the Joy Spence Appleton Estate Rum Experience in St Elizabeth, southwest of here.\nAt least 226 workers have been placed on the breadline as a result of the decision and Lawrence told the Gleaner \u201cwe had a very good meeting with the staff and the union. It went very well.\n\u201cWe outlined all of the support we are giving to our employees, and I think it was very well received. We really went out there to make sure that we treat our people well because they have really done our bidding in terms of programmes, the activities, and changes that we made to try to improve on our efficiency and operations. It was the very least that we could do, and we are very pleased that it was well received.\u201d\n\u201cWe were forced into this situation simply because of the difficulties there,\u201d he said, adding that the Holland estate which was closed Wednesday, is below sea level.\n\u201cYou have to pump water off the land. It takes electricity to operate those huge Farbus pumps, and so you can see right at the outset, it\u2019s challenging. And even areas that we have to irrigate, you don\u2019t irrigate with the same level of cost as it is to pump water off the land. So that really is the fundamental story surrounding our actions,\u201d he added.\nLawrence said that the issue was compounded by the global situation with sugar, with Jamaica suffering a major setback with the loss of a guaranteed sugar quota to the European Union last October.\n\u201cThe production of sugar cane has declined, and global purchasers have been able to ",

Several companies dealing with environment protection supported the event, some using display booths like Carib Glassworks, Piranha International and Nigel Khan Bookstore.\n\nThis year, Allum has been involved with the mobile exhibition launched at the Savannah Terrace of the Hilton Trinidad and Conference Centre on Sunday October 3 themed \"The Environment is You\".\n\nThe aim of this year's event is to sustain the effort initiated last year where the target group was schoolchildren. The exhibition is a concerted effort by a group of concerned citizens determined to make the management of the environment a priority and includes top Carnival bandleader Brian McFarlane with additional support coming from bpTT, Piranha International and Green Cyclone Inc.\n\nThe theme encapsulates a continuing intent to sensitise not only children but every citizen to caring for the environment. While corporations and government play a critical role, everyone can contribute to 'keeping a clean scene' through little efforts that can make a large difference every day.\n\nGiving a few examples which cause environmental damage and their consequences, Allum listed the following: *The seemingly small action of throwing a cigarette butt through the window of a moving car can result in huge losses via a tragic fire. *Surface vegetation loss causes extensive erosion and during heavy rains assists voluminous unchecked flows of water into low lying areas creating havoc with life and property. *The reckless and irresponsible dumping of waste into our waterways has left many families without homes, children struggling to get to school and crops totally decimated and where no insurance coverage for this type of risk is available.\n\nSo not only lives, but livelihoods are affected in so many ways. Most importantly many of our hard working citizens are stripped of their dignity as the most affected must seek assistance from friends, strangers and the State.\n\nThis year's project seeks to inform, educate and sensitise the wider public to small conscious actions that can have a strong and sustainable impact on securing the health of our environment, for our present and future generations.\nWhile last year the group focused primarily on youth, this year the efforts embrace the wider public, encouraging small changes in behaviour that could impact the environment in very significant ways.\n\nThe travelling exhibition comprises graphic photos which juxtapose irresponsible behaviour with the images of the pristine beauty. Such beauty we can achieve if only minds and destructive attitudes are altered.\n\nThe concept of the travelling exhibition is the first of its kind, in that it will be moved from location to location taking its message throughout Trinidad and Tobago. The exhibit will be placed at Better Value at Gulf View Link Road, San Fernando this weekend.",

It is beyond the humanitarian issue and it is at the stage of putting ordinary people at risk who are in search of survival.\u201d\n\nSo said former foreign affairs minister Winston Dookeran on the tragedy at sea in which 25 people are feared drowned while trying to reach Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday night. Nine people were initially rescued and 25 remained unaccounted for on Thursday night.\n\nDookeran also commended \u00adnew\u00adly installed moderator of the Presby\u00adterian Church Rev Joy Abdul-\u00adMohan for considering opening the church\u2019s schools and places of worship to Venezuelan migrants and refugees. Abdul-Mohan has also said their sister churches in Canada and the US have opened their doors to \u00adrefugees.\n\nAsked to share his sentiments on the tragedy, Dookeran said: \u201cIt touches your conscience when people are in search of survival. Your heart goes out to the people who have lost their lives. The incident has to be seen in its historical context. There has always been migration of people in the world, and they have lost their lives fleeing untenable conditions. It happens in many parts of the world, and this is close to home so we are more \u00adaffected and impacted.\n\u201cSuch a situation is quite intolerable. It is heartbreaking. It adds to the urgent need to find some solutions. It should be resolved in stages. There should be a coming together on the issues of migration. Now I think Trinidad and Tobago might wish to take an initiative in stages to \u00adprevent things like that from happening again.\n\n\u201cIt also tells us about the need for urgency. It should be not just seen as news... as just a sea tragedy, but as heart-wrenching incidents that stir us into finding another solution and \u00adanother way of looking at things.\u201d\n\nDookeran also said: \u201cEast Indian immigration happened about 150 years ago, and in contemporary times, we should not see it as a \u00adnatural course. It will continue. There should be a step-by-step solution. It is about engaging all the parties, including the (Nicolas) Maduro regime and the Opposition (Juan Guaido). The United Nations Secretary General (Antonio Guterres) has a moral legitimacy to initiate diplomatic action on matters of such tragic loss of lives whether it in this area or any other area. It is a life and death issue. It is no longer a human rights issue.\u201d",

Bartholomew was speaking at a press conference held Monday at the MRF's offices at Queen's Park East, Port of Spain. He said it was a disgrace that the Foundation could not even afford to attend and present research papers at annual international HIV conferences abroad, because of a lack of funding. MRF financial resource manager Natasha Singh revealed that the Foundation currently owes in excess of $117,000 in rent and more than half a million dollars to various creditors. Bartholomew said for the past several years, the MRF has submitted yearly audited financial reports to the Ministry of Health, justifying the need for certain sums of money, without success. To add insult to injury, he said, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Colin Furlonge requested in a letter dated March 18 to the HIV/AIDS Co-ordinating Unit that the MRF and all other treatment centres provide a detailed report for the last ten years of HIV services provided including the number of new and repeat patients on a monthly basis. Bartholomew said this would be an exhausting procedure as the MRF is being asked to submit invoices for every single thing, including tissue paper. He said this move would further delay the disbursement of funds. Bartholomew said the lack of funds was affecting the delivery of services to patients as well as research efforts. Other issues raised by MRF staff was a shortage of essential HIV/AIDS drugs and CD4 kits as well as equipment that was more than a decade old. As a result of the shortage, patients have been switched to other drugs said Ingrid Marcelline, MRF chief pharmacist. And while patients would normally receive a three-month supply of medication, now they can only get a two-week supply, she said. Marcelline said the medication must be taken every day or the patient runs the risk of becoming resistant to the treatment. The shortage, she said, was putting lives at risk. When contacted by the Express, Health Minister Dr Fuad Khan assured that funding would be provided soon. ?Cabinet has passed a note, it is just a matter for the Ministry of Finance to organise it, he said.",

There's research that once you decriminalise it then the crime situations are lessened, there is research in that direction that when it is no longer on the black-market like everything else you can work into the parlour, the shop and buy and therefore the hiding and the stealing and the guns...that research says once you decriminalise it will assist in the fight against crime,\" Persad-Bissessar said.\n\"Some say because it is not such a powerful narcotic as some others are they feel that that can be decriminalised and controlled and it may help in the fight against crime,\" she said.\n\nPersad-Bissessar said she has no personal view either way.\n\n\"I have not made any view on that, we must have further discussion before that is done and of course when we have that before us we take that to Trinidad and Tobago for public discussions and consultations,\" she said.\nPersad-Bissessar, the outgoing chairman of Caricom, yesterday formally passed the chairmanship to St Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves.\nIn his feature address, Gonsalves raised the issue of the decriminalising of marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n\"We must have discussion on the regional policy regarding medical marijuana and the alteration of existing laws on the strict prescription of marijuana use for social and religious purposes,\" he said.",

CSEC students will not have to rewrite last month\u2019s Mathematics examination. That\u2019s word from the Barbados-based Caribbean Examination Council (CXC), following an investigation into a cheating incident in Trinidad. The Ministry of Education fired three invigilators and several exam supervisors, after a video emerged of students of the Tranquility Government Secondary school using their cellphones and copying from each other during the May 15 CSEC Math exam. The fiasco resulted in thousands of students from across the region signing a petition calling for a resit of the exam. However, in a statement yesterday, CXC\u2019s Registrar made it clear that this will not happen. It said after receiving written reports, examining other material and following due diligence, it appeared that there was no breach of examination papers before or during the time of the exams. \u201cHowever, it is clear that there was lapse supervision in some examination centres. That has been addressed,\u201d CXC assured. \u201cAny irregularities in any centre will be addressed as is done after every examination.

        "CONTENT": "Dr Winford James {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. Dr Winford James The Keith Rowley administration last Friday tabled a bill on local government reform without setting a date when the debate would start, and that has immediately caused UNC political leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar\u2019s hackles to rise. She is suspicious that the administration wants to postpone the local government elections which are due later this year. The bill is called The Miscellaneous Provisions (Local Government Reform) Bill and it seeks to extend the tenure of councillors by a fourth year. Ms Persad-Bissessar thinks it is \u201cnow a backdoor way\u201d to postpone the elections to 2021 when the latter are due by November 29 this year but, in typical Trinbagonian style, she blustered, \u201c(W)henever they call it, it\u2019s licks like peas! (I)t\u2019s licks, licks, licks! Is blows, blows, blows!\u201d She argues \u2014 tongue in cheek, no doubt \u2014 that since the Prime Minister decides when to call a general election but that since incumbent, Dr Rowley, must do so by November 20, 2020, in keeping with the law, he might be planning to hold both local and general elections on the same date in order to \u201ccreate chaos\u201d. I find Ms Persad-Bissessar\u2019s statements consistent with her record of both condemning postponements of local government elections (by the PNM) and holding them when they were due on her watch as prime minister. But I also find her to be self-righteous in holding that the PNM wants to postpone the elections since they don\u2019t have enough time to take the recently tabled bill through Parliament and hold the elections by November 29 this year. Let\u2019s do a brief history of her consistency and self-righteousness \u2014 using the testimony of her own words in a post-Cabinet press conference in August 2013. First, the merest of backgrounds. The life of the municipalities had come to an end on July 26, 2013 and she had decided that her government would not postpone the local elections, which would be held on October 21 that same year, but would be preceded by a bill to reform the local government system. Which therefore gave her just under three months in which to table the bill, have it debated in the Parliament, and hold the elections \u2014 less time than the PNM have. Not unexpectedly, she was accused by the PNM of wanting to postpone the elections, which accusation turned out to be wrong. And now to what she said in the press conference. She opens her statement with the headline: \u201cPeople\u2019s Partnership government does not propose to postpone local government elections and also proposes to lay in Parliament a Bill to amend the Municipal Corporations Act, 1990.\u201d Then she goes on to divide the statement into the following headings: \u2022 Local Government Elections will be held on time \u2022 Postponement of the Local Government elections by the PNM \u2022 The Value of the Right to Vote \u2022 Manifesto promise \u2022 Patron of the Local Government Forum of the Commonwealth \u2022 The Admitted Need for Local Government Reform \u2022 Municipal Corporations Act over 20 years old \u2022 Proportional Representation \u2013 Principles of Fairness Group. Under the heading \u201cLocal Government Elections will be held on time\u201d, she declared: \u201cToday I confirm to you that although it remains open to the Government to pass legislation to postpone any elections, the local government elections shall not be postponed.\u201d She explained that, following a meeting of the National Executive Council of the UNC, she had told the nation that former UNC councillors had proposed that the local elections \u201cshould be postponed in order to facilitate the implementation of this Government\u2019s proposal for local government reform.\u201d So then it was a proposal by UNC people which she was rejecting; she had no intention of postponing the elections, and actually did not postpone them. Under \u201cPostponement of the Local Government Elections by the PNM\u201d, she noted that she was \u201con record as having condemned the former PNM regime \u2014(Manning\u2019s) \u2014for suppressing the voice of the people by postponing local government elections for over four years during the period 2006-2010.\u201d She also observed that during the period 1962-1968 and 1974-1977, the PNM had also postponed local elections on three occasions. Under \u201cThe Value of the Right to Vote\u201d, she suggested that \u201c[t]he postponement of any election which is constitutionally due must only be countenanced in the most exceptional and extreme circumstances\u2019 (such as war and famine).\u201d Under \u201cManifesto Promise\u201d, she averred that her \u201centire political career ha[d] been based on respect for the voice of the people\u201d and that she was \u201cnot about to change that now\u201d. The 2010 manifesto had declared their commitment to \u201ca genuine participatory democracy.\u201d Under \u201cPatron of the Local Government Forum of the Commonwealth\u201d, she declared that postponement of local government elections was \u201calien to the concept of people-centred development\u201d and that as a patron of the Forum she was \u201cat the forefront of the international movement for the reform and strengthening of local government to give greater power to the people.\u201d Under \u201cThe Admitted Need for Local Government\u201d, she listed attempts at local government from 1965 to 2006 to show the need for local government reform. Under \u201cMunicipal Corporations Act over 20 years old\u201d, she emphasised the need to revisit the 1990 Act to address the needs of the 21st century environment. And under \u201cProportional Representation \u2014 Principles of Fairness Group\u201d, she promoted proportional representation as a fair basis for framing reform. So from the facts of her statement, the matter is clear. Kamla Persad-Bissessar has been against postponement of local government elections, and her fear of a PNM postponement of this year\u2019s elections is not unreasonable given the PNM\u2019s record. NELSON Mandela said education is the most powerful weapon to change the world. From the start of this administration, I called for a \u201cspecial focus\u201d on underperforming schools, a major contributor to the dangerous social decay in this country. THERE are many issues other than the NAR\u2019s bungling of the aftermath of the 1990 attempted coup with which I would like to engage. THE Government should not place too much confidence in its own statistics regarding the number of Venezuelan refugees in this country. Registration is in progress regar\u00adding the admittance of migrants from Venezuela.

But T&T, having monetised the nuisance by-product to create an enviable industrial estate and the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in 1995, is challenged with the now, more-favoured commodity. DESPITE BPTT\u2019s recent announcement that the infill drilling programme has not secured enough gas to satisfy its obligations to Atlantic\u2019s Train 1 which could result in the mothballing of the plant at the end of 2019, its parent company, energy giant BP, says it remains excited about prospects in Trinidad and Tobago. After inking a new energy deal with Shell on Wednesday Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley yesterday held energy talks with a high-level team of BP executives at the company\u2019s headquarters in London, England. AFTER 20 years, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago is getting a bigger share of the lique\u2026 LOCAL automotive battery manufacturer Lange Trinidad Ltd (LTL) has made a $50 million investment into a fully automated, digital production facility. The company has penetrated 12 markets across Latin America and the Caribbean and was commended by Trade Minister Paula Gopee-Scoon yesterday.

        "CONTENT": "May 17, 2019. Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Samsung is among the few companies that are primed for a hyper-connected, intelligent future. Through SmartThings solutions, Samsung\u2019s vision is to provide an open and seamless IoT experience with fewer boundaries. To that end, Samsung will enhance its ecosystem by opening its SmartThings Cloud to global partners, providing developers with easy-to-use SDKs, and expanding the availability of SmartThings to more devices. While the phrase the Fourth Industrial Revolution has yet to fully catch on with the general public, if you have been paying attention to consumer electronics news you likely have come across the excitement being generated by up-and-coming technologies, like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI). Industry pundits say 5G and AI are quintessential to ushering in Industry 4.0, which will fundamentally alter how people live and work. The future of hyper-connectedness, automation, and artificial intelligence, however, is not something that is light years away. People are already living this vision. Just look beneath the hood of your smart device. Smartphones nowadays are equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU) - an advanced microprocessor, dedicated to on-device AI-related tasks. This has led to improvements in the performance of smartphones with increased CPU/ GPU speeds, enhanced data security and battery life, among other things. Smart TVs are getting smarter, too. For instance, take Samsung\u2019s Quantum Processor 8K, the industry\u2019s first AI-powered picture processing engine, which can upscale content to appear in 8K quality regardless of the original source or format. Of course, to fully tap into the potential of 5G and AI, you need more than cuttingedge hardware; advancements in software and network solutions are equally critical. Samsung can attest to the importance of versatility. Samsung is uniquely positioned, with its diverse product portfolio and business scale to bring to life a truly connected. A Day for Telecommunication World Telecommunication Day (WTD) has been celebrated annually on 17 May since 1969. The date marks the anniversary of the founding of ITU on 17 May 1865, when the first International Telegraph Convention was signed in Paris. With the growth in importance of information technology alongside telecommunications \u2013 especially the Internet \u2013 it was recognised that the topic also needed to be brought to public attention. The aim of this day is to focus on the importance of these technologies and the wide range of related social and economic issues. When you combine the half-a-billion devices that Samsung sells every year and its leadership in semiconductors, displays, TVs and home appliances, the 50-year-old electronics giant says it has a deeper understanding and insight over how consumers interact with its devices. Combining its multiple consumer touchpoints, it has an opportunity to truly enrich peoples\u2019 experiences and interactions with technology. May 17, 2019. Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.

        "CONTENT": "There is some\u00adthing spe\u00adcial about Ash\u00adton. I love all the chil\u00addren, but some\u00adtimes, there\u2019s a spe\u00adcial some\u00adthing that is un\u00adex\u00adplain\u00adable. His mom de\u00adscribes him as a \u2018light\u2019 and hon\u00adest\u00adly, I think that\u2019s the most ac\u00adcu\u00adrate word to de\u00adscribe him. I have had the plea\u00adsure of hear\u00ading him sing one of my favourite gospel songs \u2018Break Every Chain\u2019 and with such in\u00adten\u00adsi\u00adty, and I am cer\u00adtain his chains will be bro\u00adken. JBF talks had the plea\u00adsure of chat\u00adting with his mom, and her love for him shone as bright as the sun, the ul\u00adti\u00admate light. Em\u00adbrac\u00ading Moth\u00ader\u00adhood Moth\u00ader\u00adhood is not some\u00adthing I took light\u00adly. In the be\u00adgin\u00adning, I was very ex\u00adcit\u00aded to be a moth\u00ader; I al\u00adways want\u00aded a child. I wasn\u2019t very close with my moth\u00ader grow\u00ading up. It wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t talk but, we were al\u00adways far apart be\u00adcause I stayed by my oth\u00ader fam\u00adi\u00adly a lot. Even though we were not very close, I still learned some\u00adthing from my par\u00adents. I felt such a dis\u00adcon\u00adnect from my moth\u00ader grow\u00ading up and thus, I nev\u00ader want\u00aded my chil\u00addren to feel that way with me. I told my\u00adself that I would make sure that my chil\u00addren al\u00adways felt my pres\u00adence, even if I was not around: \u201cMom\u00admy is just a phone call away.\u201d Al\u00adthough Ash\u00adton would have tak\u00aden up a lot of my at\u00adten\u00adtion, I al\u00adways tried to make time for my oth\u00ader chil\u00addren. Ash\u00adton is every\u00adthing I dreamed of, he is a light in my life and we have a spe\u00adcial bond. There is not a day that I wake up, with\u00adout thank\u00ading God for my son. Even when I am go\u00ading through stress, he puts a smile on my face\u2014re\u00adgard\u00adless of how bad it may seem. We un\u00addoubt\u00aded\u00adly have a spe\u00adcial con\u00adnec\u00adtion. It was very chal\u00adleng\u00ading when he be\u00adcame sick, but I still couldn\u2019t be away from him. One night, his fa\u00adther stayed with him and I felt like I was miss\u00ading a piece of my\u00adself. We have such a strong bond that when we are apart, I can\u00adnot func\u00adtion, and he can\u00adnot func\u00adtion. Once, his teacher called me say\u00ading, \u201cAsh\u00adton said he can\u00adnot do work be\u00adcause his mom\u00admy is not here to do work with him and that he miss\u00ades you.\u201d And Then There Were Two His sis\u00adter, Kay\u00adla, got an ear in\u00adfec\u00adtion while Ash\u00adton was in the hos\u00adpi\u00adtal. Kay\u00adla had to go through six surg\u00aderies and many months in the hos\u00adpi\u00adtal, but still, they be\u00adlieve there was a 50 per cent chance she would be able to hear. Now, I have two of my chil\u00addren that need my con\u00adstant at\u00adten\u00adtion. It was hard for me be\u00adcause I was dev\u00adas\u00adtat\u00aded when Ash\u00adton got can\u00adcer and now, my daugh\u00adter was sick. There was not enough of mom\u00admy to go around then, I had to de\u00adcide who I spent more time with. Ash\u00adton\u2019s can\u00adcer was more se\u00adri\u00adous, so I stayed with him more. How\u00adev\u00ader, I al\u00adways re\u00admind\u00aded Kay\u00adla and my youngest, Ash\u00adlyn, that mom\u00admy is al\u00adways there for them and loves them. Kay\u00adla\u2019s ill\u00adness af\u00adfect\u00aded her fa\u00adther more than me be\u00adcause they have a bond like Ash\u00adton and me. Two years ago, there was a fire that oc\u00adcurred at our home; my fam\u00adi\u00adly lost every\u00adthing; my chil\u00addren had noth\u00ading but the clothes on their backs. We are still try\u00ading to fig\u00adure out if my daugh\u00adter\u2019s ear in\u00adfec\u00adtion is due to the fire. Re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship with my chil\u00addren I had to talk to my kids about Ash\u00adton be\u00ading sick and what that means; I ex\u00adplained to them that mom\u00admy will have to take care of their broth\u00ader. The kids would al\u00adways ask who I love more. Kay\u00adla feels a bit jeal\u00adous be\u00adcause she does not un\u00adder\u00adstand why Ash\u00adton gets more at\u00adten\u00adtion even though she is sick too. How\u00adev\u00ader, Ash\u00adlyn un\u00adder\u00adstands and is al\u00adways ex\u00adplain\u00ading to Kay\u00adla why mom\u00admy can\u00adnot be around. Even though I could not al\u00adways be there phys\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly, I would try to call them every day to main\u00adtain an emo\u00adtion\u00adal con\u00adnec\u00adtion. I sleep with the kids every night. Every\u00adone needs to be at\u00adtached to mom\u00admy in some way; Kay\u00adla is on my bel\u00adly, Ash\u00adton in my hand and Ash\u00adlyn on my chest. This is our time when I try to con\u00adnect with them. My chil\u00addren know that they have to go to church no mat\u00adter what\u2014an\u00adoth\u00ader time we get to be all to\u00adgeth\u00ader. When we go to our church, Cun\u00adjal Open Bible, we sing and praise the Lord to\u00adgeth\u00ader and it brings us clos\u00ader. Re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship with my hus\u00adband My re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship with my hus\u00adband changed when Ash\u00adton got sick. We be\u00adgan to ar\u00adgue a great deal but, we al\u00adways knew we had each oth\u00ader. My hus\u00adband is the bread\u00adwin\u00adner in our fam\u00adi\u00adly. Hav\u00ading to be away from work was hard for him, but we need\u00aded him at home too. I need\u00aded his sup\u00adport and our chil\u00addren need\u00aded him. It is al\u00adways a prob\u00adlem when he has to take time off. Sup\u00adport As a moth\u00ader of three, I don\u2019t get much time to my\u00adself. Like I said, I sleep with my kids so that means even in my sleep I\u2019m not alone. When I have a minute to my\u00adself I use it to pray for my chil\u00addren and my fam\u00adi\u00adly. Fam\u00adi\u00adly is very im\u00adpor\u00adtant to me and it hurts that we aren\u2019t that close. I get sup\u00adport from my in-laws and I\u2019m very thank\u00adful. When you\u2019re clos\u00ader to your fam\u00adi\u00adly, you feel like you have the abil\u00adi\u00adty to move for\u00adward in life with a great sup\u00adport sys\u00adtem at your side. I thank God for our church too. They are my sup\u00adport sys\u00adtem and like a sec\u00adond fam\u00adi\u00adly. Mem\u00adbers of the church are al\u00adways pray\u00ading for us and they call me al\u00admost every day to see if I\u2019m in need of any\u00adthing. Fu\u00adture for Ash\u00adton I be\u00adlieve that by the grace of God Ash\u00adton will get bet\u00adter and be able to grow up and have a life away from the hos\u00adpi\u00adtal. I know that I raised him in the church and he will con\u00adtin\u00adue to have his morals and be dri\u00adven by his faith. Even though he is sick, he stil\u00adll grabs the mic to sing on the stage. In those mo\u00adments, I am proud of how I raised him. He is strong, I am con\u00adfi\u00addent that he al\u00adready knows what is right and wrong at this young age. Then Esau looked up and saw the women and chil\u00addren. \u201cWho are these with you?\u201d he asked. Ja\u00adcob an\u00adswered, \u201cThey are the chil\u00addren God has gra\u00adcious\u00adly giv\u00aden your ser\u00advant.\u201d Gen\u00ade\u00adsis 33:5 (NIV) ",

Dis\u00adre\u00adgard\u00ading whichev\u00ader jus\u00adti\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtions oth\u00aders can come up with, there is ab\u00adsolute\u00adly noth\u00ading wrong in be\u00ading paid to care for a loved one. Al\u00adlow me to paint a typ\u00adi\u00adcal care\u00adgiv\u00ading sce\u00adnario for you; you\u2019ve left your job, you have util\u00adi\u00adty bills to pay, you have to shop for gro\u00adceries, spe\u00adcif\u00adic meal plans to fol\u00adlow, med\u00adica\u00adtion, adult di\u00ada\u00adpers and spe\u00adcial oint\u00adments to pur\u00adchase, doc\u00adtor vis\u00adits to pay for and pos\u00adsi\u00adbly phys\u00adi\u00adcal ther\u00ada\u00adpy twice a week. You may be at the fi\u00adnal stage of your mort\u00adgage, have school or uni\u00adver\u00adsi\u00adty fees, have your own home, a loan and a ve\u00adhi\u00adcle to main\u00adtain\u2014this is just a drop in the buck\u00adet for some. Let\u2019s go a step fur\u00adther, you are al\u00adso di\u00ada\u00adbet\u00adic so you need your meds, high blood pres\u00adsure, your doc\u00adtor vis\u00adits, have house, ve\u00adhi\u00adcle, med\u00adical and life in\u00adsur\u00adance to pay and pos\u00adsi\u00adbly have your own home which you no longer live in full time. These cir\u00adcum\u00adstances can have a per\u00adson feel\u00ading like his or her en\u00adtire world is crash\u00ading down. Then, there\u2019s the fam\u00adi\u00adly dis\u00adcus\u00adsion. Your sib\u00adlings want to hire a care\u00adgiv\u00ader. In your head, all you can say is, \u201cWHAT!\u201d You just took ear\u00adly re\u00adtire\u00adment or were pos\u00adsi\u00adbly think\u00ading about tak\u00ading it to care for your loved one full-time, so what do you do? Well, why not sug\u00adgest to be paid? You have bills to pay so, why not make sure that you are meet\u00ading your com\u00admit\u00adments by treat\u00ading it as a job? With this arrange\u00adment, both your loved one and you will ben\u00ade\u00adfit. One thing I al\u00adways preach to any care\u00adgiv\u00ader is to write every\u00adthing down. As a fam\u00adi\u00adly care\u00adgiv\u00ader, we are ac\u00adcount\u00adable to log in\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtion in a book\u2014this helps us to in\u00adform the doc\u00adtor of any changes in our ca\u00adree. Log\u00adging your ca\u00adree\u2019s dai\u00adly rou\u00adtine and any\u00adthing else you deem rel\u00ade\u00advant will en\u00adable you to in\u00adform the ca\u00adree\u2019s fam\u00adi\u00adly so that they un\u00adder\u00adstand that you know what you are do\u00ading and are work\u00ading close\u00adly with their doc\u00adtors. You need to sell your\u00adself to fam\u00adi\u00adly mem\u00adbers. This gives them peace of mind and as\u00adsur\u00adance. Know\u00ading that it is not a bur\u00adden for you and that you have struc\u00adture and or\u00adder can put any\u00adone in op\u00adpo\u00adsi\u00adtion at ease. If you have a sys\u00adtem in place, you can go a step fur\u00adther and hire a care\u00adgiv\u00ader, once fi\u00adnances per\u00admit. You will be there to en\u00adsure that: prop\u00ader care is giv\u00aden, the care plan is fol\u00adlowed and tasks are per\u00adformed dai\u00adly and cor\u00adrect\u00adly. You can al\u00adso mon\u00adi\u00adtor how they in\u00adter\u00adact with the ca\u00adree and vice ver\u00adsa. This does not take away from you be\u00ading paid, but you may re\u00adalise that some\u00adone is on\u00adly re\u00adquired for a cer\u00adtain pe\u00adri\u00adod dur\u00ading the week. How much should I get paid to care for mom or dad? Care\u00adgivers can make be\u00adtween $20 to $30 an hour de\u00adpend\u00ading on their qual\u00adi\u00adfi\u00adca\u00adtions. In the case of a fam\u00adi\u00adly mem\u00adber, the fam\u00adi\u00adly can de\u00adcide on a fixed day rate of $250-$300, which cov\u00aders 24 hours. You can de\u00adcide charge on\u00adly for week\u00addays and take the week\u00adends un\u00adpaid or the op\u00adpo\u00adsite. There is flex\u00adi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty with how dis\u00adcus\u00adsion and pay\u00adment can go. You can de\u00adcide if out of what you are re\u00adceiv\u00ading, you\u2019d like to pay some\u00adone to come in and do the house\u00adwork or re\u00adlieve you dur\u00ading the day. You have con\u00adtrol over how this works for you, but every de\u00adci\u00adsion must be made in the best in\u00adter\u00adest of the ca\u00adree. Now folks, don\u2019t go rip\u00adping off your fam\u00adi\u00adly mem\u00adbers. I know you are do\u00ading the phys\u00adi\u00adcal car\u00ading, but put your\u00adself out of the equa\u00adtion. Re\u00admem\u00adber, this is a con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion with the fam\u00adi\u00adly. You can hear them out first, find out what they are able to af\u00adford and based on that, you can ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adate. There are many fam\u00adi\u00adly care\u00adgivers that are stressed, not on\u00adly emo\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly or phys\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly, but fi\u00adnan\u00adcial\u00adly. They are try\u00ading to do every\u00adthing from their life sav\u00adings (if any), par\u00adent\u2019s pen\u00adsion or their re\u00adtire\u00adment fund. Why should it be like this? Well, I think it is be\u00adcause many of us have failed to pre\u00adpare and plan for old age, ill\u00adness and care and re\u00adcov\u00adery. You may al\u00adso be in a fam\u00adi\u00adly where like me, you are the on\u00adly child. So, what is the plan for pay\u00adment? First\u00adly, con\u00adtact the Di\u00advi\u00adsion of Age\u00ading and in\u00adquire, if mom or dad qual\u00adi\u00adfy for a pen\u00adsion and if there are any dis\u00adabil\u00adi\u00adty grants that are ap\u00adplic\u00ada\u00adble to their con\u00addi\u00adtion. Care\u00adgivers, I beg you to stop let\u00adting your pride get in the way, these grants and pen\u00adsion plans are meant to as\u00adsist per\u00adsons in need. No one be\u00adsides the agency will know you are get\u00adting this un\u00adless you go blab\u00adbing to every\u00adone. So, if you have a big ego or, as we say, \u2018false pride\u2019, qui\u00adet\u00adly fill out and sub\u00admit your forms and with a great big smile on your face, col\u00adlect your mon\u00adey at the end of each month. Any as\u00adsis\u00adtance you re\u00adceive, take it, as it is bet\u00adter to have some\u00adthing rather than noth\u00ading at all. Re\u00admem\u00adber, this is a team ef\u00adfort; all par\u00adties need to be in\u00advolved and, as much as pos\u00adsi\u00adble, on the same page. En\u00adsure you have the rel\u00ade\u00advant ev\u00adi\u00addence like your log book, to show that you are the best per\u00adson for this po\u00adsi\u00adtion and why it makes more sense to pay you, rather than a stranger. Are you a Fam\u00adi\u00adly Care\u00adgiv\u00ader? Or Were you a Fam\u00adi\u00adly Care\u00adgiv\u00ader? ALL are Wel\u00adcomed.

CHAMPIONS AGAIN: Queen\u2019s Park Cricket Club celebrate with the Sunday League 50 overs trophy following their victory over First Citizens Clarke Road United in Sunday\u2019s final at Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba. QUEEN\u2019S PARK Cricket Club would have been looking for more of a challenge in the Premiership T20 final on Friday night but they are still pretty ecstatic after romping to their fifth title on Friday night. The stage was set for a \u201cNorth versus South\u201d final at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba and while the Penal-based First Citizens Clarke United were closer to home and had a few seasoned players in their ranks, they were no match for the giants of the North. Set a below par 131 to win, the Parkites cruised to an emphatic nine-wicket victory with 7.5 overs to spare, with skipper Justin Guillen delivering for the second night in a row with an unbeaten 57 and Tion Webster smashing 54. Queen\u2019s Park coach David Furlonge was pleased with the season ending victory, given the way the domestic Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board season began. West Indies used plenty of short-pitched deliveries to dismantle Pakistan in their Cricket World Cup opener but the Caribbean batsmen will get a taste of their own medicine when they face champions Australia, fast bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile has said. Fresh from scoring her maiden Twenty20 International century, West Indies Women vice-captain Hayley Matthews said she was extremely satisfied with both her and the team\u2019s performances during their tour of Ireland. The Stories of Success (SOS) Basketball Academy got their season off to a perfect start with an 80-58 win over the Success Village Pythons in the first game of the Men\u2019s Division One East Zone Basketball Commission (EZBC) 2019 Championship on Thursday. GARRY SIEWDASS turned in a stunning performance to steal the spotlight on the fourth and final day of the Steve Thomas International Tennis Tournament at National Racquet Centre, Orange Grove Main Road, Tacarigua, yesterday. Having demolished Pakistan to get their World Cup campaign underway, the West Indies must prepare for a double-barrelled response when they take on Australia on Thursday.

Local government councillor Chris Hosein with a police officer holding some of the marijuana plants found at the school. A protest at the unfinished Reform Hindu School turned into a police investigation on Friday. Parents entered the compound overgrown with bushes and discovered several marijuana plants. Inside the classroom, parents found a makeshift bed, two chairs and a clothing line. Local government councillor Chris Hosein, who accompanied parents, said he was informed that a man claiming to be a security guard was seen on the compound. But he was uncertain who hired the security guard. There were pieces of clothing on the line and a small radio was on the bed. Hosein said no one was inside the building when they arrived. In another classroom, parents found a kitchen outfitted with stove and utensils. But parents were furious when they discovered several marijuana plants on the compound, he said. The Gasparillo police were contacted and the plants were uprooted. \u201cThis morning it is with a heavy heart that I join the understandably frustrated members of the PTA of the Reform Hindu School as yet again we are clamouring for the Government to complete the new Reform Hindu School which was started under the PP (People\u2019s Partnership) government and abandoned by this Government,\u201d he said. The new school was 95 per cent completed when the People\u2019s National Movement (PNM) was elected to office in 2015, Hosein said. Hosein said pupils were currently cramped in small classrooms located on the compound of the Reform Shiva Mandir. He said it is clear the Government had no interest in looking after the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago \u201cas our children continue to suffer\u201d. Parents have held numerous protests in recent years. \u201cAfter several protests and attempts of reaching out to the Minister of Education with nothing but broken promises, I am now calling on the Prime Minister to adjust his priorities and demand that the Reform Hindu School be completed and opened,\u201d he said. And should no action be taken, Hosein said, parents were prepared to take further protest action. Minister in the Ministry of Education Dr Lovell Francis said he was not aware of the discovery. Francis was unable to confirm whether a security guard was stationed at the school. In a text message to the Express, Francis said, \u201cThanks for the update.

The Hall of Justice, Port of Spain MURDER indictments that were filed against three men by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for a triple killing in 2009, were today quashed by the High Court judge, resulting in the former accused walking free without a trial taking place. The three men were released by Justice Devan Rampersad at the Hall of Justice in Port of Spain this afternoon, after another judge ruled in a judicial review claim that the decision of the DPP\u2019s Office to continue prosecuting them was unfair, unreasonable and improper. Those freed were: Chris Durham, Deon Calliste and Ian Salandy. They were accused of murdering Khenti Murai, Mubarak Calder and Kevon St Louis in April 2009. Last week, a team of attorneys representing the men, filed a claim for judicial review to have the indictments quashed after the prosecution disclosed to them that the State\u2019s main witness had confessed he fabricated evidence against the men at the Magistrates\u2019 Court and had the intention of again doing so when the matter goes to trial at the High Court. But in spite of this, the DPP\u2019s Office decided it was moving ahead with the prosecution.

A WOMAN who allegedly facilitated a sexual act between a 13-year-old girl and a 27-year-old man was ordered to stay away from the alleged victim as she faced the court on Friday. Cashier Sharline Samaroo, 25 of Barrackpore, appeared before Rio Claro senior magistrate Rae Roopchand charged with causing a child to engage in an activity which is sexual under the Children\u2019s Act, on a date unknown in February 2019. It alleged occurred in a bedroom at her house after the child was taken there earlier this year. The indictable charge, under the Children\u2019s Act, was laid by constable Rajkumar of the Child Protection Unit. Samaroo was not called upon to enter a plea. Roopchand granted her $20,000 bail with the condition that she stays away and has no communication with the alleged victim and reports to the Barrackpore police station twice a week. Samaroo was ordered to return to court on June 28.

A BRIDE and groom in Central Trinidad pledged love and commitment to each other in their wedding on Saturday, then distributed meals to the homeless after the wedding reception. Crystal Paltoo was still dressed in wedding gown and Michael Thong-Kiaw in his three-piece suit and tie when they took to the streets of Chaguanas and handed out the meals around midnight. The couple are volunteers with Love All Serve All, a soup kitchen that serves food packages to the street dwellers. Paltoo and Thong-Kiaw are the owners of food outlet Cutters Express in Endeavour in Chaguanas. And after they met the soup-kitchen\u2019s manager Srishti Ramdass about a year ago, they joined in the venture. Ramdass said that Love All Serve All soup kitchen originated in Port of Spain in 2017, beginning with 300 meals per night. Another branch later opened in Longdenville, and Paltoo and Thong-Kiaw have become core members of the soup-kitchen. Thong-Kiaw said he did not know that the photographs were taken and posted on Love All Serve All\u2019s Facebook page until he and his new bride got home that night. Ramdass wrote in the post that since the planning stages of the wedding, the couple came up with the idea of sharing their wedding meals with the homeless. The post from read: \u201cWedding Day... A day in celebration of love and Commitment. Well a couple from our Central Kitchen really displayed these two pillars on their wedding day. In the planning stages of their wedding, they really wanted to include the distribution of meals to our Hungry on the Streets as part of their Special Day. However, it never seemed to pan out whether or not it would be disrespectful to the guests in attendance. It\u2019s said that a dream is a wish your heart makes and this definitely had to a be a dream come true because what their heart wished for, it came to reality. Things just fell into place. It had to be some sort of Divine Intervention at play. Kudos to Crystal & Mike for their continued support to our Central Kitchen in being part of this Offering of Love, To Love, From Love and coincidentally on a day celebrating love. Last but not least, congrats to you both on your special day and may you be blessed to continue on this path of love & service\u201d. In a telephone interview with Express on Monday, Thong-Kiaw said he and his bride held a small wedding and there was a surplus of food after the 70 guests had eaten and given take away boxes. \u201cThere was so much food and soup remaining and I hate to see food spoil and waste. We decided to go on the usual route where we would hand out the meals. It was after 12 in the night and the food finished in no time\u201d, said Thong-Kiaw. \u201cWe enjoy helping people and we didn\u2019t want to give anyone the task of giving out the food. It was our wedding and our food, so why not\u201d. \u201cThe people receiving the food told my wife she looked so beautiful. They know us, but we just looked a little different\u201d, the groom laughed. Thong-Kiaw said that he and his wife feel uplifted through their volunteer work. \u201cThe people are so grateful, so nice and many are very talented. I have no idea why people shun them. It is amazing as to how people treat them. When you build a relationship with them, and talk to them you realise that they are regular people who were trying to make an honest dollar but life dealt them some bad cards. Many of them do not even have a criminal record. Some made some bad choices, and some were not able to handle things too well and found themselves on the street\u201d, he said. \u201cOver the past year we saw how much these meals mean to them (street dwellers). They are so happy to know that people still care and people are willing to help them in whatever form or fashion. We didn\u2019t know they were taking the photos, but if they help to inspire others to participate in helping that made it worthwhile\u201d, said the groom.

I have found it interesting recently that the \u201cbig parties\u201d seem to be following the smaller ones. For example, the Prime Minister\u2019s recent comments concerning events surrounding the spate of decisions on the Freedom of Information Act are instructive. He is quoted as saying that \u201cthere should be more transparency regarding information to the public.\u201d He is basically echoing the sentiments expressed by the political leader of the Congress of the People (COP) who called for certain Cabinet notes to be made public. It is interesting that after four years of secrecy regarding the closing of Petrotrin, the failed Sandals project, the Dragon Field deal and many others, the Prime Minister conveniently considers this a possibility. This is a little too late, Mr Prime Minister. In spite of your party\u2019s bravado, it is unlikely the country will realise the reform you promised. The only parties that seem genuine about the governance issues seem to be the smaller ones. After the relaunch of the COP, the political leader asked for the parties to declare their unexplained wealth, and the Minister of Communication soon after declared that campaign finance reform will be tabled. To date, no such bill has been laid. Instead, the whistle-blower legislation failed. Transparency in governance remains an elusive dream under both major parties. The COP is also leading the opposition as well; the Opposition Leader on a radio programme spoke to the issue of climate change. It is instructive to note that the COP was the first party to declare that it would introduce a national sustainable development master plan which is apolitical and an act of Parliament which focuses on the social, economic and environmental issues. The party has declared that it has recognised the frequency of disasters and that the time has come for climate change to be a main focus of concern and be part of the economic indicators going forward. The Opposition Leader has now also come out with some sort of economic transformational master plan. With the recently formed Patriotic Front along with the Movement for Social Justice, the message of good governance and constitutional change seems front and centre while the major parties, funded by big business, avoid the issue altogether or, at the very least, pay lip service to these ideals. The COP has been the only party to declare a policy on party financing. It may be unto something here. It might just make sense to take a closer look, after all it seems to be emerging as the template that all others are following. Maybe it is time for the people to have their voices heard through this party. Maybe it is time to stand up to those big anonymous business interests that have been pulling the strings of governments past and present to the detriment of the citizens at large. Lastly, the COP has been having discussions about decentralisation via e-government services and shorter working hours and I have noticed that some of the chambers, inclusive of the American Chamber, are now hosting forum discussions on this too. I for one am looking and listening more carefully and will no longer be hoodwinked by smooth talk and empty promises.

This image posted on social media shows Raj Sonnylal being attended to after being pulled from the water. LIFEGUARDS protesting health and safety issues at their headquarters have been staying away from duties at the Maracas beach. As a result, there was no immediate help for a Penal man when be began floundering in the water on Sunday. Lifeguards from the neighbouring beach at Las Cuevas were called to assist. They arrived half an hour after the Raj Sonnylal was brought ashore. A police report said that Sonnylal, 29, of Penal, was bathing with relatives in the bay when around 11.15 a.m. when they got into difficulties. His relatives made it out the water, but noticed that Sonnylal was not with them. Relatives went looking for lifeguards, but were told that they were engaged in strike action. One of Sonnylal\u2019s relatives sought help from the Maracas police station, and returned with two officers. Sonnylal was seen floating near the shoreline around 11.35 a.m. and pulled out from the water. A team from the US Marines, including Dr Buffong, began cardio pulmonary resuscitation on Sonnylal, assisted by lifeguards of the las Cuevas lifeguard station. An Emergency Health Services ambulance took Sonnylal to the Port of Spain General Hospital where doctors attended to him. He is warded on the Intensive Care Unit. National Union of Government and Federated Workers (NUGFW) representative for the lifeguards Augustus Sylvester told Express that there are numerous health and safety issues at the facilities at the lifeguard quarters at Maracas, and lifeguards have opted to stay away. Sylvester said that under the current PNM administration, the lifeguard division was moved from the charge of the Ministry of Tourism, to the Ministry of National Security. Sylvester said that among the health and safety issues were the dead rats and bat droppings in the building, malfunctioning toilets, with one of them clogged and sewage flooding the toilet area, faulty water pump, and no air conditioning. The lifeguards, who are scheduled to work from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. instead sign the register, stay a few hours on the job and leave, Sylvester said. \u201cThe issues that were raised with the ministry of national security for some time now and no attempts have been made to deal with these issues. It is unsafe for the workers to operate from that building. For the last three weeks the lifeguards are going to sign the book and remain a short while then depart from the building\u201d, said Sylvester. \u201cUnfortunately there is a guy right now who is fighting for his life at hospital because there were no lifeguards on duty.

Taken to police station: A member of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, right, assists in the loading of items belonging to some Venezuelan migrants who were found in a camp in Santa Flora. BOATLOADS of Venezuelans continue to arrive in Trinidad seeking the chance to be registered, says Cedros councillor Shankar Teelucksingh. According to Teelucksingh, as soon as the boats dock along the various illegal ports of entry on Trinidad\u2019s south western peninsula, migrants are being transported by buses to the San Fernando registration centre to be processed. Speaking to the Express yesterday, Teelucksingh said with the Cedros Security Complex no longer processing ferries transporting Venezuelans at the port, the desperate foreign nationals fleeing their homeland are arriving in large numbers hoping for the opportunity to be registered. The nearest centre for Venezuelans coming from south is at Achievors Banquet Hall in San Fernando. The registration process began on May 31 and will continue until June 14. The other centres are at Queen\u2019s Park Oval in Port of Spain and at the Caroline Building in Tobago. \u201cThe port in Cedros remains closed for ferries being Venezuelans legally into Trinidad while the other illegal ports of entry remain open. There are no checks and balances from the authorities to stop these vessels coming to Icacos, Chatham, Bamboo Beach, St Ann\u2019s Beach, the Granville Beach, Santa Flora, Erin and those areas remain open for the illegal Venezuelans. More and more Venezuelans are coming in by the boatloads throughout and the authorities are turning a blind eye,\u201d he said. Teelucksingh said over the weekend police intercepted a 25-seater maxi taxi carrying the newly arrived Venezuelan nationals and when taken to the nearest Immigration office, he said the officials gave the Venezuelans the registration forms. There were approximately 150 Venezuelans who entered the country over the weekend, said Teelucksingh. He said: \u201cWhat happened over the weekend was the police intercepted the maxi-taxi, took them down to Immigration and what happened next was Immigration just gave them these migrants the forms to go and get the work permit. And it is encouraging more of these illegals migrants to come in.\u201d Teelucksingh said the entire system of monitoring the Venezuelans entering the country has gone unchecked and has reached a point where it is now uncontrolled. \u201cNobody is trying to put a stop to who is coming in or turning them back, or if there is a cut-off point. We are not hearing anything from the Ministry of National Security or Labour. Right now the whole system is unchecked and uncontrolled because of the amount of people coming in now from the South West peninsula,\u201d he said. Teelucksingh expressed concern that there would be significant job loss for his constituents with the number of Venezuelans arriving. He said medications is already difficult for residents to collect. \u201cFor the average citizen who seek employment now have to compete with the Venezuelans and the Minister of Labour needs to break her silence on this. I continue to say that there should be an assessment done with the shortfall of labour in Trinidad and Tobago in those sectors we need to import example the medical department. In the South West peninsula we are seeing a shortage of residents getting medication. The Minister of Health continue to hoodwink the population saying that we have enough to deal with any crisis that should come up at the hospitals. The health centres don\u2019t have the basic medications people need and we need help,\u201d he said. Speaking during a visit to the Port of Spain registration office on Thursday, National Security Minister Stuart Young said the Ministry has increased its resources regarding patrols along the borders. \u201cOver the past month or so, we had increased the number of assets, the available assets down in the maritime borders of Trinidad and Tobago both down in the South as well as up in the north. I don\u2019t want to get into the operational side so then persons would know what we are trying to do and then they may try to avoid it. What I can tell is that we are utilising as much of the asserts that we have as possible that including our radar system, all of our boats and vessels, the Venezuelan authorities themselves have also stepped up on their side of the border with their patrols as well. The port of Cedros, never didn\u2019t open, but at the end of the day you have to understand from the national Security point of view our priority is to secure Trinidad and Tobago and our citizens of Trinidad and Tobago. So when there are patrols going out there, they will continue to do what it is they are doing, he said. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley announced on Thursday that his Cabinet took a decision to exempt migrants from paying NIS. He added that the Government will not give an extension for registration of Venezuelans.

This image posted on social media shows Raj Sonnylal being attended to after being pulled from the water. LIFEGUARDS protesting health and safety issues at their headquarters have been staying away from duties at the Maracas beach. As a result, there was no immediate help for a Penal man when he began floundering in the water on Sunday. Lifeguards from the neighbouring beach at Las Cuevas were called to assist. They arrived half an hour after the Raj Sonnylal was brought ashore. He died at hospital. A police report said that Sonnylal, 29, of Penal, was bathing with relatives in the bay when around 11.15 a.m. when they got into difficulties. His relatives made it out the water, but noticed that Sonnylal was not with them. Relatives went looking for lifeguards, but were told that they were engaged in strike action. One of Sonnylal\u2019s relatives sought help from the Maracas police station, and returned with two officers. Sonnylal was seen floating near the shoreline around 11.35 a.m. and pulled out from the water. A team from the US Marines, including Dr Buffong, began cardio pulmonary resuscitation on Sonnylal, assisted by lifeguards of the las Cuevas lifeguard station. An Emergency Health Services ambulance took Sonnylal to the Port of Spain General Hospital where doctors attended to him. He was warded on the Intensive Care Unit but died overnight. National Union of Government and Federated Workers (NUGFW) representative for the lifeguards Augustus Sylvester told Express that there are numerous health and safety issues at the facilities at the lifeguard quarters at Maracas, and lifeguards have opted to stay away. Sylvester said that under the current PNM administration, the lifeguard division was moved from the charge of the Ministry of Tourism, to the Ministry of National Security. Sylvester said that among the health and safety issues were the dead rats and bat droppings in the building, malfunctioning toilets, with one of them clogged and sewage flooding the toilet area, faulty water pump, and no air conditioning. The lifeguards, who are scheduled to work from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. instead sign the register, stay a few hours on the job and leave, Sylvester said. \u201cThe issues that were raised with the ministry of national security for some time now and no attempts have been made to deal with these issues. It is unsafe for the workers to operate from that building. For the last three weeks the lifeguards are going to sign the book and remain a short while then depart from the building\u201d, said Sylvester. \u201cUnfortunately there is a guy right now who is fighting for his life at hospital because there were no lifeguards on duty. Someone saw the incident and called one of the lifeguards in the area, and that is how the lifeguards from Las Cuevas responded. I was told that the man washed ashore and foreign military persons came and were doing CPR on him. The lifeguards from Las Cuevas came and operated on him until they took him to the hospital\u201d, he said. \u201cThe ministry is not doing anything to settle these issues.

Every year, nearly one in ten people in the world (an estimated 600 million people) fall ill and 420,000 die after eating food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances. Unsafe food also hinders development in many low- and middle-income economies, which lose around US$95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability, and premature death suffered by workers. The first ever celebration of the United Nations World Food Safety Day, marked globally on June 7, aimed to strengthen efforts to ensure that the food we eat is safe. Sheldon Blackman has carved out his slice of paradise in the reclusive hills of Oslo, Norway. Blackman, son of the late soca inventor Ras Shorty I (Garfield Blackman), owns, lives and farms half an acre of the sloping mountain side in the Norwegian Svart Skog\u2014Black Forrest. HAVE you ever felt that after years spent waiting and hoping to meet someone special, everyone seems to be finding love except you? \u201cHey mister, is this the way to Castara?\u201d I was driving a rental car in Tobago en route hopefully to the beautiful scenic rural fishing village of Castara. A seaside spot on the leeward coast of Tobago, Castara\u2019s economy is dependent primarily on fishing and agriculture, with tourism playing an increasingly important role since the 1990s. Times are hard and for many there seems no respite on the horizon. Trinidadians, however, still deserve to enjoy life as best they can and to also celebrate special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and more. Of course with the present state of the economy, it is difficult to host lavish events. To say Christiania is an unusual place would be a huge understatement. The small village, about 19 acres in size, is located in the heart of the Danish capital of Copenhagen. It is home to about 1,000 people who choose to live outside societal norms and structure. ",

The fact one of them is play\u00ading for Eng\u00adland makes it more in\u00adtrigu\u00ading.

West In\u00addies coach Floyd Reifer said Archer \"made his choice.\" Now he's go\u00ading to have to live with it. The 24-year-old Archer is set to lead the Eng\u00adland at\u00adtack against the West In\u00addies on Fri\u00adday, a show\u00addown that will be in the spot\u00adlight. Archer was the toast of Lon\u00addon af\u00adter tak\u00ading three wick\u00adets against South Africa in Eng\u00adland's tour\u00adna\u00adment-open\u00ading win, and has six wick\u00adets so far at the World Cup. The West In\u00addies have had plen\u00adty of choice in the pace de\u00adpart\u00adment, with skip\u00adper Ja\u00adson Hold\u00ader work\u00ading with Shel\u00addon Cot\u00adtrell, An\u00addre Rus\u00adsell, Os\u00adhane Thomas and Car\u00adlos Brath\u00adwaite to bounce out Pak\u00adistan for 105 and then cause de\u00adfend\u00ading cham\u00adpi\u00adon Aus\u00adtralia all kinds of trou\u00adble ear\u00adly be\u00adfore slip\u00adping to a 15-run loss.

The Windies will take a 1-1-1 record back to Hamp\u00adshire on Fri\u00adday to face Eng\u00adland, which has two wins and a loss. While Archer has been a rev\u00ade\u00adla\u00adtion to oc\u00adca\u00adsion\u00adal crick\u00adet fans in Eng\u00adland, he has long been on the watch list for se\u00adlec\u00adtors be\u00adcause of his Eng\u00adlish-born fa\u00adther.

He is from Bar\u00adba\u00addos,\" said Reifer, who played crick\u00adet against a younger Archer in Bar\u00adba\u00addos. \"Yes, he's bowl\u00ading quick\u00adly, but there's noth\u00ading that we are not ac\u00adcus\u00adtomed to.\" Eng\u00adland has nev\u00ader won the Crick\u00adet World Cup, but is the No. 1-ranked team and was pre-tour\u00adna\u00adment fa\u00advorite to win on home soil. The West In\u00addies were the orig\u00adi\u00adnal kings of one-day crick\u00adet, win\u00adning the first two World Cups and reach\u00ading the fi\u00adnal in 1983. They haven't been back to the fi\u00adnal since. Reifer not\u00aded that Archer had some in\u00adjuries as a young, de\u00advel\u00adop\u00ading pace man learn\u00ading the craft but al\u00adways showed he had the tal\u00adent to play in\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal crick\u00adet. \"Def\u00adi\u00adnite\u00adly.

        "CONTENT": "Finance Minister Colm Imbert Former Central Bank Governor Jwala Rambarran {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. Finance Minister Colm Imbert FORMER Central Bank governor Jwala Rambarran says it has now been proven that Finance Minister Colm Imbert\u2019s \u201cpetty and irrational vendetta\u201d against him was reason why an offer of employment that was extended to him with the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G-24), was withdrawn in 2016. Rambarran said Imbert directly intervened and prevented him from being appointed as a senior advisor with the G-24 secretariat, a position for which he had applied and was offered following his dismissal as governor of the Central Bank the previous year. Two weeks ago, High Court judge Justice Frank Seepersad ordered that Imbert disclose any correspondence he sent to Marilou Uy, director of the G-24 Secretariat, as it pertains to Rambarran prior to the offer to him being withdrawn. Rambarran had filed a lawsuit against Imbert after the minister initially refused to disclose the correspondence even though Rambarran had made a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Justice Seepersad, in delivering his ruling in favour of Rambarran, gave Imbert seven days in which to disclose the information. That information was disclosed one week ago. In a release issued on Sunday, Rambarran said the disclosure showed that Imbert \u201cintervened and interfered in the recruitment process to prevent me from assuming the prestigious position of Senior Advisor to the G-24 Secretariat.\u201d He stated, the correspondence showed that Uy had informed the minister that he (Rambarran) was unanimously selected as the highest ranked and most suitable candidate for the position that he had applied. Former Central Bank Governor Jwala Rambarran \u201cDirector Marilou Uy emphasized that this was a technical appointment with the G-24 Secretariat, not a political one representing the interests of any government, including Trinidad and Tobago. However, the offer for the position to which I had applied, interviewed and was accepted was rescinded on 29th December 2016 after Mr. Imbert\u2019s intervention which included a telephone call to the Director. \u201cImbert\u2019s pettiness and political blinders prevented me as a private citizen from working for a respected international institution in a capacity that would have been very beneficial to the international image of Trinidad and Tobago at a time when his mishandling of the economy requires maximum external support from experts with the proper training and expertise,\u201d he stated. Rambarran went further to say that his \u201cunceremonious dismissal\u201d as Central Bank governor was not enough for Imbert, since the minister felt compelled \u201cto complete my personal destruction by ensuring that I remain unemployed, even if I was the best candidate for the job and could do my country proud at an international level.\u201d \u201cIncidentally while Minister Imbert preoccupies himself playing piddly games with me instead of trying to revive our failing and battered economy, I will not. I could have issued contempt of court proceedings against Mr. Imbert as he provided these documents in two sets, one within the deadline fixed by the Court and one outside the deadline. \u201cBut I will not make a fuss about the missed deadline and jump at the chance to have him in contempt. That\u2019s the sort of petty manoeuvre I\u2019ll leave for the Minister, after all he needs all the help he can get, given his failures at not only trying to destroy me but also as a Minister of Finance,\u201d Rambarran stated.

Venezuelans outside the Queens Park Oval registration centre in Port of Spain on Sunday. https://bit.ly/2MEjOdR The Government\u2019s registration programme for Venezuelan migrants has been welcomed by that country\u2019s ambassador to Trinidad and \u00adTobago, \u00adCarlos Perez, who said yesterday the embassy has not interfered in the \u00adprocess so far. Speaking to I95 FM, Perez praised the State\u2019s move to regularise some of those fleeing the troubled Latin Ameri\u00adcan neighbour amid economic and \u00adpolitical turmoil, saying the programme gave them a chance to work while \u00adbeing protected by the State. Venezuelans lined up in the rain outside the Achievor's Banquet Hall registration centre in San Fernando on Sunday. Photo: TREVOR WATSON While stating the decision to leave Venezuela was \u201ca personal one\u201d, Perez also left some questions\u2014such as whether a cap should be placed on the \u00adnumber of migrants allowed into T&T\u2014up to the Government. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good initiative from the Government of T&T,\u201d Perez told the radio station. He noted the process, which began on May 31 and ends on Friday, allows migrants and those claiming refugee status to regularise their status and seek gainful employment for up to a year, while under the protection of the law. Further, those successful in the registration process will likely be able to apply for T&T citizenship or obtain a work permit. Asked whether the T&T Government should place a cap on the number of migrants allowed into T&T, Perez said: \u201cThat answer should come from the Government of Trinidad and \u00adTobago.\u201d Perez said migration was a personal decision, and was not within the control of any government. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you migrate, it\u2019s a personal decision,\u201d he said. Perez was also asked to address Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar\u2019s stated support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who in January declared himself interim presi\u00addent and called for President Nicolas Maduro to step down. \u201cThe only thing I can say is there is only one president in Venezuela and that is Nicolas Maduro,\u201d Perez stated. However, as he represents the government of Venezuela, Perez said he is able to \u201csit\u201d with anyone in T&T \u201cwithout a problem\u201d. The ambassador said he would be open to meeting with Persad-Bissessar. He went on to state his support for the position of \u201cnon-intervention\u201d into Venezuela\u2019s sovereign affairs adopted by the T&T Government and Caricom. No interference While he has not visited any of the Government\u2019s three registration centres in Port of Spain, San Fernando and Scarborough, Perez said the embassy has noted the process is an internal one, but is being monitored by the embassy. Free food was shared at the Achievor's Banquet Hall registration centre in San Fernando on Sunday. Photo: TREVOR WATSON \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create any disruption,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe will see. Maybe you will see me around sometime before the process ends.\u201d Perez, who arrived here on May 31, was hopeful the Montevideo mechanism, established between Caricom and the governments of Mexico and Uruguay, would eventually lead to a peaceful resolution for his country. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s like the light at the end of the tunnel of this process,\u201d he said. He said social media content in Venezuela has also shown that Guaid\u00f3 does not have total support within the opposition, and that there are \u201cdissenting voices\u201d. As for reports of police and military brutality against protesting citizens in Venezuela, Perez said police officers and soldiers who used excessive force against citizens during protests have been jailed, pending investigations. Saying only the Venezuelan \u00adpeople could decide their president\u2014either in the next presidential election or through a referendum\u2014Perez said efforts to oust Maduro were tied to attempts to take control of that country\u2019s vast natural resources. He said the Venezuelan constitution provided all the mechanisms needed for the Venezuelan people to make that decision, and chided that United States sanctions on his country were \u00adworsening an already difficult situation.

The Estate Police Association (EPA) said it warned Trinidad Petroleum Holdings\u2019 (TPH) chairman Wilfred Espinet that there would be theft and massive loss of assets following the termination of the estate police officers at now defunct State-owned oil company Petrotrin.

How was Trinidad and Tobago able to avoid the economic collapse that has afflicted its nearest neighbour, Venezuela, while the latter has fared very badly from the fluctuations in oil prices?

        "CONTENT": "WRONG INFO: Former Caribbean Airlines chairman George Nicholas WRONG INFO: Former Caribbean Airlines chairman George Nicholas Caribbean Airlines Ltd (CAL) recorded a consolidated unaudited loss of US$52.8 million (TT$339.5 million) for 2011, while Air Jamaica recorded an unaudited loss of US$38.1 million (TT$ 245.2 million). This is what Finance Minister Winston Dookeran told the House of Representatives yesterday. The Minister's statement puts into serious question the claim of the airline's profit made by former CAL chairman George Nicholas, who had stated last November that CAL raked in a $200 million profit for 2011 and that Air Jamaica, after the merger, had also made its first ever consecutive profit in its 50-year history. As he welcomed the first of nine new aircraft, Nicholas had painted a rosy picture of the State enterprise, boasting that CAL was able to \"put millions into the treasury\" and that \"CAL was a profitable organisation\". He had said: \"We are doing things differently... It has been a very tough year, but Caribbean Airlines is flying routes to make money.\" Dookeran's revelations yesterday, however, portrayed a totally different picture of CAL as a loss-making enterprise, facing mounting debt. The Minister stated that the debts of Caribbean Airlines Ltd as at March 15, 2012, were over US$40 million (TT$256 million). The Minister said CAL's individual debts, which were greater than TT$2 million as at March 15, 2012, were as follows: Airports Authority of Trinidad and Tobago US$8,120,807; US taxes payable to the Internal Revenue Service US$6,129,621; National Petroleum (fuel), Norman Manley International Airport US$3,850,000; International Air Transport Association (IATA) US$3,500,000; Automated Clearing House/Custom and Excise Passenger Taxes US$3,152,832; Strategic Air Services (cargo handling) US$2,104,581; Boeing (maintenance) US$2,058,288; Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) US$1,892,000; Value Added Tax (BIR) US$1,734,375 AON Insurance (passenger and aircraft) US$1,283,980; Synergy Aviation (aircraft parts) US$933,250; Ross Advertising US$544,829. Dookeran also stated that while the board of directors of CAL approved US$5 million, which was pledged to the Children's Life Fundas at March 15, 2012, only US$200,000 had been remitted to the Fund. CAL had presented a large replica cheque for US$5 million to Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar at the official launch of the fund in November. The Prime Minister had explained then that CAL had raised the money by donating US$5 on every passenger ticket. Dookeran also stated that the total subsidy for the fuel provided to CAL as at March 15, 2012, was TT$141,222,702. He said TT$40,553,313 of this $141 million was outstanding. On the issue of Air Jamaica, the Minister said Cabinet had agreed to the extension of the fuel hedge mechanism for CAL to cover the period January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, at the benchmark fuel price of US$1.50 per gallon for Caribbean Airlines and US$2.34 per gallon for Air Jamaica operations. He said to date, CAL had submitted claims for the Air Jamaica operations in the amount of US $3,189,061 for the period January to March 31, 2012, of which payment can only be made after the claims are audited by the Central Audit Committee of the Ministry of Finance. He added that the claims for the Air Jamaica operations for 2012 were currently being audited. The Minister was responding to questions filed by Opposition Leader Dr Keith Rowley, who asked Dookeran whether he was aware the CAL board had declared to the country that it made a profit and a percentage of this was given to the Children's Life Fund. Dookeran said he was not so aware. Rowley said he was \"shocked\" by what he was hearing from Dookeran. Last week, Leader of Government Business Dr Roodal Moonilal, in response to a question, revealed CAL spent $245,166.51 for Minister Devant Maharaj, $59,339 for his adviser and $185,976.60 for a CAL director to accompany the Prime Minister on her official trip to India. The airline has been discussing adding Mumbai to its flight schedule. Nicholas had an eventful tenure, having clashed with the first Transport Minister, Jack Warner. He survived a call by the board, the Transport Minister and Finance Minister to demit office. But it was not until last month (April 4) that his colourful stint ended after the Minister gave him (along with other State enterprise chairmen) a five out of ten rating for his performance as chairman.

THE mystery of the United States military plane parked at Piarco International Airport has been solved. And the story behind its visit is not as exciting as first thought. The giant plane, a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, was in Trinidad simply delivering cargo as it has been doing annually for more than a decade. Public affairs officer of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force Kirk Jean-Baptiste said that the plane arrived on Saturday, September 10 and was supposed to leave the same day. \u201cIt's nothing strange, it's nothing new. It's nothing invasive, nothing different than what we have been doing for the last ten or 15 years,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste. \u201cThe plane is like a bus. It brought supplies here and had supplies to carry wherever else it was supposed to go, but they would not lift off if they have a problem.\u201d Jean-Baptiste said that the presence of the plane had nothing to do with Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley's message to the nation the next day (September 11) that more investments are to be made to strengthen the Police Service. \u201cThat's just pure coincidence, because this has been planned almost a year ago. This had nothing to do with his message,\u201d he said. Jean-Baptiste said that training exercises with the US Army were usual in the areas of disaster preparedness, disaster relief, and evacuations. \u201cWe are doing joint training. They are teaching us and we are training them,\u201d said the public affairs officer. The plane was seen at Piarco International Airport last week Sunday and a photo of it parked on the runway was shared widely on social media. Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority Ramesh Lutchmedial, when contacted last week Monday, said he could not comment on the presence of the aircraft, considered one of the largest military aircraft in the world. \u201cI am not at liberty to say. That's a matter for the US government and the Ministry of National Security,\u201d said Lutchmedial.

        "CONTENT": "THE relatively rare heartening news out of the agriculture sector is a moment to cheer. As of now, green market shoppers are filling their baskets and enjoying prices far lower than were available after the last rainy season\u2019s severe storms that devastated not only homes but also farmers\u2019 garden plots, livestock, crops and equipment. As one shopper told Express reporter Leah Sorias last week, \u201cThis is the cheapest I have seen prices in a long time. I should probably knock on wood.\u201d It is not luck or good fortune, however, which affords the opportunity for shoppers to see their market money go a longer way. Agriculture, as a sector, has been blighted by lack of will and falling production as lands, such as those at the Government\u2019s St Joseph acreage once devoted to food cropping, are controversially designated for conversion into housing accommodation. Agriculture Minister Clarence Rambharat, whose portfolio receives the smallest portion of the annual national budget, seldom permits himself expressions of optimism as he confronts prospects not only of diminished activity but also of what often looks like political and national indifference. Standing among examples of botched will and dedicated indifference in this sector is the buffalypso, once a veterinary developmental success story bringing pride and joy to local livestock farming, now reduced to herds of doubtful acceptability, running wild in the southern bushes. Meanwhile, in Cuba, buffalypso developed on the Trinidad and Tobago model flourish in good health and productivity. Little or nothing remains to show for the efforts by the late sugar producer Caroni (1975) Ltd to diversify into food crop production. Former prime minister Patrick Manning\u2019s mega-farm vision blurred in a just a few short years while a People\u2019s Partnership announcement of deals with Guyana to utilise land there for farming by our nationals was never realised. Meanwhile, pirogue fishing to supply markets has been hit by significantly higher fuel prices and, lately, by the predatory attacks of Venezuelan pirates and kidnappers. For all the agriculture areas in which production has declined or disappeared, imports are relied on to the extent, it seems, that much food crop production is effectively outsourced to nearby Grenada and St Vincent. And the plight of rice farmers was recently exposed before a parliamentary Joint Select Committee. Such is the measure of being thankful for small mercies that Sahara dust, dreaded for its effects on those with respiratory challenges, is welcomed for its provision of chemical elements capable of enhancing soil quality. It is to the credit of those farmers who, defying last October\u2019s floods, have bounced back with produce so abundant as to be sellable cheaper than usual. In acknowledging the resilience of farmers and the temporary relief for consumers, we note the sad but familiar reality that Tobago is reported not to be benefiting from the newly attractive prices in Trinidad green markets.

        "CONTENT": " Part III In my last article I started discussion on the Minister of Food Production's presentation in the budget debate. He outlined the progress in rehabilitating rural access roads. Over the years, since 1987 when I first entered Parliament as an Independent Senator, (when this country had a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank for rehabilitation of rural access roads) I have listened to successive Ministers of Agriculture read out lists of such roads that have received attention under their watch. I have written on this topic in articles in the Express since 2002. After giving a total figure for the area of roads fixed, he could more usefully have spent his debating time in demonstrating how the food import bill will be reduced by $2 billion within three years. If we really consider agriculture to be important we should spend the $7 billion allocated for the new highway, and the resources of the construction sector which are being used in that project, in a meaningful effort to fix the problem of poor rural access roads. I fully support the effort in improving the fishing landing sites and it is good to learn that this effort will be completed by the end of 2012 and so that we will not need to have a recital of the various sites attended to in the next budget presentation. I am glad to note the Minister's efforts to link the School Feeding Programme more closely to farmers. Ever since the late Lloyd Best proposed that the School Feeding Programme could be an important market for local farmers produce I have urged this development. I have also pointed out that this provides an opportunity to subsidise local farmers by paying higher prices for high quality produce (after they have produced rather than the present wasteful system of subsidising aspects of the production process). Lloyd Best proposed, and I have fully supported at every opportunity, the extension of this system to all state-funded institutions such as hospitals. With respect to the School Feeding Programme, all students, not only those in need, should have meals at school provided by the School Feeding Programme. Those whose parents can afford it should pay for their meals. The Minister of Health should be fully in support of this for it would help to address the problem of obesity and other diseases affected by nutritional habits. These meals should be served in properly appointed dining-rooms in all schools. The number of schools in this country that have proper dining rooms could probably be counted on the fingers of one hand. With respect to irrigation, I am glad to learn that there will be an effort to introduce drip-irrigation systems. However I have reservation on the construction of ponds on individual farms since these will use up arable land. I would suggest that central or regional reservoirs be considered instead. Such decisions need to be part of overall planning for utilisation of water resources and not individual sector decisions. The Minister indicated the land that has been made available for farming. Even the total of the land referred to is but a relatively small proportion of the Caroni (1975) Ltd. agricultural land. As long as I am able to do so I shall continue to ask of which ever Government is in power: has all of the 68,599 acres of Caroni (1975) Ltd. agricultural land been used and if so how much has been used for agriculture A recent news item has stated that 800 acres of land that was given out as two-acre plots are to be farmed collectively by Caroni (1975) Ltd. on behalf of the Government. It appears that there will be agreement by which the plots are to be utilised by Government on behalf of the former Caroni workers. In a previous article in this series I referred to the difficulty of these two-acre plots coming into production. I did not know that Caroni (1975) Ltd. still existed and that it still employs agricultural staff (agronomists) etc. to undertake such a project. Given Caroni's history in high cost of sugarcane production I recommend that the Minister of Finance hold a close-watching brief on expenditure on this project. The Minister of Food Production referred to the issue of land tenure in the main to recount the alleged misdeeds of the previous Government. Why have land matters been transferred from the Ministry of Food Production to the Ministry of Housing My fear is that this move is meant to facilitate the transference of land from potential agricultural use to use for housing! I have not been able to glean from the Minister's presentation an overarching concept of how the agricultural sector will be developed or how the target of the reduction of the food import bill by $2 billion will be achieved. Since present local production of all agricultural produce is in the order of TT$900,000 this would require more than doubling present production in three years. I urge the Minister of Finance to use his management experience to do the simple arithmetic to calculate if this is possible given the crops and livestock that we are able to produce, the land area available and possible yields of the various commodities under local conditions (all of which data are available from publications). I ask him to make this information available to the public. In the meanwhile I hold him to his statement that Government will reduce the food import bill by $2 billion by 2015. I shall accept no excuses such as increase in price of food from external sources (these can be forecast), or climate change (this too can be forecast from existing trends). By systematic planning, backed up by the creation of highly trained (to tertiary level) farmers, a proper land use policy and a change in the mind-set of our leaders towards agriculture, we should, with time, be able to achieve some reduction in our food import bill.

        "CONTENT": " Last week I raised some issues on the \"Transformation Plan for the Agriculture Sector\" of the Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Marine Resources. This plan suggests protection and support for the Agricultural Sector within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. There are two areas for which substantial support can be given within the WTO rules and these are: Agricultural Services and Protection of the environment (including conservation of biological diversity). Certain aspects of these are not discussed in the plan so I shall discuss the former in this article and the latter subsequently. Agricultural services can include provision of infrastructure such as access roads, water for irrigation, and drainage, education and training of farmers, research on plant and livestock production, crop agronomy, pest and disease control, fertiliser requirements, soil and water management, and production of new crop varieties and breeds of livestock. Traditionally in our agricultural system some of these services have been provided in separate institutions, (for exampleteaching and research). Education: Education at tertiary level is being provided by the University of the West Indies (UWI) in programmes that are intended to produce farmers, extension workers and agricultural scientists whereas the Eastern Caribbean Institute of Agriculture and Forestry (ECIAF) produces agricultural technologists who could become middle level extension workers and farmers. Research: The main research services provided to farmers are currently the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture centred mainly at the Central Experimental Station at Centeno. I joined the staff of this division as a plant pathologist in 1954 (I transferred to UWI in 1963). In the 1950s the research staff consisted of some ten personsagronomists (rice, sugarcane, cocoa, fruit-cropsmainly citrus), an economic botanist for introduction of new varieties, a soil scientist, soil surveyors, a plant pathologist and an entomologist. The duties of these officers were mainly in research but included extension work either through district extension officers, or in some cases, directly to farmers.While there is an Agricultural Services Division in the Ministry of Agriculture my information is that gradually over the years much of the activities of the Central Experiment Station have been given over to providing services such as pest and disease control and soil analysis with a much smaller proportion of the activity of the station devoted to research. However, in order for there to be a vibrant and progressive agricultural sector, there must be the support of well-managed scientific research activity. Extension: Extension Services are provided by the Ministry of Agriculture through district extension officers, who should cooperate with the research division to obtain specialist knowledge as required. I have very great doubt as to the effectiveness of this linkage. Many district officers have much of their time tied up in regulatory procedures thus distracting from the main task of advising farmers on agricultural practices. A study undertaken by UWI some years ago revealed that the majority of farmers obtained their advice from the shops that sell agricultural chemicals, machinery, and other supplies. That this is still the case may be easily confirmed by spending half and hour in an agricultural shop listening to the advice given to farmers by the shop owner and staff. A very small minority of these shop staff have formal training in agriculture at a tertiary level. In addition to the district extension officers the Ministry has a very small specialist extension division that is also responsible for training of farmers by short courses. This model of providing agricultural services in research and extension in separate divisions derives from the British colonial tradition and differs markedly from the approach in the United States where the responsibility for tertiary level education, research and extension rests with the state agricultural colleges which are part of the University system. Proposals for the future: It is this United States concept that has been proposed for Trinidad and Tobago with the incorporation of ECIAF into the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) and transfer of the responsibility of the research activity of the Ministry of Agriculture to UTT. Since, as I have stated earlier, much of the activity of the Central Experiment Station now involves service rather than research the transfer of the research activity to UTT should cause no major upheaval since the other service responsibilities remain with the Ministry. If, as has been recommended, UTT creates a core programme for a degree in Agricultural Technology and fully accepts responsibility for research and transfer of technology (specialist extension) then there would be no conflict with activities with other institutions. The graduates with a degree in Agricultural Technology will in the main become farmers capable of developing livestock crops or mixed farming enterprises, whereas UWI will continue to produce agricultural scientists. While these are intended to be the main streams it clearly will not exclude some ECIAF graduates from becoming scientists after appropriate postgraduate courses or UWI from becoming farmers. The announcement in the budget that UTT is to offer six undergraduate degrees including degrees in crop and livestock science undermines this concept. Further the apparent lack of activity so far in the development of agricultural research at UTT is also cause for concern. UTT has the potential to fill an important role in the agricultural sector. Let us hope that this hope will be realised.

        "CONTENT": "TWO Trinidad nationals were allegedly held by US Customs officers with close to $2 million worth of cocaine, four days apart, on Caribbean Airlines flights entering John F Kennedy Airport in New York. The first Trinidadian was held with cocaine hidden in frozen goat meat in his suitcase while the other had it concealed in his pants crotch. Court documents obtained exclusively by CCN, through the US District Court, Eastern District of New York, outlined in detail the arrest of both men in separate court documents. Trinidadian Yudistir Maharaj, according to the documents, left aboard a Caribbean Airlines flight from Piarco International Airport, destined for JFK International Airport in New York, on March 20, and was caught by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) allegedly attempting to smuggle cocaine into that country. According to court documents, Maharaj \"did knowingly and intentionally attempt to import a controlled substance into the United States\". Maharaj, according to the complaint, was selected for an examination by US Customs after arriving on Caribbean Airlines flight 520. Special agent Michael Martinez indicated Maharaj \"presented a checked-in, large black suitcase and a laptop bag for inspection. When the officers examined the suitcase, they found three packages in the suitcase, which Maharaj claimed \"in sum and substance contained frozen cooked goat meat. The three packages were X-rayed revealing a square-like object inside of each one\". The CBP officers later took Maharaj into a private room and, according to Martinez in the court docket, \"drilled into the packa-ges and discovered a pow- dery-white substance, which later tested positive for the presence of cocaine.\" In total, 3,335.2 grammes of cocaine were seized from food containers in Maharaj's luggage. This works out to approximately just over three kilogrammes of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $1.2 million to $1.8 million. Maharaj, in his statement, claimed he did not know the narcotics were in his suitcase. Four days after that incident, another Trinidadian, Alister King, was also held for allegedly attempting to smuggle cocaine into New York after leaving Trinidad aboard Caribbean Airlines flight 520. King, who was stopped for a routine search, according to US special agent Derek Bergman, \"appeared nervous\". King's personal baggage was searched and it was during this search, King appeared nervous, Bergman stated. Bergman revealed in the court document a full-body search was authorised and \"a bulky item was discovered in the defendant's groin area\". Officers later found three packages containing a white, powdery substance \u2014which was later tested and found to be cocaine. The three packages weighed some 536.9 grammes, just over a kilogramme\u2014with a street value of $400,000 to $600,000. King told the US authorities he \"was supposed to be paid 30 per cent of the proceeds after the cocaine was sold\".

Lingchung, 23 of Chaguanas, told San Fernando magistrate Indar Jagroo he was not guilty of the four charges read to him. It was alleged that on Saturday at Instant Winner Members Club at SS Erin Road, Debe, he together with others armed with a firearm, robbed employee Vidya Goorcharan of $58,354 the property of the establishment and a $2,000 cellular phone, a $100 purse and an identification card.

        "CONTENT": " Any reduction in crime in our beleaguered nation is worthy of measured satisfaction and deserving of encouragement. At the same time, jumping the gun can be ill-advised, especially if it encourages complacency in the ongoing battle to bring criminal activity down to manageable levels. The People's Partnership has been in office for less than four months, which is far too short a period to reveal any pattern in crime statistics. Its claims of success in turning around crime are thus premature. Even acting Police Commissioner Stephen Williams's eight-month comparisons, between selected indicators for January to August this year and the corresponding period last year, may not be statistically significant. Past data have shown similar promising declines which were mocked by the increased year-end totals. The Police Service's figures, for example, showed no murders in January 2008, but that year ended with 547 homicides, which was a 40 per cent increase over the 2007 total. The current decline in robberies and vehicle thefts may be similarly reversed if these crimes spike over the remaining months of 2010. Additionally, there is the question of whether police statistics reflect the true state of the country. The Police Service can only collate reported crimes, but the Central Statistical Office's data show that a significant percentage of crimes go unreported. One survey carried out by criminologist Prof Ramesh Deosaran also revealed that two out of every three crimes may never be recorded by the police. Only if such victims' surveys are done on an annual basis can the authorities estimate the real levels of crime. Moreover, the main reason given by victims for not reporting crimes is lack of confidence in the police. In this regard, it is especially encouraging that acting Commissioner Williams moved with such decisive speed to stop the rot with the Repeat Offenders Task Force, immediately sending 35 officers on leave, pending investigation into the allegations made against them. This is a much-needed improvement over the lack of action (beyond transferring officers) typically displayed when, to cite just one egregious incident, guns and drugs were found in the ceiling of the St Joseph Police Station. If such disciplinary action can be sustained and followed through, a resulting clean-out of police evildoers will do much to restore citizens' confidence and increase the morale of those good officers who are undermined by the heavy presence of rotten eggs among their colleagues. As has been the case with these apparent declines before, the challenge is to sustain the reduction, without any let-up in the pressure on what caused the initial successes. The police can be assured that, if they have indeed begun to win the fight against crime, they will have the support of law-abiding citizens, and their contributions to further successes.

Photo: Elizabeth Williams A portion of the Plymouth jetty has collapsed, making it difficult for fishermen to access their vessels when venturing out to sea. Tobago fisherman Rennie Richardson has called the entire situation a travesty for Plymouth fisherfolk. Richardson, who last September was lost at sea and rescued by Grenadian fishermen, is disappointed with the latest turn of events. The concrete slab broke off last week with a bang. Richardson said luckily no one was on the jetty at the time. \u201cIs thank God nobody was walking there that day...someone would have died. I was there that day when it fall. If you hear how that thing struck. I thank God nobody was on it that morning,\u201d Richardson said on Monday. Fisherman Kemba Lawrence said the jetty remains essential to the fishing village of Plymouth and due to the present state of the deteriorating structure, fishermen now have to swim to their boats. There is also no fishing facility in the village. \u201cWe need this jetty right now because fishermen to access their boats after they bring in their catch is very hard. The water very calm right now so we could be able to come in to shore and offload the fish but if the water get rougher than this, we cannot come in nowhere to offload,\u201d Lawrence said. Richardson is calling on the authorities to assist in fixing the jetty, which has been a longstanding issue for several years. \u201cWe want help from the Government to give Plymouth a jetty, something for the fisherfolk to use. Time enough,\u201d Richardson said. The Plymouth jetty was built by Francis Gillette. When asked to comment on the matter, Gillette said he is aware of the state of the jetty and intends to demolish and reconstruct the structure. To demolish the structure will cost approximately $3 million. Gillette built the structure in 1992 and has in his possession a deed to lease the State lands in the area, inclusive of the Plymouth play park. The matter has been a controversial one between Gillette and the Tobago House of Assembly (THA), as the THA in previous years announced its intention to demolish the structure and rebuild, but was stopped by Gilette after the intervention of his lawyers. Gillette said it is his intention to discuss the way forward in the matter with THA Chief Secretary Kelvin Charles. \u201cNO chit.

Shawn James with his wife Maria Ramirez Alvarez and her six-year-old daughter outside Achievors Banquet Hall in Duncan Village, San Fernando waiting to register yesterday.

Thousands of desperate people gathered outside the Achievors Banquet Hall in San Fernando waiting to be let onto the compound. Reform Village resident Shawn James said that after visiting the centre in San Fernando three times with his Venezuelan wife, they had failed to have her processed. As a result, he has decided to take nine months pregnant Maria Ramirez Alvarez and her six-year-old daughter to Tobago to get registered. Speaking with the Express, James said Ramirez Alvarez is expected to deliver her baby on Saturday and was not given any priority to register. \u201cIt is a first-come, first-served type of system. The numbering system they had fell through. There is no consistent way to monitor what is taking place outside the office. We got here again at 2 a.m. and there were already over 100 people waiting. Because she is expected to have the baby soon, she is frustrated, tired and very much uncomfortable. We haven\u2019t had a proper night\u2019s rest as yet. \u201cWe cannot keep doing this, going back and forth like this, especially when she could have contractions at any time and have the baby. I am taking my chances in Tobago. They don\u2019t have as many people as the centres here,\u201d he said. James said Ramirez Alvarez worked as a news anchor in Venezuela and has been in Trinidad for the past 18 months. He said she did not initially intend to stay in Trinidad and has been registered at the Living Water Community, which has partnered with the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). However, he said given that the system of registration with UNHCR is different from the one being offered by the State, they have decided to register under the current migrant process which would allow her to get a work permit. \u201cNO chit.

        "CONTENT": "Overall leader: Jonas Schmeiser Overall leader: Jonas Schmeiser BECAUSE of continuous rains throughout this year watermelon farmers in the Bush Bush area of Kernahan, Mayaro, lost thousands of dollars worth of watermelon crops. Ramsingh Mahabir, a melon farmer for the past 27 years, pointed to the hillside that was now replanted with a fresh crop. \"Farmers in Bush Bush usually plant watermelon on hilly land so that the water would not affect the crop. There is too much water on the flat for crops to grow. However, this year, with the months of rain, the hill land remained wet. The coldness brought on the dreaded 'gummy stem blight disease'. This disease is caused by the fungus Didymella bryonia. It affects the leaves with what we call 'bacteria leaf spot' and there is oozing of a gummy substance from the infected stem. \"We watched most of our melon rotting away in the dampness. There was nothing we could do as the rain continued.\" Mahabir and other farmers counted their losses that amounted to more than $15,000 in investment and much more in potential sales. \"This is usual when there is plenty rain. When this happens, sometimes you manage to get 20 per cent of your crop. However, this year was the worst. We watched all the leaves falling out as the crop melted. In this state, the melon has no taste and it is hard like cucumber. \"When you plant 25,000 pounds per acre and you only get 20 per cent of the crop earlier than harvest time, there is no money to be made. You still have to try to sell it out because melon is perishable. First-class melon goes for $1.50 per pound, but when you get too much at one time it goes for only 20 cents. \"Farmers can plant up to three crops per year as long as they maintain the land but most settle for two crops per year to give the soil a chance to rest. We practise a system of rotation with tomato, cucumber, bodi, ochro, pepper and other short-term crops.\" The dry season also brings woes to melon farmers. Mahabir shook some leaves over a sheet of writing paper and dozens of minute insects were seen crawling over the white surface. This was the thrips insect. This one-millimetre-long insect represents one of the many headaches that melon farmers are forced to face. The thrips insect feeds at night, puncturing and sucking up the melon. One thrips lays between 500 to 700 eggs. This species of thrips is considered a pest because it feeds on plants with commercial value. \"When thrips invades your crop, you see all the leaves and the head of the melon turning yellow. This happens in the dry season when there is no rain. With the two weeks of sun we are now getting, thrips is back. \"This now puts us in more expense as we have to use medicines to try to save our crop. We use one teaspoon of NewMectin to four gallons of water to fight the insects on the outside of the plants. We also use 12 spoons of Pronto to three gallons of water. Pronto gets inside the plant to fight the thrips.\" When farmers thought that their troubles had passed for this year, they have now discovered a new threat to their melon crops. Mahabir picked up a melon inflicted with vertical cracks along the top half. \"None of the farmers knows what disease this is. This is a new disease that is destroying melon crops throughout the area. When you see these cracks appear you know that the inside of the melon will be affected. This field was planted almost two and a half months ago, which means that it is just about ready to be harvested. Now with this new disease, it looks like we will suffer more losses. Mahabir has since sent a sample to be tested at the Research Division, Central Experiment Station of the Ministry of Food Production, Land and Marine Affairs. Farmers in Bush Bush are regarded as squatters. The forested area was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1968 and a prohibited area in 1989. According to farmers in the area, they plant their crops outside the reserve. 'There is a buffer line and we make sure that we plant outside of this. What we really need is a continuation of the pitch road up to the buffer line. There are about 15 farmers living after the point where the pitch road ends. We need less than half mile of road again so that farmers could transport their crops economically. \"We have to pay a tractor man $300 to transport 3,500 pounds just from this field to where the pitch reaches. Not everybody could afford to buy a tractor. Tourists that come to visit the sanctuary sometimes turn back because there is too much mud. \"Farmers are the ones who create employment in this area and without proper access road to our crops our livelihood is compromised.\" \u201cNO chit.

Venezuelan refugees wait their turn outside the registration centre in San Fernando on Friday. Photo: TREVOR WATSON Refugees International is appealing to the Government of T&T to extend the Venezuelan migrant registration process past today. And it is concerned over the possibility that arrests and deportations may follow the end of the process. In a statement issued Thursday, the international organisation reminded that the government initially proposed a two-week registration period with five centres to process 28,000 Venezuelans even though more than 40,000 Venezuelans live on the island. But only three registration centers opened and thousands of Venezuelans are still waiting to register. \u201cVenezuelans on the islands are trying to follow the rules,\u201d said Refugees International President Eric Schwartz. \u201cBut any registration process is time consuming and difficult for everyone. Venezuelans trying to meet the deadline should not be punished for that.\u201d It is clear the government must extend the registration period. At the very least, the government should allow Venezuelans who pre-registered online or who are already waiting in line at a registration center to complete their registration process even if it is after the June 14 deadline. TIME\u2019S ALMOST UP: The crowd of Venezuelan migrants outside the Queen\u2019s Park Oval registration centre on the 12th day of the two week process. We are especially concerned that Minister of National Security Stuart Young has periodically said that the regular immigration laws would immediately go back into effect on June 15. These laws have unfairly limited the rights of individuals in need of protection. The government of Trinidad and Tobago should honor its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol to respect the rights of asylum seekers, including those Venezuelans already registered under a separate process managed by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). In May, the UNHCR said most Venezuelans fleeing their country deserve international refugee protection\u201d. Schwartz said that Young also stated that Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s border patrol has \u201cbeen turning away boatloads of people.\u201d \u201cThis is unacceptable and irresponsible, and a violation of the principal of non-refoulement. Refugees International also urges the government to allow access to Venezuelans detained in the Immigration Detention Center for overstaying or \u201cillegal entry,\u201d and that they be allowed to register and be released.\u201d \u201cWe understand the challenges facing the government of Trinidad and Tobago, but the Venezuelans on the islands are fleeing a desperate situation back home,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cClearly, the number of Venezuelans now in line waiting to register is a reflection that they want to do the right thing. The government should do the same.\u201d Refugees International advocates for lifesaving assistance and protection for displaced people and promotes solutions to displacement crises.

PNM activist Darrel Dookoo poses with Minister Shamfa Cudjoe in June 2017 at a party event. People\u2019s National Movement (PNM) activist Darrel Dookoo says his livelihood is being affected because United National Congress (UNC) activists keep reporting him to Facebook and his profiles are being forcefully shut down. However, UNC Public Relations Officer (PRO) and Opposition Senator Anita Haynes refuted this saying the UNC is not attacking Dookoo and he (Dookoo) is one of thousands under the PNM who cannot get work. Dookoo, a comedian and landscaper told the Express by phone that his ability to obtain work has been very difficult especially since January this year when Princes Town MP Barry Padarath claimed that he (Dookoo) was given a contract by WASA for advertisements for a water conservation campaign. Dookoo said he was never contracted by WASA and in fact work is difficult as Government Ministers are keeping a distance. Dookoo said he feels extremely victimised and it was unfair that he is being targeted for his political affiliation. He said like any other citizen he has to work and feed his family. He presented proof to the Express in the form of a screen shot- where Facebook indicated to him that the \u2018complaining party\u2019 against him is the United National Congress. Dookoo said while he does a lot of commentary in support of the PNM he also does Facebook \u2018lives\u2019 and posts on non political issues- which also gets shut down. \u201cYesterday I did a live about relationships and telling ladies that you should love yourself because God has created you as a separate entity and you don\u2019t need anyone to validate your existence. Within 15 minutes that video disappeared. It did not violate any community standards but my Facebook page was shut down for 30 days,\u201d he said. Dookoo said his ability to market himself as a comedienne is also being affected as he uses social media to draw people to comedy shows he holds. \u201cI am frustrated this is how I build a forum, I have a concert every year, I sell tickets,\u201d he said. Dookoo said he supports the PNM \u2018even when they are wrong\u2019 and he was disappointed that his victimisation was impacting his ability to obtain work fairly. He said he has been a PNM activist for the past four years and every time he does a political blog it gets shut down. He said the length of time Facebook puts a block on you is like \u2018jail\u2019 as it can range from one day to a month to completely. In January The Satya Anand Ashram (SAA) submitted a complaint against Dookoo to the Equal Op\u00adpor\u00adtu\u00adni\u00adty Com\u00admis\u00adsion (EOC). There has been no word on that matter. Haynes said the UNC is not focused on Dookoo but on working towards good governance and removing the PNM from office. \u201cThere is no attack on Mr Dookoo, as a matter of fact it is very telling that even the PNM Ministers are now distancing themselves from Dookoo, and it could be because posturing he has adopted online, including but not limited to his continuous attacks on the Political Leader,\u201d she said. \u201cMr Dookoo joins thousands of citizens who cannot get work because of the direct actions of this PNM administration. The UNC continues to champion the cause of the unemployed and underemployed which is why we are presenting our plans for job creation. There is no attack on Mr Dookoo, the UNC is focused on this Government\u2019s systematic attack on our democracy as I am sure the rest of the country is,\u201d she added.

        "CONTENT": "Commissioner of Police Gary Griffith Commissioner of Police Gary Griffith Commissioner of Police Gary Griffith says that the Intelligence agencies have revealed that there are over 50 \" shooters\", linked to various gangs, with most being active in taking out hits on opposing gang members. And this has proven to be the root cause of a significant number of homicides in this country via gang activity, he says. These individuals walk around with their firearms, knowing quite well that if held, it is usually a simple case of going to court next day, acquiring bail, and being issued with another firearm, to carry out their trade; which involves killing persons in cold blood, according to Griffith. In a statement on Monday, Griffith said the Bail Amendment Bill was a critical tool to providing both a strong deterrent as well as ensuring that if and when such criminal elements are held, they can remain where they belong. In the last decade, over 75% of homicides were carried out by persons with illegal firearms in this country, and most by a select few, he said. Presently, anyone who is apprehended with a firearm, could be released on bail and be free to possibly assassinate the same person who was the informant that caused their initial arrest. \u201cThis improper system has proven to be a liability in getting law abiding citizens to come forward and pinpoint possible shooters with illegal weapons.\u201d Griffith said that someone who has been arrested for possession of an illegal firearm must not be granted bail. He believes that possession of an illegal firearm is enough for someone to lose their freedom and have bail restricted for 120 days. He said this approach takes the guns away from criminals and gets potential cold-blooded murderers, off the streets. He said those who speak about Constitutional rights being infringed should also be cognizant of the right to life which is, in fact, the ultimate Constitutional right of all citizens. \u201cThis right is then taken away by cold-blooded criminal elements, who are armed with the knowledge that they can walk around with a weapon and if arrested, they can be released within 24 hours, if the amendment to this Bill is not granted.\u201d Said Griffith. He said amendments to this Bill would ensure that a criminal is incarcerated for 120 days, allowing victims to come forward, with the knowledge and the sense of safety and protection that the perpetrator is behind bars, which can also reduce the opportunity for reprisal. \u201c If someone is in possession of a firearm, it means that they have the intent to kill an innocent person in cold blood. The intent must be seen as being as dangerous as the action. A criminal with an illegal firearm has the capacity and capability to kill dozens of persons in cold blood with just one magazine. Such individuals should not be incarcerated only when they have committed the act. When this Law was enforced a few years ago, it proved to be instrumental in reducing crime; and the Commissioner believes that such a Law, when reinforced, can do so again.\u201d said Griffith.

Therefore it falls squarely under the definition of petroleum operations.\" He said Section 6:1 says no one shall engage in petroleum operations unless a licence is first obtained as provided for by this act and the regulations, and subsection 2 says a person who contravenes this section is liable upon summary conviction to a fine of $500,000 and in the case of a continued offence a further fine of $50,000 for every day the offence continues. \"My information (and investigation)...(and I may be wrong, I'm always subject to correction) is, Paria Fuel Trading Company Ltd is operating in TT without an approved licence by the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries.\" Mark said he would take his seat for a few seconds to allow Minister in the Finance Ministry Allyson West, who piloted the bill, to clear for the Senate whether Paria Fuel Trading has a licence that has been approved by the Energy Ministry. \"I will give her two seconds and I will rise again. I want to know the truth.\" West, however, made no move to rise. Mark said: \"Two seconds are up.

Edwards, 27, also said he would like to see prison reform and an eventual transfer of the energy sector that would make it greener and shrink the carbon footprint. On gender equality, Edwards said it would be a huge win if the right legislative changes are made to support the rights of LGBT people in TT. Asked what changes he thinks would be necessary, Edwards stressed amending the Equal Opportunity Act and spoke about the implementation of a gender policy responsive to the needs of the citizens. \"We have a gender policy that leaves out things such as recognising various sexual orientations,\" he said. \"We need to amend the Equal Opportunity Act to incorporate gender as a form of discrimination. As it stands right now, we do not have provisions for gender in the act. This means that the Equal Opportunity Commission cannot pick up matters where there are gender discrimination.\" Edwards said his party sees gender as defined by what people choose to identify as, and not tied to the sex which people are assigned at birth. He said gender is based on societal definitions and is different from sex, which is biological. \"Persons can choose to either identify as male or female,\" Edwards said. On abortion, Edwards said he is pro-choice, meaning he supports the decision of the woman to terminate the pregnancy. However, he said as of now he believes a termination should only occur before the heartbeat of the baby is detectable. A heartbeat is first detectable approximately 22 days after conception. \"I think detecting the heartbeat is an appropriate road to take, but then again many times women don't even know they are pregnant until after the 22 days have passed,\" he said. Where the woman bearing the child is at risk of death, he believes an abortion should be permitted, as well as in cases where she may have conceived as a result of sexual assault. Edwards said right now he believes an abortion beyond the first trimester threatens a life and would not be inclined to support that. Speaking about the decriminalsation of marijuana, Edwards said TT should look beyond that to legalisation, and once legalisation occurs, corporate monopolisation should not be allowed. \"They are currently persons waiting in line to monopolise a legalised environment and that is something we have to pay close attention to and monitor to ensure that everyone has a fair chance. We have seen certain conglomerates capitalise on alcohol and tobacco. We cannot have a situation where (if legal) paying for marijuana from a company becomes extremely expensive.\" On prison reform, Edwards said TT needs to use alternative dispute resolution rather than people being imprisoned for punitive reasons. He stressed the implementation of processes such as mediation, conciliation, arbitration and negotiation. \"I do think we need to reform the criminal justice system, moving away from this retributive or punitive system and instead incorporate restorative justice.\" Edwards said his legislative changes would ensure certain criminal matters are allowed to go to mediation first, reducing the number of casese taken to the court and \"clogging up the system.\" Edwards is the son of Hassan Atwell, one of three prisoners who escaped from the Frederick Street prison in 2015. The escapees killed a police officer after they shot their way out of the prison. Atwell was reportedly killed shortly aftwerwards by gang members. A percentage of the money that TT has collected from oil and gas, he said, should have been invested continuously in the Green Fund to ensure the development of a renewable energy sector. \"When we think about solar energy and turbines and so on, TT is ripe for those kinds of opportunities. It's high time that government invest significantly in these renewable forms of energy.\" Edwards said his party does not claim to have all the answers to all the problems, but that proper consultation would be taken on all the above issues before any significant action is taken if the party gains legislative power. Edwards studied communications at UWI, St Augustine, served in 2017 as an independent senator and is a motivational speaker with a Canadian-based firm. He launched the Progressive Party on June 16 and said since then it has received approximately 100 requests from people who would like to join. Edwards said the party does not have any financiers besides himself, but right now not much funding is needed. He said past funds have come out of his own pocket and that going forward, contributions will be accepted. **Just In** ",

Police officers with the guns they found Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi has piloted legislation which imposes life imprisonment for gun-related offences. The Firearms (Amendment) Bill targets repeat offenders and persons with three convictions will suffer jail for life. Firearm-related fines have also been increased up to $1 million. \u201cIf you are going to prosper in gang activity, if you are going to transfer firearms to people, if you are going rent a gun out as reputed in this country, if you have been caught on three occasions, you ought to forfeit your rights and privileges in this country,\u201d said Al-Rawi. He pointed out that in countries such as Singapore the sentence is death. The AG said the Bill speaks to a new provision for trafficking of firearms. He said the police have found high-powered weapons in many parts of Trinidad and Tobago. Al-Rawi said a person who has in his possession two or more firearms or prohibited weapons commits the offence of trafficking. He said the Bill imposes a burden on the accused to prove his innocence. A person found guilty of this offence is liable: (a) on summary conviction for a first offence to a fine of $1,000,000 and to imprisonment for 15 years; or (b) on conviction on indictment for a first offence to imprisonment for 20 years; (c) on conviction on indictment for a second offence to imprisonment for 25 years; and (d) on conviction on indictment for a third or any subsequent offence to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life. The AG provided figures from the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) to justify the increased fines and sentences. He said firearms seized in the last ten years, between 2009 to 2019, totalled 6,387. Al-Rawi said of this figure, the numbers of machine guns and high-powered weapons have been increasing in the past few years. He said there is a prevalence of hundreds of high-powered weapons. The AG said the reports of firearm-related offences for this same period totalled 17,363. The number of arrests for possession of firearms was 5,391. Al-Rawi went further to state that from 2015 to June 2019, there were 1,679 murders that were gun-related. He said 638 of these were gang-related. He further disclosed that in remand there are currently 354 inmates who are charged with firearm-related offences. In the prisons, he said, there are 246 who have been convicted for firearm-related offences and of those 37 are repeat offenders. The AG said the figures for woundings and shootings are in the thousands. Al-Rawi said legislation speaks to no bail for persons with high-powered weapons. \u201cYou have no reason on this good planet to find yourself in possession of an AK47, of high-powered weapons and sub-machine guns, and be asking a court for bail,\u201d he said.

Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley and Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley\u2019s \u2018wajang\u2019 behaviour places Trinidad and Tobago at risk if United States President Donald Trump pulls support to the Caribbean basin programme says Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar. \u201cPrime Minister of little Trinidad and Tobago he get so big he want to bouf up Trump. Well we\u2019ll find out who is the bigger Trump soon to come,\u201d she said at the United National Congress (UNC) public meeting on Monday at the Aranguez North Secondary school. She noted Rowley\u2019s criticism of the United States Department of State in its 2019 Trafficking in Persons (TiPs) report which gave this country an F-grade in terms of its handling of human trafficking. Rowley criticised the report as he slammed the US own foreign policy. \u2018We got an F, they say. Well, if I (were) marking their paper, what would I give them? They have the same problem that we have - thousands of migrants rushing your border wanting to come into your country because they see a greener grass on your side than on their side,\u2019 he said. Rowley added: \u2018That is the number one political issue in America! Hundreds of thousands of people, and their own people are telling you that those people, some of them, are treated like dogs and cattle. \u2018Children are dying on the border, some of them in cages, hundreds of people in a room that was made for ten. \u2018The temperature is 41 degrees, and of course, they have a bigger military. They\u2019ve got a bigger security system. They\u2019ve got an army, a navy, an air force, and they\u2019ve got a bigger Treasury than T& T. Persad-Bissessar said Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s foreign policy and diplomacy has failed as she knocked Foreign Affairs Minister Dennis Moses as the man whom no one can understand when he speaks. She said this was not the first time Rowley has \u2018boufed\u2019 the US as she noted that earlier this year Rowley also criticised the US Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago Joseph N. Mondello. In January this year, Mondello de\u00adscribed as \u201cdeeply con\u00adcern\u00ading\u201d state\u00adments com\u00ading from the T&T Gov\u00adern\u00adment recog\u00adnis\u00ading the \u201cun\u00adde\u00admo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic and il\u00adle\u00adgit\u00adi\u00admate gov\u00adern\u00adment\u201d of Nicholas Maduro in Venezuela. Hours lat\u00ader, in the Parliament Row\u00adley fired back at Am\u00adbas\u00adsador Mon\u00addel\u00adlo\u2019s state\u00adment saying he took umbrage. Persad-Bissessar said back then she warned that the US is this country\u2019s largest trading partner. \u201cAnd Madame WPC, Woman Police Constable Camille in the Parliament when we were there objecting to the manner in which MR Rowley was behaving, Camille say \u2018so what? What Trump go do we?\u2019 Well let me tell you what Trump can do you and do Trinidad and Tobago,\u201d said Persad-Bissessar. She said the Caribbean basin initiative programme allows this country preferential privileges with respect to trade with the US. \u201cThat has to come up for renewal in the Congress of the United States of America next year. You want to know what Trump can do you? Trump has the power to determine whether that programme will continue for the benefit of the people of Trinidad and Tobago, that is what Trump can do you,\u201d she said. She added the US report was about human trafficking. \u201cThe late Mr Manning, may his soul rest in peace he was right when he described Mr Rowley as wajang, rotweiler, every time the man speaks he shouting at someone,\u201d she said. She also noted that the Rowley\u2019s \u2018whole cabinet\u2019 was present to open a road in Chaguanas - an initiative which she said stemmed from her Government. Persad-Bissessar also responded to Movement for Social Justice (MSJ) head David Abdullah who called her a \u2018wolf\u2019. She said she is one as she leads a pack for change. The former Prime Minister noted the words of novelist Rudyard Kipling \u201cFor the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.\u201d \u201cSo my strength comes from you and that strength you give me I give back to you for us to fight this wicked PNM Government,\u201d she said. She also spoke about the story of two wolves that resides in the being- one of destruction and the other of compassion. \u201cToday I say I am that wolf of compassion that is in side of me and we must never ever let the detractors filled with hate and envy and pain, they must never ever take away the love we have for each other and the hope and the vision we share for a better Trinidad and Tobago,\u201d she said.

The in-camera hearing took place before Justice Jacqueline Wilson at the Hall of Justice in Port of Spain and lasted just over five hours, ending with the judge reser\u00adving her ruling on the matter until sometime today \u201cbefore Parliament begins\u201d at 1.30 p.m. Moonilal is seeking to have the court stop the Parliament from debating on a report of the Privileges Committee, which recommended that he apologise to Laventille West MP Fitzgerald Hinds for uttering the words \u201cSnake have lead for you\u201d in cross-talk during the budget debate last October. Before the matter was called, Moonilal told members of the media he had no issue apologising to Hinds, but the issue at hand was more than just issuing an apo\u00adlogy. \u201cSnake\u201d (Richard Marcelle) was (at or around) the material time charged with assaulting Hinds during an incident in the Beetham Gardens. \u201cI Roodal Moonilal am not above the law. This is not just a simple matter about apologising to Mr Hinds or not apologising to Mr Hinds. I have no difficulty apologi\u00adsing to Mr Hinds. In Parliament, we always apologise for what we said, what we do. That\u2019s a run-of-the-mill type of thing, so it is not an issue as to whether you apologise or not. \u201cThere are serious and deeper issues here as to the rule of law as to constitutional rights and protection of those rights. The court is where you come to assert and protect your constitutional rights, not the Parliament,\u201d he said.

POLICE are hunting for a child rapist who allegedly used an app to track a 14 year old girl to a Siparia sporting complex where he assaulted her on Saturday. The victim\u2019s hands, feet and neck were bound with tie straps by the man who left her after the attack. The teenager was rescued an hour later by someone who went to the sporting complex to exercise. It happened a short distance away from the two Siparia Police Stations. Police said they have a description of the man but the girl did not know his full name, age, nor where he lived. The victim told police officers that a few months ago she had been introduced to the man by one of her friends via Facebook. She said that they exchanged cell phone numbers and had conversations on WhatsApp. A few weeks ago during a WhatsApp conversation, the man told the girl that he wished to have a relationship with her. She said she refused, and blocked his number from her phone. He continued to pursue her, she said, and days later he called her using another cell phone. The girl told police that on Saturday she was in the pavilion area of the sporting complex when the man approached her. She said that they talked and he told her that he had an app on his phone to track her cell phone. He convinced her to walk with him to an area leading to the wash rooms. The said that the man overpowered her and using tie straps he tied her hands and feet. He then pulled her tee shirt over her head and attached a tie strap. Police said the victim said she had screamed for help, but her screams were muffled by the tee shirt. Officers of the Siparia Police station were contacted and took the girl to the Siparia District Health Centre then San Fernando General Hospital for treatment.

ABANDONED: The family's new home in San Francique Armed with a blow torch, a gang of \u201cprofessional thieves\u201d broke into the home of a Penal family and robbed them of thousands in cash and valuables early Tuesday. The thieves were \u201corganised\u201d in their approach to the robbery, with one being the mastermind and another whose only job was to wipe away fingerprints. The attack happened at Gayah Trace, San Francique, at a home still under construction owned by a 40-year-old man, his 32-year-old wife, and two children, aged eight and two years. The man is employed as a salesman and the woman is a housewife. While they were not physically harmed, the 30-minute ordeal has left the family traumatised and they have packed their belongings and left their new home. \u201cImagine sleeping in the dead of night and you hear a banging on your door and people shouting \u2018we coming in!\u2019 This is a different level of crime,\u201d the woman said. It is believed that one of four men scaled the wall and unlocked a gate at the back of the house, through which three other thieves entered the premises. Another man waited in the getaway car parked nearby. Using a blow torch, the thieves cut through another metal door and burglar proofing, and entered the house. It was around 3.30 a.m. when the family was awakened by the banging on the bedroom door on the ground floor of their home. The woman said four thieves, wearing hats, faces covered with bandanas, and armed with guns and cutlasses, burst through the door. Using duct tape, the thieves bound the couple\u2019s hands, feet and covered their mouths. The children awoke and cried as their parents were held accosted by the thieves. The woman said that it appeared that the thieves had co-ordinated their approach in the robbery. \u201cThey were very professional and they knew what they were doing. One was talking on a cell phone the whole time, and telling the others what to do and to \u2018hurry up\u2019. While one person was pulling out the drawers and grabbing things, another man was wiping away the fingerprints the others were leaving,\u201d she told the Express. The woman said her husband and sons were left in the bedroom and two of the thieves took her through each room of the house to show where the valuables were kept. They packed up a quantity of US and local currency, household items, the couple\u2019s wallets, jewelry, and appliances. However, the thieves did not get time to pack all of the loot as one of the neighbours realised that a robbery was in progress and turned the lights on in his house. \u201cThe dogs were constantly barking and apparently one of the neighbours switched on his lights. He called the police. The bandits then hurried up and left before the police came,\u201d she said. She said that several bottles of alcohol were left behind by the thieves. The thieves escaped through the way they entered and drove away in the waiting vehicle. The woman said that the tape on her mouth became loose and she tried to bite the duct tape off her hands. \u201cMy older boy was so traumatised. He was crying and told me don\u2019t bite it off because \u2018they coming back\u2019. He was so scared, he did not want to move because he thought the bandits were coming back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe left the house a few hours later and my older son doesn\u2019t want to go back. He has not slept since the incident. I might have to get counselling for him. The baby is oblivious to what happened. We will not be returning to our home anytime soon,\u201d she said. Ag Cpl Gocool, and WPCs Frederick, Blaize and Mohammed responded but no one was arrested. Police were unable to obtain a \u201cworkable\u201d fingerprint from the crime scene, not even on the bottles of alcohol that were left behind. Residents said the community had been targeted by criminals and within the last two years almost every house had fallen victim to thieves. The couple\u2019s next-door neighbour said that two years ago her husband was tied up and robbed in their house by criminals who attacked him at noon after he returned from shopping. Other residents have had their poultry and vegetables stolen. \u201cThis area was mainly agricultural land, for rice and sugar cane planting, but now things have changed and it is a residential community. But as fast as we build a house, people being attacked by bandits. They taking anything they get their hands on, from your ducks to your vegetables to your money,\u201d a resident said.
