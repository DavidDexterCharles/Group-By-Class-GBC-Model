Individuals should wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces in public areas. If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can be used as an alternative. Moreover, individuals should avoid touching their face, particularly their eyes, nose, and mouth, to reduce the risk of transferring germs from their hands. These simple hygiene practices can help protect against a wide range of infectious diseases, including respiratory infections like COVID-19.",

Additionally, individuals should ensure that their masks fit properly and avoid touching or adjusting them while wearing them. Masks are particularly important in crowded or indoor settings where the risk of transmission is higher.",
